I should have separated the two for clarity, sorry @Ankush !    I am so glad you 'can do without the smoking',  that is all that matters, every moment, every day....
    Thank you for clarifying @Sazerac
    My fear was that not having that first smoke of the morning was going to be an awful way to start the day and that it would be all downhill from there.     Most every other misguided fear mentioned in this thread also applied to me.        I really let myself get snared in the addiction.
    Most all of what was posted but the two big things were my morning coffee on the porch or when I was driving (I always "enjoyed" smoking while on the road).  I seemed to have gotten past all those but I still stay on guard!!!

I still can't understand how my non-smoking gf at the time did not dump me for this (I was a non-smoker when she met me but I started again). I'd go to bed stinking of a cigarette and get out of it in the morning to have my fix. Ugh...
    The group of "outcasts" I smoked with at every social event. We were the ones who stepped outside to sneak a smoke outside. I met some very nice people in this arena. The conversations were great. In fact, I still miss these impromptu meetings. 
    Thought I'd miss my answer to everything: boredom,  fear,  social akwardness, lonelyness etc. etc. All things existential. Turned out to be a big fat lie, BUT: One I have to remind myself over and over about. At times its frustrating, but still a million times better than be back at nasty, pride consuming smoking.

    When I can stand the stench,    I still go outside to talk to people,   to look at the stars,   to gather my thoughts.  Smoking is not a part of it anymore, that is all.

    This is a great question and I've been straining to come up with an answer and have none.  I was tired of the social stigma, the smell, the cost, the fact that my day revolved around when/where I could smoke, jonesing for a smoke when on a flight or any other situation that I couldn't smoke, standing out in rain/cold to smoke.        It was frustrating that I was stuck in this addiction and was dead-set on quitting and getting my freedom back and have a real peace of mind (not the false peace of mind when you finally relieve a craving by lighting up).       So my answer is nothing.   Don't miss it or anything about it AT ALL.
    Worried about going to the loo.  How do you make morning stuff happen without a cigarette.  I thought I'd miss my 'me time with my cig' but there are other much better ways to find me time.

    I decided to quit the day before I did quit so there wasn't much time to think about anything let alone one specific thing I would miss. There was just a dark cloud of trepidation as to how I would possibly be able to quit doing something I loved doing and had done all my life pretty much. Funny how one's perspective can change so completely in such a short period of time. I don't miss anything about smoking now - nothing!

    Keep busy.... It does help ....bumping this ..feel free to add ...
I lurked here and learned all I could about addiction.  I danced wildly. I walked willfully.    I sang, took screaming showers, went down to the tracks and primal screamed when a train rolled by (love that). I yelled, 'FREE YOUR HEAD' over and over and over.  I buffed out my fingernails, my toenails to a gloss.    I did a super detail house clean, top to bottom.  Everything smelled so good.   Washed all my clothes, shined all my boots. Drawers were artistically arranged, closets compulsively organized.     Folders of personal ephemera were sorted,  letters bound with ribbon to save.   The purge had no boundaries and I threw out a ton of detritus.      It also looked like I had gone to 'the agent orange school of gardening'    there wasn't a 'weed' anywhere, everything horribly neat and tidy.  Thankfully, I resumed my happy garden to it's riotous nature    but, I do miss that neat-nik woman keeping my house spic 'n span, where'd she go ?      Thanks for bumping this, @Doreensfree   great to see the 'old' faces.   I was still lurking back then and these were some of my heroes, two months later, I joined with a 10 month quit under my belt.           Edited July 2 by Sazerac

    I think that as you gain confidence in your successful quit you will find that the skills used in quitting can be applied to other aspects in your life.        For example, the notion of H.A.L.T. are you Hungry, Angry (which can be switched to emotional), Lonesome, Tired.        To this day, I turn to this technique for a variety of reasons and situations.  While it may not solve the underlying issue, it certainly alleviates compounding any distress by addressing these issues    and I am better able to solve the problem if I am, at least, fed and well rested.       Another example of using a quitting skill is deep breathing !   an excellent technique to calm myself and think more clearly.   A conscious flow of Oxygen is a panacea, the handiest of magic elixirs !        Just knowing that we have the ability to change,    and acknowledging  the proof that we Have Changed, (we quit smoking!)   gives us encouragement to change other things in our life.      I know many of us have changed other aspects in our lives with 'quit smoking' skills.   The self-confidence acquired in quitting, especially, encouraged me in any endeavor.        What skills have you learned in quitting smoking    and how have you applied them to your fabulous nicotine free life ?
    I learned a lot about having empathy for people and their struggles.  I am more kind towards people, a good transferable skill useful in many parts of my life.         At the same time, I learned to recognize junkie thinking and reasons for it.  Also a good transferable skill that can keep me from having empathy for someone who doesn't deserve it.
    I stopped making excuses and addressed a major issue head-on.       I stopped telling myself that I couldn't do it and put my head down and did it.     I made a commitment to myself and followed through.     I stayed focused on the big picture and wouldn't allow temporary feelings or events put me off course.      I built positive momentum for myself, success begets success, and used that momentum to make improvements in other areas of my life.        The basic tenets of a successful quit can be laid out as a blueprint for success in most any endeavor.
    Our friend, Joel Spitzer, has a great vid    
    Ok...when I quit, I had a plan....date and time and supplies.   My husband quit spontaneously.  I am trying to help a friend quit....she has tried several times spontaneously "this is the last one"...... Everyone is different of course but how did you do it ? plan.....no plan. ?
A plan gets my vote (A plan to fight the craves/triggers)Edited June 27 by Whispers
    I didn't have a plan because I didn't know I should have one but I knew I needed to quit so I prepared by not smoking in the areas I smoked in. That enabled me to disassociate those places with smoking and as a result I could go into those areas and not crave a smoke.    Your friend is lucky to have you to get clues from. I would also recommend telling them about us so we can help support them 
    Plain and simple I had no plan.  I was fortunate enough to find the forum and do it with support.   I think the biggest part of quitting is realizing that it is possible and everyone has the power within to do it.   I would advise your friend to do the homework and read all the information available here.      Hopefully it will help ease her into the process needed to quit.
Great to see you, Parsley,  congrats on your 10 months of Freedom ! Hope you have escaped all the flooding in your part of the world.       I quit on a whim and as a personal challenge to myself. I was completely ignorant about addiction.  I lurked here and there, educating myself and joined the QTrain in the tenth month, or so, of my quit,  thankful to everybody that had shared their stories and for the incredible resource of information compiled here.
I was already fed up of being a smoker but never managed to quit, Joel's videos encouraged me to take the step of going cold turkey and so I made a plan. Big part of my plan was to join a forum for people who wanted to or had quit smoking. The other part of my plan was to keep make myself mentally prepared for the withdrawal of the first 3 days. I had come to know to have a lot of juice and water (during the first 3 days) and to do deep breathing. Once I joined the Train, I just stuck to the NOPE pledge and stayed quit a day at a time (and am still staying quit). The support I received during the initial days of joining the Train was also very helpful.        Bottom line - every person will have their own way of quitting smoking.
    I started reading everything to know what I was up against.  Everything I felt or experienced was laid out and explained by those that had already quit; there is plenty of information (and support) online. An educated quit is a strong quit.  
    "Plans" for quitting are generally code for "procrastination."  "I can't quit until I've got my Magic Plan in place ... "   Just quit now.  EZPZ
    I really had no plan at the beginning only a desire to quit.  As I went into my quit during the first week I set up kind of plan and that was to educate myself more and to find support -- that is how I got here!!!
    Thank you for all of your responses I have in fact told her about this site . And I agree not one shoe fits all .   Still very wet here as far as flooding goes, it has been a dreadfully wet year I really feel bad for the farmers it's not good  Sorry for the multiple post but I'm not on here much just wanted you to know I bought an opal and diamond ring with my money saved from not smoking !
    One more thing that I remember from when I was getting ready to quit it is true that it is a lot of procrastination I couldn't be this day and it couldn't be that day and it couldn't be this day and it couldn't be that day, so I could have avoided that if I had just done it spontaneously.
"A goal without a plan is just a dream"     Someone said that once..        You have to have a plan. You wouldn't just hop in a boat and attempt to sail to Thailand would you? No, you would plan the trip. Map it out and pack supplies, etc.     Quitting smoking is the same.       Benjamin Franklin supposedly once said, “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."         
    I understand what you're saying about a plan and I was successful with the plan , because I finally put down my foot and did it but it sounds like some people have a plan that drags on forever . So there again I guess there are many ways to do things whatever works I guess is the only thing that matters 
My first quit i just quit with no plan outside of the words of a good friend who had been quit, he said just get through the first month and you're in the clear. I believed him and that quit was quite easy but blown at 2 1/2 years. I wasn't educated on the addiction and had no plan to face the triggers and craves as i really thought i was done with them. This quit i learned and have that plan to face the triggers/craves head on if they ever come back and i educated myself and i also learn from others stories. Move a muscle, change a thought is golden for me . BTW my friend who gave me that advice back in 2010 has blown his quit as still smoking to day(just get through the month)..           FWIW
    Absolutely! And wholeheartedly! This site made my quit happen for me , I fell off the wagon once and came back and you've helped me through and I am here smoke-free as is my husband ! Alan Carr's book was also huge to me 
I just re-read my first post here:   'Hi there, this is me introducing myself. First time here,  but not new to this whole quitting thing. Have been smoking on and off since I was 15 (in my mid-thirties right now). My most serious quit lasted for three whole years. I am sweating carrots  (yes, in Holland we do that when we are afraid) by the thought alone, to start this journey all over again. I am not so sure how to handle it this time. I feel like I know everything there is to know  and still don't feel confident enough. In the past I used to read a lot about addiction, fear, etc. I bought different kinds of cleansing﻿﻿﻿﻿ tea, drank water until I became a water balloon, tried to meditate and then always ended up failing miserably. I have a history of depression and anxiety. I also have ﻿the experience of becoming calmer and much more relaxed at non-smoking life, but only gradually after the first year. I know it will take time. I know I want to take that time. And still I am terrified.  My quit date is next friday, 24-08-2018. I shall look around a bit, hopefully i﻿t will motivate me. I do not need willpower or pride, but faith. That much I know..'        So, not really a plan, 'just' a strong desire. I think thats mainly what got me through so far. For me, every phase is so different and I have no golden rule exept  not lighting the damn thing.
I had a plan, but it turned out to be pretty much useless.  For instance: I spent a lot of time thinking about how I was going to deal with being around other people smoking.  Then I quit and found that I was indifferent to other people smoking.  The sight of someone smoking and the smell of the cigarette had no affect on me either negative or positive.     I don't like nitpicking over semantics, but I would go with preparation over planning when starting the quitting process.  Learn about the nicotine trap, the psychology of addiction, and the misguided "beliefs" that lead to us "needing" a cigarette.  If you're firmly rooted in the fundamentals you can sort everything else out with ease.          6 hours ago, sgt.barney said:               "Plans" for quitting are generally code for "procrastination."          "I can't quit until I've got my Magic Plan in place ...

    No plan whatsoever.  Went to bed and committed to quit the next morning.  The only weapon in my arsenal was to berate myself for being a weak "kitty" (insert synonym) whenever I felt I might cave in.  True story.  And it worked.
    I planned many times to quit.  I planned and made an appointment with a hypnotist and that plan failed.  I planned and made an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic for their smoking cessation and went to one appointment - that plan failed.  I planned to quit this day and planned to quit that day.  I would buy the patches and would use half before returning to smoking.   I even tried the gum.   When I found the forum, I started reading and decided that I wanted to be a part of this group.  I just stopped.  My only plan now is to continue smoke free.   I do not know what the magic formula of this forum is.  I did start to have a high regard for the people fighting to save lives.  I wanted to give them success.  I could not let them down.     
    Some people use a Quit "toolbox"         
I quit suddenly in the middle of the day without a plan. It's like something just flipped in the right position in my head and I was just done. I was sick of it and increasingly annoyed at myself for previously blowing a nearly year-long quit due to basically getting cocky, i.e. "I've now beaten this addiction, I can smoke socially if I feel like it and leave it at that + all the other BS lies I fed myself so I would be "allowed" to smoke again. Of course that social smoking plan quickly turned into me smoking full time just like I had done before... duh. So this last time I just had enough. I was on the street, took a cigarette out of the pack, realised it was the last one of the pack and I'd have to go get some more, and I thought what and idiot I was for ever blowing my previous quit. And then something just flipped in my head and I was done. I decided there and then that I will never smoke again, this is it, I'm not doing this anymore, ever again. And I didn't buy more, I went home instead and signed up to a forum and posted on there straight away.        7 years later that was without a doubt the best moment of clarity I've ever had.
    Please, stop it with any bullshit about How To Quit.    All it has to do with is your choice.   Either, you smoke or, you don't smoke.  Personally, I don't care how you get there. The happiness comes with your choice,  TO BE FREE  and accept ,  Not One Puff EVER. 
     Addiction is the inability to stop. If i didn't watch what my mother and grandfather went through it would've been a lot tougher for me to quit. It may have been that easy for others but i was addicted and it wasn't for me. Seeing the ending motivated my quit.        
    All we have is choice.  Choose well.    I choose to not indulge my addictions.  That is all.    Choice. Possibly, I have something in my DNA that predicates my addictive behaviour.    I don't care.   I have Choice.  I Choose to be Free.    s

If they want tough love, there's a few they can goto here for that support.

We have different views with the same goal, quitting. When personal shots come in thats when its not good and no support or educating. There's different  model/views for understanding addiction. Old school will tell you just say no and stop it and think people lack willpower. Science will tell you addiction is a disease, and the research is there to support it.
    I didn't have a plan ....I just had desperation....I had more failed quits behind me ....with a plan ....than I care to count .!!!! What did it for me was just plain old fashioned fear,of having limbs amputated .....yep !!!!.....didn't like the idea of having no feet .   Joined a forum to see if anyone out there could help....well ....it did ....    What I have learnt .....you have to be a hundred percent cent in it ....to win it .......
No plan...it went like this; open the purse, fruck not enough money, buy a box of NRT gum to get me through to pay day, in the chemist on payday on the way to the bank, 6 months of NRT gum was the same price as a pack of smokes...said to meself "go orn, let's see how long this can last".... 19 months today since that last smoke, 16 months-ish since the last NRT gum.        Edit: well that ^ was the kind of blade post that really pissed me off in my early quit....I didn't just decide that was it and that was it....it was hard work, but I dug in and gave it a red hot go and chose each day not to smoke and then protected that commitment.  Oh and I did have a plan, but it came about after the fact and it was an exit plan for getting off the NRT.... That NRT exit plan was much needed for me or I would still be chewing. Edited June 28 by notsmokinjo
    I don’t think it hurts to share different experiences and methods on how people have quit. Doesn’t harm anyone and might even give someone who’s struggling to hold their quit a new idea

    So sorry I brought it up, thought it was relevant....
Don't you worry about a thing, Parsley !    It is a great topic and the cream will rise to the top in the thread.       Some people are planners and successful with their plans.   I am not a planner and have a successful quit running.  I think making the choice to quit, committing to your quit and educating yourself about addiction are essential.    To plan or to quit spontaneously makes no matter,  just a personal choice.Edited June 29 by Sazerac

    There is more than one road to Rome .....just get yourself there....
I kind of had a plan.  Took 2 weeks  time off from work while the rest of the family was going to be away.  Plan was to lock myself in the house and get past the initial withdrawal without hurting any of my loved ones.  I had read up and I thought I was prepared.  Didn't work for me.  At the end of 2 weeks, I was back at work and smoking on that Mon.        Angry at myself for having lost the perfect opportunity and weeks of planning,  That was the day I found QSMB and at around lunch hour decided to try again.  No plan this time.  And it worked - the difference was the online support of folks who had  been through the same journey and could connect in ways the medical sites couldn't.       It's probably different for everyone but there is a right way for each of us.  Sometimes it takes multiple attempts to find it.  I'd say the trick is to keep trying even if there are bumps along the way.
here is an interesting vid  and text on this issue from our friend, Joel.       Conventional wisdom in smoking cessation circles says that people should make plans and preparations for some unspecified future time to quit.  Most people think that when others quit smoking that they must have put a lot of time into preparations and planning,   setting quit dates and following stringent protocols until the magic day arrives.   When it comes down to it, this kind of action plan is rarely seen in real world quitters.   I emphasize the term real world quitters as opposed to people quitting in the virtual world of the Internet.    People who seek out and participate in Internet sites do at times spend an inordinate amount of time    reading and planning about their quits before taking the plunge.    Even at our site we see people say they were reading here for weeks or months before finally quitting and joining up.   Although I suspect there are a fair number of people who had already decided to quit right away and searched us out after their quit had begun, and some people who may not have actually decided to quit but who when finding WhyQuit.com  and seeing cigarettes for what they are decided then and there to start their quits.    Getting back to real world experience though,   the best people to talk to when it comes to quitting smoking are those who have successfully quit   and have successfully stayed off for a significant period of time.  These are people who have proven that their technique in quitting was viable considering they have quit and they are still smoke free.  Talk to everyone you know who is off all nicotine for a year or longer and find out how they initially quit smoking.    You will be amazed at the consistency of the answer you get if you perform that little survey.      People are going to pretty much fall into one of three categories of stories.   They are:   People who awoke one day and were suddenly sick and tired of smoking. They tossed them that day and never looked back.  People who get sick. Not smoking sick, meaning some kind of catastrophic smoking induced illness.     Just people who get a cold or a flu and feel miserable. They feel too sick to smoke, they may feel too sick to eat.     They are down with the infection for two or three days, start to get better and then realize that they have a few days down without smoking     and decide to try to keep it going. Again, they never look back and stuck with their new commitment.  People who leave a doctors office who have been given an ultimatum. Quit smoking or drop dead–it’s your choice.   These are people for whom some sort of problem has been identified by their doctors,    who lay out in no uncertain terms that the person’s life is at risk now if they do not quit smoking.      All of these stories share one thing in common — the technique that people use to quit. They simply quit smoking one day.   The reasons they quit varied but the technique they used was basically the same.    If you examine each of the three scenarios you will also see that none of them lend themselves to long-term planning    — they are spur of the moment decisions elicited by some external circumstance.     I really do encourage all people to do this survey, talking to long- term ex-smokers in their real world,   people who they knew when they were smokers, who they knew when they quit and who they still know as ex- smokers.   The more people do this the more obvious it will become how people quit smoking and how people stay off of smoking. Again, people quit smoking by simply quitting smoking and people stay off of smoking    by simply knowing that to stay smoke free that they must Never Take Another Puff!   Joel        © Joel Spitzer 2006     The British Medical Journal reported an interesting study that tied into this article very well. Here is a link to the study:http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7539/458    I wrote a reply to the Journal that was posted on its response website. Here is a link to that reply:http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/31/setting-quit-dates    That commentary elicited a reply from another person, who was basically trying to give the impression   that serious scientists shouldn’t put too much emphasis on real world experiences.  I wrote a reply to this editorial but it somehow did not seem to get past the editorial review board at the British Medical Journal.    I think the reply is still valid so I am attaching it below:    Re: Flawed reasoning    Joel Spitzer,   Health Educator Conduct Stop Smoking Clinics for the Evanston and the Skokie Illinois Health Departments 60201,60076    Send response to journal: Re: Flawed reasoning          “…because something commonly happens in a particular way ‘in the real world’ then this should be considered the best way.   ” Smoking cessation experts often seem to have to be telling people to dismiss real world experiences.  Usually I see a little different variation of the comment above.    Common statements I have seen are something to the effects that while it is likely  that a person may at times encounter real world quitters who succeeded by using non-recommended techniques, usually meaning no pharmaceutical intervention or in what this study is showing, people who used no set quitting date,  that these people are just the exceptional cases.   What the experts are trying to do in effect is discredit observations made by people,   making them think that the occurrence of such experiences are really rare.  The author above was at least accurate enough to say,   “While it is true that most smokers who quit do so without any specific behavioral support or pharmacological treatment…”   The rest of the comment was going on to try to give the impression that there would have been even more successful quitters if people would just do what smoking cessation experts say should work as opposed to doing what actual quitters continually say has worked for them.    The tactic being employed here is to leave the impression that we could just have a whole lot more successful quitters  if people would just utilize the miraculous effective products out there that actually help people to quit. There is also the perception being portrayed that there really are very few ex-smokers out there    because most who have tried to quit have done so unaided    and everyone just knows how improbable it is for people to be able to quit in an unaided attempt.   Medical professionals and the general public are being misled to believe that quitting smoking is just too plain difficult for people to do on their own    and that the odds of a person actually quitting on their own is really pretty dismal.   This would all make perfect sense if not for the fact that we have so many successful ex-smokers in the real world. In America, we have more former smokers than current smokers.   Over half of the people who used to smoke have now quit smoking.    From the comment made above it should be clear to all that most of the people who have quit either did not know of professional recommendations for quitting or chose to ignore professional intervention techniques.   Yet these people successfully quit anyway.  I think that this is an important point to hit home with all medical professionals. The medical profession has got to start to help people to realize the real potential of success that individuals do have to quit smoking instead of perpetuating the idea that quitting is just too hard for an individual smoker to expect to actually succeed without help.   While this article should have been about planning techniques,  the original author and a few experts weighing in on the discussion have tried to turn it into a referendum on selling pharmaceutical interventions. Nicotine replacement products have been around for over two decades now–   and a significant percentage of smokers have used them to try to quit smoking.  If a product has been around for decades, used by millions of people worldwide, AND, has been truly effective, it should be easy for most health care practitioners to come up with lots and lots of successful patients, colleagues, family members and friends who have quit with these products. As I said in my original commentary above:  ” I don’t believe that there is a single professional smoking cessation “plan your quit” advocate   who will suggest other medical professionals should take a similar survey.  For if they did their study results would almost certainly be called into question when the health care professional starts seeing the results of his or her real life survey.  The experts will end up having to spend quite a bit of time trying to explain away the discrepancy, using rationalizations  like the people who planned their quit “didn’t do it right” or didn’t “plan” long enough or were “just more addicted smokers.”  In all honesty, I don’t expect my encouraging of real world observations by health care professionals   to have much impact with smoking cessation experts. They are going to profess to believe whatever other experts keep telling them to believe or, what the funders of their studies believe. I do however believe that health care workers who are on the front line and actually deal with patients who smoke are going to be a bit more critical and analytical about this.    If they spend any time talking with patients they are going to see through the rhetoric and the rationalizations of the experts.    I have always tried to disseminate the message that just because something works in the lab or in study conditions  doesn’t necessarily translate to the fact that the process will work in the real world. The smoking cessation experts seem to have to work on the basis that just because something works in the real world doesn’t mean that it is a good approach if it doesn’t seem to work in a lab.    I have high hopes that medical professionals really wanting to help their patients  are going to be more influenced by what they see is successful than by being told by the experts what should be successful, but somehow not replicable in their own practices.      Also related:“I will quit when”
     @Sazerac Now that you mention it, I remember seeing this video. Its a great video. However, in a way, it made me doubt if I plan my quit, I will be successful. But I had to plan, at least for the juice (since the juice I wanted may have not been easily available at the local store). Besides, I like to be mentally prepared when undertaking something new. Again, what works for one person may/may not work for another. So like I said, to each his/her own.

Joel gets this shit all the time. It is ridiculous.

But he does, since he's dealt with so many people (through his clinics or online) who have quit smoking, he has a lot of insight and experience (without being a smoker).
@Sazerac To clarify - I'm not against Joel in any way. In fact, it was his videos inspired me to go cold turkey, and I'm grateful for his videos. I did say it was a great video. Also, I do think, since he makes the videos, they will all have his own words. I didn't mean that in any negative way.

Why do we expect the people that are the best qualified to give us advice to be ex-smokers? Yeah, personal experience is second to none. But is it necessary? Just like you pointed out you don’t have to be a psychopath to become a good psychiatrist.        Maybe we should just focus on wise words as opposed to who said them.
    I didn't think you were disparaging Joel, Ankush.   You were very clear which was v. appreciated.   I was responding to the other poster.       Again, sorry for the mixup, @Ankush !   We have to stop meeting like this, lol.

@Ankush, you are SO right.  Thank you for the reminder.  I appreciate it.
@Ankush Plan or no plan, there is no one way. Whatever works , some of gave you our success and both ways. A plan works
@Whispers   lol.  nobody would ever hire me as a moderator.  funny.     I am a proponent of cold turkey only because cold turkey is my experience   and I know that you don't need a plan to quit   because I quit, almost six years ago on a whim.     Over these years I have supported ALL kinds of quits,   I believe the community will back me up on this.    How one quits, matters not. ALL quits are good quits.       Please, there is no reason for your vitriol towards me or, Joel or, anybody here.   This is a kind and supportive place where we may have different views or techniques in conquering our addiction,    but, at the end of the day, we are on the same side.        Here is MQ's post on the subject of Joel Spitzer     MarylandQuitterBy endurance we conquerAdministrators Posted January 27, 2018    Joel ASKED me if he could join up and cautioned me that his presence could cause some discord.  He then asked me how much I wanted him to post to which I told him he could post as often as he would like to.  After all, when you Google how to quit smoking (or related searches) Joel's materials are always at the top of search results so why not allow (not that he ever needed my permission) him to post here?  It would be insane not to, as his materials have helped masses of people from all over the world quit smoking.    The notion that his materials are insignificant or somehow illegitimate because he never smoked is preposterous.  The psychiatrist who successfully treats patients doesn't have the prerequisite to have had the same disorder in which he/she is treating in order to see results.  He or she only has to have empathy, experience, knowledge and most importantly, the data which shows efficacy of treatments.  Through the many clinics that Joel ran through the American Cancer Society and on his own,he gained a vast and invaluable collection of data which came directly from smokers over the course of decades. He, like the Dr. helping a person cope with the devastation caused by a divorce, losing a job, a spouse or a child does not have to have experienced the same to help the patient.  You know who spoke truth to me about my drug addiction to nicotine?  My Dr.  He never smoked a day in his life yet he knew about this addiction and what it would take for me to quit. He steered me to a place to get help which led me to Joel's materials.     Lastly, those who mentioned that his posts were spam ought to be ashamed of yourselves.  Spam is profit driven or driven for some other nefarious purpose.  Joel has never made a dime from any of his materials. His time spent here behind the scenes before he ever joined was free.  He has a desire to help people quit smoking and stay quit.  He's never asked for anything and to assume that he posts to drive people to YouTube or elsewhere is bananas.  Do you not realize that ALL of Joel's videos were posted on this site long before he ever joined??  If click bait were the case, he would have never allowed me to do this.  He encourages anybody to use his materials with the goal of helping people save their lives.  Talking about inflicting bodily harm to Joel because of efforts is very telling of where some people are at.     Should it get asked, QT is funded solely by me; always has and always will be.  Nothing on this site came to me as free as I have to retain programmers, designers, pay for licensing of the software etc.  Moreoever, QuitTrain is a Registered Trademark which was also not free, but imperative to the longevity of something that myself and few others created (the Moderators) and what was created is protected.  I allow no advertisements and don't take donations etc., even though I've been asked to.  Hell, I don't even allow Facebook logins because in case you didn't know, when sites allow this,they gain access to your friend list and can send adverts etc. to which I want NO PART OF. I share the same desire as Joel and my moderators to freely give time and money to help ANYBODY quit smoking and stay quit.  To this, you do not have the right to make false accusations regarding the motives of those who take their time and moneyto help complete strangers save their lives by quitting this deadly addiction.  Joel will not be posting here and that is his choice. However, he will still be in daily or weekly contact with me as he has for several years now.  He has lots to offer and ways to help and I am always grateful for this.               Edited July 2 by Sazerac
    I'm a former smoker who successfully quit.  I've also been a member of this forum for over three years now.  As Yogi Berra said: "You can observe a lot by just watching."      In my time here, I've developed a thesis...feels like I just might have cracked the code.       What if I told you there was one secret that every successful quitter used to set themselves free from cigarettes...        Ready for it?  This is groundbreaking stuff right here...Every quitter who has enjoyed a successful quit committed to stop putting cigarettes in their mouth and setting them on fire.      Some made a plan; some quit on an impulse.  Some went cold turkey while others used NRT and still others used Chantix/Champix.  Some read and did research; others relied on intuition.     The one unifying common thread in every successful quit comes back to the decision that was made to not put a cigarette in your mouth and light it on fire.  Everything else is supplementary to the one big decision(the aforementioned rule of not putting a cigarette in your mouth and lighting it on fire).        Quitting smoking is not judged like an Olympic diving meet, you don't get bonus points for making things more difficult.        Don't lose sight of the big picture and keep it simple.

Bhutan, one the least developed nations in South East Asia is the first country in the world to ban tobacco sales. So this isn't news, they did it in 2010.     Bhutan banned the sale of tobacco in 2010 but tightened up its law further last year to combat smuggling, requiring consumers to provide valid customs receipts for their cigarettes or chewi g tobacco, which is more common.  In March this year a monk caught carrying $2.50-worth of tobacco was jailed for three years, becoming the first person punished under the country's antismoking law.        So are these laws too draconian?        Could they work in a country with a population over 1million?       Should we all just follow suit?     A part of me wants to stand applaud them... But part of me wonders if it isn't too far.
Some may argue that all drugs should be legal (as they are in Portugal). You can't control what people want to consume and what they don't. The government should rather educate and give the power to the people to choose what they want to consume, using unbiased knowledge as a tool. Also, knowledge shouldn't be used deceptively to advance some harmful propaganda, if at all. Then again, Nicotine is one such drug, that shouldn't even exist as a drug for consumption, but that's just my opinion. So, like you, I'm divided on whether Bhutan did the right thing or not.Edited July 1 by Ankush

Here is an interesting articleFROM CRUELTY TO CARE: DRUG POLICY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION.   and another one  DRUG DECRIMINALISATION IN PORTUGAL: SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
    I am also on the fence on this one.  Could it be too far or should we be leaving the choice to the individual.  We could then use other means as education, financial, and not promoting in advertising to apply pressure.  There is individual choice but how far should government go!!!!
@Sazerac Until very recently, I was ignorant that Portugal had decriminalized drugs. My brother had brought this to my attention. My initial reaction was, then all citizens will become drug addicts. However, while this was true to a large extent during the initial years of decriminalization in Portugal, the numbers of drug abuse eventually dropped, which is shown in the article as well. Since I was a pot user for different periods in my life (2006-sometime in the beginning of 2007, sometime in 2010-sometime in 2013, sometime in 2014-July 2017), so a long time (approx 8 years), my stance for pot was that it should be legalized. However, my stance on hard drugs was that they should continue to be illegal. Maybe I was a bit partial towards pot (since I was its user), I don't know.        I gave some thought about what Portugal had done with decriminalization and eventually reached the conclusion I mentioned earlier in the thread.Edited July 1 by Ankush
    Thanks for you thoughts, @Ankush.   I believe in across the board decriminalization.    However, I would love to see Big Tobacco/Big Pharma, cartels and governments be held truly accountable for their lies.

Yes, and while there are plenty of scientific studies already on various drugs, I think further studies are required on drugs such as pot by an unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial medical body. The verdict on a drug like Nicotine is already out. Across the board decriminalization will be good. Also, environment plays a role on drug (legal or illegal) use. So, governments and all those responsible should really ask themselves, are they creating an environment where drug use is encouraged or not. There is also the fact that everybody enjoys dopamine release, and since drugs are quick way for dopamine release, I think everybody likes to get high (the extent and method used varies).
So came across this today when I fell into a Google hole. There are some very interesting points raised here... And saddly I believed many of these before educating myself ....used quite a few to justify my smoking.  https://blogs.bmj.com/tc/2016/03/23/20-myths-about-smoking-that-will-not-die/
I, along with many, believed that smoking chilled me out    and would reach for a smoke to calm me down.    It was a colossal revelation when I learned that I was only relieving the anxiety caused by low nicotine levels !Edited June 30 by Sazerac
    Yep...I 'needed' to smoke to control my anxiety....can honestly say my anxiety is better as a non smoker. Smoking just amplified my anxiety.        I had given up everything else, so it was the only thing I had left....oh and biggest myth I told myself, it was better for the kid if I kept smoking because I would be too agro trying to quit to be a good mum.       
    I won't be 'Me' without smoking was another huge myth.      Although I was enamored of my smoking persona and defiant with denial,  these were only by-products of my addiction.        When I learned the truth about addiction,  my idiocy was revealed.   
    Reading this was an eye opener on a couple of the points and I actually bought into a couple of them when I was a smoker.  I am kind of ashamed to admit that when I was younger I kind of fell into the "we all have to die of something" myth so why not smoking -- some of the stupid things that I did.  Anyway I have quit and my eyes are opened to what smoking really does -- help keeps me grounded!!!

Have to say one where Big Tobacco tried to convince countries to get their people to smoke because it was in the national interest....this was in the 90s...that's 1990s....scraping the barrels of scum there.
    I also thought I wouldn't be "me" if I quit smoking. Totally resonate with thinking I would somehow lose my identity if I stopped -  what a load of BS that turned out to be!! I was also under the majorly false impression that it relieved stress - the actual truth is it caused stress for me. I was always worrying if I have enough cigarettes/if there's somewhere I can buy some more/what if I run out/when can I have my next fix and the list goes on and on and on. I am not someone who is prone to being stressed easily and cigarettes have actually been the only bloody thing that have consistently ever stressed me out.

Want  to quit smoking? Good. That takes some nerve and that alone is enough to get it done. You don't have to be smart, you just need to use the courage and will that you have, in the right way, and get that brain of yours aligned to make it happen. Just quit. Do it now. There, you just quit. It's that easy. Now you are craving a smoke of course. It gets better, just as soon as you set your mind to being a non smoker and you free yourself from yourself, and from how you choose to live your life. This place cannot help you quit, it can't give you a quit, and it can't keep you quit. Only you can do that, and it's a choice. Either smoke. Or quit. The only thing that can happen to you here is to get encouragement and support. All that people here can do for you is to tell you how and to promise you that it can be done.You are absolutely going to have to hold yourself accountable and commit to staying quit, all on your own. This place can be effective in teaching you how to start walking after you've been crawling (quit) on your own, if you use it the right way. Understand that you are an addict first, and that's why you smoke because smoking is your answer to everything. If you are quitting you should realize that smoking is the answer to nothing.  This also includes the journey ahead of you. A cigarette will never be the answer to anything you need.
I love this post, this part especially. "A cigarette will never be the answer to anything you need" I'm going to put that in my signature so it can serve as a reminder.

When our quits are young, we must learn and then practice in a conscious manner, to disconnect and keep separate our quits from all life events. We learn to always keep our quits sacred, protected, and never influenced by any life event that may happen. This dynamic we may call The Proper Sequence, and it is powered by your commitment to Never.Take.Another.Puff. (NTAP).It does not matter what may happen on any day in your life......as long as you maintain in a conscious manner The Proper Sequence dynamic as a primary element of your quit, you will not smoke.The Proper Sequence is:YOU --> QUIT --> LIFE.•NOT•:YOU --> LIFE --> QUIT.By maintaining this simple sequence dynamic in your quit, you will not ever have your quit influenced by life events. If you always keep your quit close to you, protecting it with your commitment to Never.Take.Another.Puff (NTAP), you will never, *EVER*, smoke again. We build our quits, and train our minds, our emotions, and our spirits to live as non-smokers in beautiful freedom by continuing to commit to NTAP. as our way of not smoking, and our way of slowly putting this awful addiction to sleep.Consciously adding The Proper Sequence dynamic to your new non-smoker identity will strengthen your quit even more.  Cristóbal (Posted on Day 364)
I love that!! So simple but profound I'm going to use that as my signature :)
This is a blue print for success. Even though you can live  his life as a new quitter and enjoy your new  freedom, you can also   be careful in places and at times where you know you may be vulnerable.  For example, taking time to see how you feel as a nonsmoker when having a drink or two before drinking a lot , or being aware of  trigger times, such as a family dinner or after a hard day. I like how Cris says we build our quits over time, which is SO true to me, growing stinger as time goes on an d new habits are made.

https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/smoking-in-restaurants-airport-may-soon-be-banned-in-atlanta/961799213             Wow, its been over 25 years that you cant smoke in restaurants and bars out here.  About time they did this
    The Atlanta City Council is late to the party on this one.  Every restaurant and bar I can think of in the A-T-L has been smoke-free for years.  Some had outdoor areas where smoking was permitted, but it's been years since any of those places had a smoking area inside the establishment.     Bars and restaurants had to make a business decision.  With smoking on a dramatic decline, going smoke-free was the right choice.
    Yea smoking in any establishment here, except the Indian casinos, has been banned for years. I thought I would hate not being able to smoke in bars when it first took effect but I was surprisingly glad they did. I never was one to smoke in restaurants so I was really happy to see that banned     
Every year i goto see the Falcons play at least 1x, i havnt seen a bar you can smoke in by that area but this news i was like Wow. They have underground bars in NY that allow it but on the DL.

They have underground bars in NY that allow it but on the DL.                The only place I have been in Atlanta that may still have a smoking section is a billiards club that has a walk-in humidor and sells cigars.  Even that joint had clearly defined smoking and non-smoking areas.        Even most of the strip clubs in Atlanta went smoke-free several years ago.  And no...it's not important how I know that.
For the sake of consistency, I'd love to see challenges to this (obviously smart and beneficial) policy by the folks on this site who love to claim that ALL limits to freedom (and the commercial tobacco industry/lobby has done a masterful job of convincing people that smoking is a form of freedom) are somehow dangerous and un-american.       Way to go Atlanta.          Christian99 17 1/2 Years Quit
    One cannot legislate addiction.     Addiction remains addiction,        Wanna talk about caffeine ? I have managed to give up all the 'eines' available.    Gives me a shit load of compassion.     I believe in information and personal choice... and have as much fun as you can in this mean old, cruel, old world. S
So (and this applies to vaping too where you see a (V)) all these are over a decade old, some over 2.....these are law...with on the spot fines...and @garry mhudson    ya see (L) they were tested in court and the laws were upheld. (Victoria, Australia)        1. (L) ... Littering with an unlit butt ...$345 2. (L) Littering with a lit butt ....$500   ** $650 on any but from a vehicle window (car)....and anyone can go to the website to do you in and there less than 1% successful challenge rate. Oh and if ya do it on a total fire ban day, triple the fine.  3. (V & L)... Smoking in a vehicle with a passenger 16 years or younger....if a passenger in the car is smoking/vaping then both the passenger and the driver get fined. If 2 passengers are smoking the driver gets a fine for each of them. Currently $350 a pop. *Don't forget it's illegal to sell vapes in Aus with nicotine, it's illegal to advertise, illegal to sell to U18, individuals can import 6weeks nicotine supplies from overseas.    4. (V) ... $500 fine for within 10m of a school fence....even on a non school day   5. (V, L) ... $500 fine within 10m of an U18 sporting event or kids park (playground)   6. (V,L) .... $250, for within 5m of the door of any public building, in an alfresco dining area/beer garden, 10m of any government buildings door (hospitals, etc), train stations, bus stops.     We might live our lives upside down....but maybe it ain't such a wrong way to be...and then again considering we are just a glorified former prison, maybe we are just not used to civil liberties       Edited June 29 by notsmokinjo
I bought 2 cigarettes too , But then i took a bath , felt fresh ,killed the dullness and threw away the 2 cigarettes too .      Somehow survived a very very dull day without smoking
    Good job sticking to your quit.  I am glad you had the power to throw them out.  Cigarettes do nothing to serve you! 
Move a Muscle, change a thought...          I have been in the same place and actually done the same(got a couple ciggs), when i didnt smoke and beat the crave the feeling of victory was so good. Going for walks was a big thing for me (move a muscle , change a thought) . The crave will pass and dealing with the situations get better and better. Good job @Sunshine59, remember this next time for some help
Great Job sunshine59, whatever you can do to get rid of the craving.  As Whispers states -- take a walk that always helps me.  I have had thoughts of getting a pack but always look at where I am at and the overall improvements, if it gets drastic I pull out the plastic cigarette I have and suck in straight air and it seems to do the trick.  You have this and doing well!!!!
Good job throwing them out sunshine, you should be super proud of yourself!  And like @Martian5 I pulled out my air cigarette when craves got too drastic and it did he trick every time
    I had a craving as well...      For a cheeseburger and fries.    Don't think I need to tell you how that ended up. 
    I'm glad you successfully fought through that, Sunshine.  I read that you got two cigarettes and I feared the worst.  I'm glad you threw them away without lighting up..        Good job.  If you ever get to this point again, though, please reach out for help here before even buying the cigarettes.  That is too close.
    Thanks for all the replies ,    That was very close , because i don't usually buy cigarettes even when i have cravings . This time i bought cigarettes , but i was able to throw it away just in time  before i lighted it up .

Hey you 2018 Excigcutioners and 2019 Ashkickers, how are you doing? You should all be so proud of yourselves Edited May 23 by jillar
    Thanks for looking out for us Jillar.       I feel I've turned a corner in the last few days. I'm feeling much happier in myself and I'm not just sitting around waiting to cross another day off the calendar.         I still think about smoking a lot but I'm finally feeling proud that I've kept going     
    I used to be a newbie. Does that count?
There was period of few days in the last couple of weeks when I didn't think of having a cigarette at all. Then that happy period went away and I find myself thinking of having a cigarette everyday again. Then I remind myself not to give into the crave. Its disappointing that my crave for a cigarette doesn't last for just 3 to 5 minutes, it lasts much longer than that. Just waiting for the day when I will stop thinking of cigarettes altogether. I don't know when that day will come though.

One of the rewards I have received from my quit is being able to jog in place for longer than 2 and half minutes. Exercising in general has also become a bit easier. I do run out of breath but I recover faster than I used to when I was a smoker. Every time I think of a cigarette, I just refuse to submit to it (even though sometimes during a crave I think "Eff it, I am going to buy a cigarette" but then I prevent myself from making that blunder) and remind myself how much more difficult exercising would be if I was a smoker.       1 hour ago, Linda Thomas said:              I am very proud to be smoke free.  I will protect my quit with every ounce of my being.  Ten months ago, this was a longing that I never thought I could achieve.           @Linda Thomas I am happy that you have achieved a 10 month quit

So, that's another way I fight the crave (besides accepting that I want a cigarette, refusing to submit to the crave; and concentrating on the rewards)...
    I would  like to say something.....I'm here at work and a thought(not a craving) came across my mind to smoke.  I didn't entertain it! I didn't fantasize about it!! I HAD to dismiss it immediately!!!! Not allowing that thought to take root!!! Try it @Ankush I know I'm a newbie but we are here to encourage and support each other.  My quote is I do WHATEVER, HOWEVER, WHENEVER, TO NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF
    You have the correct outlook Ankush.  Focus on the good things you are seeing and have yet to see. That will help get you through. It's early days still Ankush. It just takes time so be patient. The magic will happen.

It also seems like forever since I quit smoking, but I realize its just no man's land (since its been more than a month since I quit). I did read the post about no man's land some days ago...
@Ankush, those constant thoughts of cigarettes on a daily basis was the worst part of the early quit for me and probably many others but just wait until the day comes, and it will, that you wake up feeling great and halfway through your day you realize you haven't thought about it one time. It's such a great feeling and it will come for you too, I promise 
    Let's see.... I can have a thought about a smoke, but it remains just that, a thought.  A craving to me is every fiber of my being is involved. I want to smoke it, hold it, watch the smoke drift in the air. smell it (ALL OF IT AND SOME )
    Be encourage @Ankush it isn't always easy for me.  I have to FIGHT to keep this.

I used smoking as an escape from having to face problems that came along in my daily life.

I don't get the same feeling just sitting in a corner without the smoke.        Our quits are still very young so we're still battling through each day.

Hey Newbies! There's a Pinned Thread on the Quit Smoking Discussion Page called The 1 Year Commitment. There's a reason for that pledge. There are seasonal challenges that we face depending on the climate we live in or even our religious beliefs and celebrations. We were conditioned to smoking when certain things happened with celebrations or changing of seasons. You must face these times now as a non smoker to become comfortable with no longer smoking in those situations.   It's not because you will be having major cravings all the time. That tends to settle down within the first 4-7 months depending on the person. You WILL come to a point when you just suddenly realize that you never want to smoke again. That is a magical moment. It happens to all who adhere to the NOPE pledge for long enough. This doesn't mean you will never think about smoking again. It just means you will have a different reaction to those thoughts when they occur. That's when you KNOW you've arrived at your forever quit!Edited May 24 by reciprocity

As soon as a problem came along I would throw a big hissy fit and head outside to chain smoke. When that guy pissed me off at work I came here and talked about it on my thread and when I got upset about NRT I wrote an SOS.  I talked and people here helped me and I got past it. I actually dealt with my feelings rather than smoke.       Don't get too excited guys. Not smoking won't change me from being an over opinionated, volatile, self righteous dick lol.

    Check in time! How's everyone doing? 
You guys are stuck with me.  I am still here.
    Sticking to my quit
Yep, I am a dumb ass. I gave in. I never posted in SOS because I am not good at asking for help until the shit has actually hit the fan.        Maybe it was because of a particularly long week at work. Maybe it was the weather. Some new neighbors moved in who happen to pretty much live on the front porch. I hate people, so that means hoping to not be bothered when I have to do yard work in the front. I am sure I could come up with a good excuse.       Anyways Tuesday the 23rd, I had been having some serious craves for a week straight. Nothing real big triggered it, just came out of nowhere. So I bought a pack of my favorite smokes and have smoked three of them, one a day. A few puffs here and there, like my final days of smoking before my last quit. It helps that I do not carry my cigarettes when out and about or at work.   What was I thinking? - "OK, why am I depriving myself of something I enjoyed?"      My craves over the last week before Tuesday were roughly as bad as the first three days of quitting.    So, how can craves return full force after several months or over a year? Yeah I had craves as bad before but it was still when I was pumped about quitting.        After smoking again, I felt relaxed but really stupid, maybe the same feeling as if you lost your temper for a second and smashed one of your car windows just out of anger. Then you think, "Well, that was dumb, I broke it, couldn't control it..."      I guess the answer is to throw away the pack and "just not smoke". Apparently it is not that easy. Hell no it ain't.    I need and want to stay quit for me. I do not want to end up like some of the stories I have read here where it takes some horrible medical problem before I quit. I want to do this while I am ahead.  I do not care so much what "society" thinks of my smoking. I want to lay off for ME.        I though by now, I had this. Like craves were a thing of the past. But I guess not. When the hell then do they vanish? Two years? Ten? Never? At least now I understand how someone can quit for years and then go back.        So, when I do put them back down, does that mean another "hell week"? What should I expect?Edited April 26 by Jet Black
I will be honest, it is hard to see this.  Yep I am going to say get rid of what you have now, do not take another puff (that will help stop, hopefully going thru another hell week if you are being honest about what you have smoked).  We all make mistakes but it is what we learn from them that is important, take a deep look at the last couple of weeks to see if you can find the trigger.  If I am being honest yes I still get a strong craving especially that last month or so do to family and some medical stress and really fought to stay away from smoking.  Quitting can a never ending process -- time just gives us many more ways of coping with the craves and realizing we do not need to smoke -- that life is better on the other end.  What can you expect -- More of My Support as you move forward without smoking.  You do not want to be like me and others where quitting became a medically important for my health -- you can do this!!!!!      And remember the SOS board is there for all of us!!!!Edited April 26 by Martian5
    Oh, Jet Black, I am so very sorry to read this.  Regarding craves, how long do they last?  I don't really know the answer to that question and actually don't even think craves had anything to do with my relapse last year.  I'm still trying to figure it out; I guess it was complacency?  But I'm going to say that, as addicts, we can probably have craves after any length of time.  It's just that as time passes, the craves should become fewer and more easily managed.     Where do you go from here?  The sooner you quit again, the easier it will be.  If you quit now, I doubt that you will have a "hell week" per se but you will likely feel the pull of nicotine that was reintroduced into your system.  We're all so different, it's hard to say.  Just don't let it go months and months like I did.  Then it is basically quitting from scratch again.     Best wishes to you that you fix this mistake as soon as possible!
    ^^^^^^ Yes I believe Mona hit one aspect and that is complacency -- we will always have to be on guard since craves can and do come out of nowhere!!!!

@Jet Black ,        Once you are a smoker , that tendency to smoke may remain for the rest of the lives .   This is what i have learned from my past experiences .  Only the intensity of the craving keeps changing .      There are times when you have no cravings at all    Sometimes you have a strong craving , You have to somehow fight it off  Sometimes you have a very light craving , You still have to fight it off .      You should have tried everything else other than smoking .           Edited April 27 by Redemption3

    So Now What ??  A good question ...only you can answer .... You can carry on smoking and risk your health every day ...trying to dodge that bullet ..or ... You can just throw the cancer sticks away ...sit back down in your chair and start again .....your choice....   The SOS thread is there for a good reason ...we carnt help if you don't give us a chance ...    I could have got the frying pan out ..  I'm disappointed for you ...     
    Shit JB, sorry to hear that.        Give yourself a firm kick in the butt and get back on track. You had one of the best reasons for quitting Ive read here so far: you want to be able to laugh without choking (and something with 'retard' but I dont know the exact context when you said that so nevermind).       Oh and, please let me know when you "decide" to become a smoker again, ill send you one of these awfull Nickelback cigaret boxes!       Hey, this is not what you want. Quit it.
Well JB, I would get right back on the train.  Throwing away a 1-1/2 year quit is disappointing.  Those cigarettes may taste good and feel good to smoke but you know that is just the junkie thinking part.  Concentrate on the reason you quit.   I am glad you posted and hope we can, once again,  help guide you to freedom.
    Jet I am so new here but am so sorry about you losing your quit. All I can tell you is to just commit to not smoking anymore. I am however, greatful that you are here posting your experience. I learn from them. I am cheering you on. We can beat this. 
Now what?  You have a decision to make.     Do you really want to be a smoker again?        Is the occasional hit of nicotine worth the cost and sacrifice?     Only you can answer these questions for yourself.           On 4/26/2019 at 6:03 PM, Jet Black said:                I guess the answer is to throw away the pack and "just not smoke". Apparently it is not that easy. Hell no it ain't.                "Easy" is a relative term.      However, just not smoking is the cardinal rule of quitting.  It's a simple principle.  It's also the only principle that really matters in a quit.
    Over three days, I smoked six of the cancer sticks. Each time, Something interesting happened - head rush, guilt, feeling sick, having horrid taste in mouth, being able to smell myself, thinking about how smoking is a fire hazard...        So last night I gave the rest of the pack to my room mate and said, "crumble these". She has never experienced tobacco nor nicotine so nit like she would pick up the habit.    I just decided that smoking wasn't worth the BS.        The worst part is feeling guilty. I seldom feel guilt but damn, that was horrid.        So if anyone else sees this and is thinking, "screw it, I want to smoke". It really is not worth it. It is kind of the same guilt you might feel if you got mad an broke something expensive.

Thank you JB for this honest post ....it just may help that one person who is still romancing !!!just One !!!!  I'm happy you got back in to your seat ,before it went cold ... Learn by this mistake ,and remember it .....
    I guess it was Friday night/Saturday morning when I had my room mate destroy the remains of the pack.   Weird but I haven't really wanted one since. Feeling my lungs burn when I smoked the last one kind of put a stop to THAT desire.        One thing, I had someone on this board I had become good friends with (even if but e-mail pals) but she kept relapsing and ran into some kind of pretty serious health issues.  Maybe the damage was already done, maybe if she had kept the quit, the problem would have lay dormant. It wasn't even lung related but supposedly was connected to smoking.     I forgot to add earlier - when I was in the process of a relapse/slip/whatever, it was like some disgusting, dreadful chore to step out and smoke.   
    Good I am glad you got rid of the rest of the pack and are back on track -- Now keep it that way.  At least you see that it was not all that great to have those few and good that you had a negative outcome (throat/lungs burning) -- maybe that will keep you going.  Welcome back aboard!!!!
    Aw, JB, I'm sad to read this. But I get it. You wanna talk about relapse...read my profile. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt, lit it on fire and smoked it. But that was then. This is now. I have to get on the Quit Train and STAY on. For good. Because I, too, know about serious health issues. Mine are not caused by smoking but rather an autoimmune disease, but my lungs are affected. My body is building up scar tissue in my lungs for no reason at all. And, if I want to live, I need to breathe ONLY clean air for the rest of my life. I can do that. Because I do want to live.     So I'm taking the whole relapse option off the table. It's gone. Will I face cravings? Yes. I'm sure of it. Will I give in? Hell no. What will I do instead? Whatever it takes.     Whatever it takes. That's what we have to do.       I'm glad you're back on the Train. You and your sense of humor have gotten me through some dark days. I would be extremely sad if you weren't here!
    A mistake is only a total waste when we don't learn anything from it.       The addicted mind tries its best to convince us that smoking is a satisfying experience that will calm and soothe.  The reality is: smoking sucks.      Commit this experience to memory and drive on.

I thought pretty much everyone here but Doreen hated me.       Now as far as doing something besides smoking, I can recommend a few other habits (some bad) -      Spending too much time on ebay, staying up all night and sleeping away the day (I work an evening shift), collecting LP's (hipsters are not the only ones who do that), cursing loudly at work when frustrated, eating way too much sugar, hitting the thrift stores to buy more BS one doesn't need, and most important - being a reason forums have moderators.       There is something else I should mention - One of my co-workers is a chewer. Probably since he was a kid. Anyways, he had been quit for 3 1/2 years. I told him I had smoked, and he mentioned he picked up chewing again, like back in November. I said, "I need to stop, I do not want this habit". Then he said something horrifying! He said, "It is like the love of my life. I know it is bad for me, cancerous etc but I cannot quit, like I am married to the habit". Man, I have NO desire to be married again. Especially not to the nico-demon.

1 and a half years of quit and breaking it can be a bit depressing      I am in my 5th month without smoking .      I still get very bored , tired and dull after 7 o clock in the evening ,because i spent a lot of time in the morning studying and preparing my final semester project       Anyway please think positive and start new .You have only smoked a little after 1 and half years without smoking .              Choose to be optimistic, it feels better    Happiness is not something ready made.

    A reminder to all of us....
    Bump !!

Our Nancy asked me to post this from my blog to 'Quit Smoking Discussion'.  Thank you Nancy.     Lifetime of Addiction       I didn't want to hear this but, I am now facing this truth.    Nicotine Addiction doesn't go away.You can put it to sleep. You can even put it into deep deep and deeper sleep for years ! but, it will awaken the moment you take one puff.One Puff.This is for your whole life.  Mind boggling, huh !?    This was the choice you likely didn't even know you were making    all those years ago when you started smoking,   I didn't understand the ramifications for sure. But, it is the truth.You will always need to be cognizant of your addiction even when smoking is a vague memory,    because the moment you take a puff, the moment you take One Bloomin' PUFF,  That's it ! It's all over and your enslavement will begin, again.    What tenacity !    but, you need to understand,    Nicotine is not as tenacious as You and Your Will.You can quit. I know you can. I quit and I am not a special snowflake,    I am a Nicotine Addict, just like you.   I have great resentment about my Nicotine Addiction.   Damn....I didn't know it would be so invasive.  I didn't know it was going to be a lifetime relationship.I am so angry about thisand it is My Own Damn Fault !  But, my anger, it is a good anger.  It is a righteous anger.    It is an anger that will fuel my commitment to NOPE.    Not One Puff EVER.   Copping to the 'forever' part is a cold hard reality of the addiction. At some point, I had to quit fooling myself and accept it.  It isn't just for today.    It must be forever. If it isn't...I will continue to enslave myself.     Some feel their addiction is so strong they cannot quit,This is wrong. You have the power. You always have the power to quit and you always have the power to stay quit.    Make the commitment to NOPE !   As our friend, Sarge, says, 'Easy Peasy'.  Easy ! not complicated ! This is not Rocket Science.     If you make that commitment to NOPE...you will not fail.You Will Not Fail.The simplicity of it ! The Beauty of it !Not One Puff Ever. Do it. You won't regret it.   Love,SEdited January 9 by Sazerac
I have great resentment about my Nicotine Addiction.Damn....I didn't know it would be so invasive.I didn't know it was going to be a lifetime relationship.I am so angry about thisand it is My Own Damn Fault !  Yes, what you said there. Others tried to warn me, I have no idea still why I didn't hear or believe them!! Beautiful piece of writing Sally. xx
Phew....great writing.....I am so sad,I spent 52 years of my life...addicted.to those dam things....And I'm only too happy ,that I'm still around to write this....
I have great resentment about my Nicotine Addiction.Damn....I didn't know it would be so invasive So resentful here too. No one warned me. When my friends and I started smoking there were no "warning" labels.But would it have made a difference if there were warnings then? Probably not, because I picked up the cigs and became a nicotine addict some years later - despite the surgeon generals "warning". If I'm to be resentful now, it should be aimed toward big tobacco and all the LIES! Like Doreen, I'm grateful to be alive to write this. 
I feel the same way.  :)
I have great resentment about cigarette companies.  Fat cat B******d's.  One in 2 smokers die from smoking related illness.  Many people suffer from smoking related disability.

But, it is the truth.               You will always need to be cognizant of your addiction                  even when smoking is a vague memory,                                    because the moment you take a puff,                                 the moment you take One Bloomin' PUFF,                                  That's it !

You can quit. I know you can.                   I quit and I am not a special snowflake,                                    I am a Nicotine Addict, just like you.                                                  I have great resentment about my Nicotine Addiction.

    Awesome...
Thanks for the bump.        Do I resent nicotine addiction. Yes. I do resent that it is legal and many people profited from my addiction (knowingly profited). I have an illness now and think that smoking has done some damage to my body.        I read somewhere that nicotine addiction is like giving a kid a loaded gun at 13 that goes off in their 50's. This statement was said many years before I even started to smoke. They knew what they were doing the tobacco companies and they should have been stopped. Drug dealers, murderers with blood on their hands.
    I don't resent it. I have nothing and nobody to blame but myself. It was known and obvious that cigarettes were harmful when I started and I did it anyway, and I continued in spite of disadvantages, lack of energy and becoming more and more of a social outcast. I've left it behind and I'm trying to turn my life around now. What good will hating myself bring? What good will punishing myself for that one bad decision bring? I put a closure and keep on living, the best I can.

Thats how i test and see how my lungs are/how much damage i did as a smoker... The body does heal, thats for sure but 100%? I'm not so sure about that
My resentment was about the tenacity of addiction. That just friggin  blew my mind when I looked at it.Edited March 8, 2018 by Sazerac

I do consider starting smoking my mistake and I take full responsibility for it, self hatred and constant regret will not magically turn back time but will only make me feel worse.

Arsenic was a leading cause of death at one point and now it isn't. I do think most smokers would tire of going to the drug dealer for their cigarettes. They would tire of hiding it from the cops etc. They would be more concerned about what harmful might be in the tobacco (unregulated) etc. This argument is a little tired. I've heard it before and it never made sense. It seems similar to other arguments I hear that are inflexible and circular.

I've heard it before and it never made sense. It seems similar to other arguments I hear that are inflexible and circular.            People continue on smoking in spite of constant price increases. There are people who buy cigarettes instead of food. There are people who search for butts in public garbage bins. They would go to their dealer no matter what and if their stash is clean or not would be the last thing on their mind. Same as now, when junkies crave drugs they get it, clean or dirty. Yes, some smokers would stop, same as nowadays some quit when cigarettes become more expensive. There’s always a margin.      I believe we are disagreeing because you’re talking pure theory. Let’s assume cigarettes become illegal. There are going to be millions people craving and in that state they’ll be unpredictable. Did you consider the riots and deaths? The money coming to the state budget, no schools, roads, hospitals. When I hear arguments like yours I can’t help but think about panels when people discuss how war is bad, conclude it’s bad and go home happy with how engaged they are. Time and energy spent on that could have been spend on prevention or something that does work.        Tobacco companies do sell harmful products. I don’t deny it and nobody denies it. Because of usage of that product many people lost their lives. However, they don’t lie. Information about illnesses caused by smoking, pictures of black lungs and warnings in forms of obituaries take more space on packages than the brand logo. They give us all on display and still people start and continue smoking. We did start and continue smoking. The first cigarette and the thousands afterwards were our decision, we knew what was it leading to.

@Giveintowin I understand you've chosen a nice soapbox from which to preach your message.  You have to understand that not everyone agrees with you, and not get personally offended when we don't.     I very much agree with @sgt.barney in saying that it is the personal choice of every smoker to smoke, and their consequences to pay as a result of that choice.  The government (wherever you're from) should not intervene in telling the people what they should/should not do (while most governments think this is their cause for existence).
Early in my quit..I blamed the tobacco companies for all the illnesses smoking had brought to me and my hubby,who suffers from end stage emphysema...   I too thought ,how can they be allowed to kill all these folks....I thought the sarge was a crazy bloke..but....    Over 4 years down the line...learning all what i have about addiction and choices..hubby and myself did have a choice... And we did ignore the warnings...  Sarge is just bluntely speaking the truth....I still hate the companies.... That hasn't changed...I just stopped blaming others for my mistakes...  This just my opinion...

Spirit Airlines passenger banned for life after allegedly vaping on flight http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/AACAOg8?ocid=se    This struck me funny.  What people do because of their addiction.  I can't tell you how many times I thought I could sneak into a bathroom and have a cigarette and nobody would notice.    Exhaling into a paper bag.  How silly, everyone know a plastic one would have been better.Edited June 9 by Linda Thomas
    What a dummy lol. I'm surprised that the smoke alarm went off in the bathroom since its vapor! 
    Anything to get their fix, there's a show a A&E about jail and they blow the smoke in the toilet and flush.
    I'm not proud of this, but I would chew some of that nicotine gum when I had to fly.        Still remember being in that awful smoker's lounge in the airport (you remember...the place with the stained gray walls that smelled like the Devil's asshole) chainsmoking and popping pieces of Nicorette before boarding the plane.      Being an addict is no way to live.
    I was as addicted as anyone, but never even considered smoking in an airplane bathroom. I mean, they make it pretty clear that it's not allowed, so that's that. At least for me. I'd either chew nicotine gum or just deal with the cravings.      You can be damn sure the first thing I did was go out and smoke the minute I got off that plane though.      
And then there's this...        Man jailed for nine years and six months for smoking in plane toilet     https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/25/man-jailed-for-nine-years-and-six-months-for-smoking-in-plane-toilet-6663266/

I thought it was just a fine for smoking on a plane. Then I read through and found that it started a fire and put everybody on the plane in danger      On most flights I would just deal with cravings and light up as soon as I could after getting off.  On long 6+ hr flights I would use gumEdited June 12 by Wayne045

    What do prisoners do with baby diapers?!
    I dont think I want to know the answer,?
Well girl prisoners with babies under 2 would be putting them on there sprigs one would think.      When the no smoking laws first came in there were riots. They get patches and gum and stuff.

    That's sad 
    Shit happens man 
    Its very sad but addicts will do anything to get their fix, smoke on a plane in the bathroom use baby diapers i'll give you another. AT my mothers wake it was in between the day and night viewing, i got there early for some alone time and i saw a homeless person in the big ashtray outside taking all the half smoked ciggs. I asked the people working and they said they always do it.
    Yea they do that at the bowling alley here. I found out the hard way when I still bowled and smoked. I never had time to smoke a whole one so I would run out, smoke about half and save it until I had another chance to sneak out. But every time I came out the other half was gone...   Fun fact: the name of our bowling team was The Smoking Bowlers lol. And we won the league that year 
In a couple of days I will be 3 months quit. I am doing my celebration thread now as I am not sure when I will be visiting the forum again as I am moving home.         So I'm clinking my glass and making a little speech.        Firstly I just want to thank ALL of you for supporting me through this quit. I do however want to give enormous thanks to the people who have been with me from the start of this journey. Those of you who found the patience to keep willing me on through so many failed attempts.       Secondly I am pleased to say that I am smoke free and now nicotine free         Until next time - Love you all xxxxxx
    Well done Lilly!        And I hope the move goes smoothly 
    Congratulations Lilly!!! This is good news
    Congratulations Lilly and best of luck with your move!
    Great stuff - well done 
    Congratulations Lilly, I'm really happy for you. Good luck with your move and please don't be a stranger, we still want to see those charms      
    Congratulations Lilly. Taking the additional leap to becoming nicotine free is the crowning achievement to a healthier life of freedom. Great job!
    Congrats, Lilly! Celebrate your achievements which were so hard-fought for by you...and KTQ going as you move back home!     
    Congratulations on your three months, Lilly!    Remember, you are still in the early days and you have a year of triggers to get through. Stay within shouting distance of QTrain and protect your quit WITH YOUR LIFE !    I am so happy for you, enjoy your move and your nicotine free life. S
    Congrats lilly on three months free! Bravo 
Fantastic job on the 3 month mark -- hopefully you find some time to celebrate amongst all the moving!!!!
    Congratulations Lilly!

    Yay! I had an employee years ago who would throw her cigarettes out the window, sometimes ending up in the back window of my car even after telling her many many times not to do that. So finally I told her that if she threw another cigarette out of the window and it caused a fire I was turning her in. After that she FINALLY started using the ashtray!
    They could fly back in and burn the seats and in dry season (happens in PA) could start a fire.
    Yes, they did fly back in many a time 
I had an uncle that smoked and he threw a lit cig out the window as he was driving down the street he lived on (my family lived 2 doors down). It flew into the back seat of the car and smoldered for awhile, I guess....then it burst into flames in the middle of the night! Neighbor called fire department. According to neighbor, the FD said they got there just in time before car blew up! Down at my house, we were all fast asleep and were shocked to see the big mess and the burnt hulk of his car sitting in driveway...and the stench  of it all!
This will all of been covered a 100 times + but I've got a couple of questions for anyone that wouldn't mind spending a couple of mins answering [hi btw]       Been smoking free for about a month ish - I haven't been counting on purpose as it doesn't matter to me how long just staying stopped if you see what I mean? Every time I start counting in the past I've always started again BUT I keep getting bloated and keep breaking wind, mostly at night/early morning and I'm 'hoping' this isn't a permanent thing? If I drink alcohol I absolutely STINK?      I've also lost my voice and sound like Micky Mouse although I went to Docs and he says this is more likely a bug and he's given me anti biotics.        I've been walking, 'trying' to eat healthy etc etc and 'trying' to get blood circulation going again as I can get 'dead feet' while driving - I've been getting depressed also angry too sometimes, well a bit short tempered, the only good thing so far is food - I absolutely love my food atm BUT as I'm trying to be more healthy I can't eat much of it which is annoying too :)   If anyone has any wise words especially about the night time bloating and the flatulence it really would be appreciated, anything really as I feel a bit down and depressed and all that sort of self pity shitty stuff - anyway nice to say hi to anyone out there and much respect
    Welcome FunkyFunJo and congrats on taking back your life  Everything you're dealing with is totally normal and will subside with time. I used my gassy days as payback to a really gassy husband of mine lol. We had the funniest thread on another board about gas that I so wish was here now so you could see just how common it is.The anger and depression are normal too and will also get better with time. If it gets too bad though I'm sure you could speak to your dr about it and maybe get a temporary med to help you past it.As far as eating healthy, that's always good but in the early days of your quit you may find you're craving more sweets and junk food. Go ahead and listen to your body. It knows what it needs to help mend the damage done by smoking.
    Hello Funkyfunjo, glad to have you aboard for this journey.  It is fantastic that you are a month or so in and I get where you are coming from on the exact counting.  As to your questions I did have some bloating in the earlier stages but did not bother me much.  The voice thing not so sure, did/ do have a bit of problem but at this time counting that to allergies, anyway your throat will benefit from quitting -- keep your doctor appraised if it gets worse or you get more concerned  (after I quit because of some throat issues they did do a CAT scan and all came out great).  The blood circulation and the "feet problem" I did have -- what I can say now is that my feet are much better and circulation overall is much better -- this is a continual process as your quit gets longer, you will see many improvements.  There is a lot to read here that will help.  Again great having you along!!!!!!
    I sure found that my sense of smell improved after I quit. Could it possibly be you didn't quite realise how bad your farts smell before?!! Lol I remember coming out the gym all sweaty and thinking ooft a bit whiffy and I'd never thought that as a smoker! 
Thank you for answering, I feel a bit down at the moment and found this site and just thought I'd give it a go, I lost my missus to lung cancer but it didn't stop me, in fact I went worse and ended up smoking 40 a day - spent the last couple of years sad, pathetic and lonely BUT I'm doing my best to rectify the situation.     As for my 'wind problems' I 'think' I only smell really bad after drinking a Beer or 2, it doesn't take much but for some reason alcohol makes my wind issues quite smelly [too much information?]      I am worried about bloating though, I'm staying away from food that has a reputation for these things [like beans] but every evening my belly stretches out and every morning I keep breaking wind until it flattens again, I hope it goes away but it's been a few weeks ish usually though I don't smell bad, I just seem to fill up with 'wind'      a big thank you for answering , I hope you guys are all doing good, it's nice to get some answers and thank you very much for taking the time, I feel a bit rubbish tonight for some reason, up to now I've done OK, just a downer moment sorry if I sound weak, I WILL win this time though as I think at last I want it enough.       you take it easy and thanks again, just something coming back at me helps

Welcome FunkyfunJo and great job on two months smoke free.  This is a great place to ask those questions.  We all have been through the variety of different issues that goes with quitting.    No matter what, quitting is the best thing you can do.  It will give you so much more power and self esteem.    Read as much as you can on the board and post often.  We want to be there to help you on your quit journey.  There is a lot of fun, humor and support here.     There is the daily Nope pledge, which I love doing every day.

That is what we are here for.  Do not go it alone.  There is so much more strength together.    If you continue to be bloated, you might check with your physician.  I do remember going through a period like that.    Depression comes with quitting because you are saying goodbye to something that you thought comforted you.  It was your friend, but in hindsight, it really was you enemy.  I am sure you are also grieving the loss of your partner.   Post as often as you like.  There is always someone around to make you laugh or lift you up.  We want you to have success.
Thanks a lot, when it comes to success I think it's sticking this time and as it stands there's NO WAY I will be smoking again, the 'bloating' I have to admit has been a bit of an annoyance and I'm glad it's not just me, not that I'd wish these things on anyone else   Smoking has been a major factor when it comes to bad things in my life so you would of 'thought' I'd of give it up ages ago but it's one of those mysteries of life the fact that I haven't but this time I am super determined and to be honest I'm glad I have stumbled upon this forum and I plan to keep dropping as you sound like nice folk.  Noticed Linda your 2 dogs in pic, what breed are they? are they yours or just a pic? after my other half passed away I got a border collie who is now my only and best friend, he's a good lad      Thank you everyone for your input, you keep smiling while I keep breaking wind  [hope it's not forever] it's been nice to meet you.

He sneaks up on me though when I least expect it.     Got up to take the dog for a good walk but it's bucketing down today so he'll have to wait, still bloated, still flatulating [is that a word] but at least I've been able to moan about it somewhere, it's appreciated.     For a treat I'm off out today for a bit of retail therapy - time to buy some new clothes - thanks again
    Welcome aboard @FUNKYFUNJO Its probably a good idea to lay off alcohol for at least the first couple of weeks. It may be the reason behind your stomach problems. As Linda mentioned, if these physical problems persist even after a few weeks, get yourself checked thoroughly by a doctor. The stomach does take some time (the amount of time will vary from person to person) to adjust to not smoking. You could be experiencing some acidity issues, but don't take my word for it, go to a doctor who treats gastrointestinal problems. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetable salads along with fresh fruit juice. For more information, go through some of Joel's videos about the early days of a quit. All the best!!!
    Welcome aboard, @FUNKYFUNJO and congratulations on being smoke free for a month-ish.        I can't add much that hasn't already been said.  I do think the gas issues are common with many quitters but they do seem to go away with time, along with other short-term side effects to quitting (like brain-fog, etc).  The long term benefits to quitting are definitely worth the short-term issues.     It is good to have you here.  Stick around, there is a lot of knowledge and support you can get here to help you stay smoke-free for good.
Thanks everyone for your input - I have had a sore throat too and my voice nearly completely went, I sounded like Mickey Mouse so I went to the Doc who said it was nothing to do with quitting, said it was a 'bug' and gave me some antibiotics which seem to be working - the bloating issues continue though, I mentioned that to the Doc too who said to eat plenty of Wholemeal bread and drink loads of Water, pretty much what you guys said     The best thing for me, up to now, is my Asthma has 90% cleared up, it's mainly a self inflicted thing, smoking is so very bad for you in so many ways, I doubt very much I'll start again, for me though it comes along when you least expect, I seem to suddenly get 'down' and my reaction has always been a 'take it out on yourself' kind of thing so I have smoked and smoked some more, I need to be ready, know the signs and be ready - it's like my brains way of getting me to smoke again    Anyway atm I'm feeling OK, todays treat is I'm going to throw caution to the wind and EAT, forget about the bloating for now as the anti bloating diet hasn't done much and I'm loving FOOD, I am not one to put weight on so why not eh        Thanks a lot
    FunkyfunJo, glad you saw your physician and you have found that most of your issues were not quitting smoking related.  You have a good quit going so don't let those smoking thoughts  take over.  That is the addiction talking to you.  Smoking does nothing but ruin the quality of your life.  When you think you are going to give in to those thoughts, post an SOS.  We are here to help you.   I promise things will get better.  Once you rid yourself of this addiction, you gain so much power and self esteem.
Cheers Linda - I do have one question - sounds a bit daft - googled it and haven't found much saying it's a big nono - in 2 minds to even ask really but here goes haha ......      Can you have too many baths ????  I used to take showers all the time but have found taking a bath every evening helps me relax and sleep, I don't have them super hot or anything but I put some smelly aroma stuff in, put on some relaxing music from YouTube and it helps me 'chill out'        I have been doing this every evening for the last couple of weeks, what you think?
    Well I don't know about Linda but I think it sounds very relaxing so go for it  
    Exercise and deep breathing got me through those moments when I felt irritable or let myself get all wound-up during the early days of the quit.  I don't even remember the last time I wanted a cigarette but still use the deep breathing exercises I learned when I quit daily.  Taking a little pause for the cause and breathing intentionally is just a good way to get yourself centered again.      I don't want to make light of the flatulence situation, but I'm not really sure how much worse my farts were when I quit.  Our sense of smell is improving at the same time our digestive system is adjusting.  Not sure if the farts are worse or if they're just magnified by our improved ability to smell things.

Not sure why you think having a daily bath is a problem? Is there something I don't know lol.        I bought really expensive bath products and body lotions like Estée Lauder, gucci etc when I quit. I smelt so good that I wouldn't have wanted to cover that smell with smoke.      I also bought strong washing liquid and softener for my clothes.  Smelling nice was a big part of why I never lit up.        Edited June 10 by Lilly
    Thanks Lilly - that makes me feel a bit better as you hear things like too many baths take the 'oils' out of your skin and being too clean lowers your immune system, also too many baths are supposed to lower a blokes sperm count, not that I think I will be having any more kids anyway     At the moment all this exercise I've started doing leaves me aching, especially my legs and a good soak with a bit of relaxing music and as you say a bit of 'aromatherapy' going on does help, not only my aches and pains but it also helps me relax and get some sleep.  
I love a hot soak in the tub.  I hate showers.  My husband always used to tease me and said it was like soaking in ones dirt.  Now that he is older,  I find him taking many a soak, in the evening to help those sore muscles.     FunkyfunJo, that sounds like a great way to relax from the stresses of quitting.  Wish I had thought of it.  You are doing great.   Wasn't it Tony Randall (the actor) that had a child in his 80's.  A man is never too young to reporduce.

    Actually Boo this is on point.  Well balanced and don't constantly worry -- keep it all in perspective and listen to your body -- then enjoy!!!!

By Associated Press Published Jun 5, 2019 at 5:01 AM | Updated 45 minutes ago   NEWSLETTERS Receive the latest national-international updates in your inbox Email   Privacy policy | More Newsletters   Mario Tama/Getty Images, File   Cigarette packs are on display for sale in a shop April 1, 2009 in New York City.   Beverly Hills has become the first U.S. city to end most tobacco sales. The City Council on Tuesday unanimously voted to snuff out sales of cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products beginning in 2021.  Take a Look Inside 'Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge' at Disneyland The ban covers sales at gas stations and pharmacies as well as convenience and grocery stores. However, it exempts hotels and three plush cigar lounges in the wealthy and glamorous Los Angeles suburb.    The hotel exemption was designed to accommodate tourists, who could have a concierge deliver their smokes — although they'd have to smoke them outside. Gas station owners opposed the measure, saying it unfairly targeted their businesses and might force employee layoffs. Retailers said the ban might shift sales to neighboring communities. The National Association of Tobacco Outlets opposed the measure. The group claims tobacco sellers in the wealthy community might see monthly income fall 25 precent to 45 percent, CNBC reported.
    Wow.  It would be amazing if this could happen.  
    Hopefully the beginning of things to come --- this would be great!!!
    Some will say give the people their choice (and thats their right) but its good to ban it. It will create a black market for those who want it but so much bad from tobacco

    I rather see them increase the cost to some ridiculous amount of money than ban them. Black markets are never good, no matter what the product or service...…….
They'll pay it, they put the cigarette cards in baseball packs years back to attract the kids. I wasnt one that started early with ciggs, i started at 26 but most smoked early. I did smoke pot at 14 but ciggs years later
    This should get the dumbest idea award.     Unless they actually ban smoking then what exactly have they achieved. Smokers will just stock up or drive to get a pack.       It will never stop kids smoking!
Yesterday my husb wanted Chinese food, and while going to get it, I sure got to thinking (no, not about the food… lol) This restaurant is on the opposite end of town from where we live now… when I quit smoking, we lived in that old neighborhood… well, they have the best Chinese food there, so I decided to take the drive yesterday. This is what struck me:  I drove by THE Plaid Pantry and felt the past 5 years kinda slip away for a moment… I remembered my huge struggle and fight within myself one day at that place.  I was around 2 months quit at the time and I really thought I wanted to smoke… so I got in the car and headed to the Plaid Pantry… when I got there, I sat in the parking lot a few minutes, fighting this crave… I then pulled out of the parking lot and spent the next hour literally driving around the block and not being able to decide if I really should buy smokes or not… I’m glad a cop didn’t see me, they would have thought I was casing out the joint! lol Anyway, I finally left and went home, no smokes bought.  That was one of the biggest days of my quit because I walked away from those ugly smokes.  When we do this, we become stronger in our quits… for me, the first 3 months were the worst, yet each day became a little easier... and each time we say NO, we win a little bit more of freedom, and before you know it, freedom is total and it's awesome! So if you are craving right now, do not let it win… make yourself the winner instead.  Kick that ugly cig habit to the curb like a bad relationship and take control of yourself.  You will never regret it.
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! What a powerful story! I have the EXACT same story, except mine turned out a little differently. Needless to say, I committed myself back to nicotine addiction. I wish I would have pulled out of that parking lot just like you.....smoke free and with freedom from nicotine. You have almost 5 years. I only have 1 day because I got out of the car and went inside. Now, I have to start over, and you are 5 years ahead of me. Well, 5 years is only time. My next 5 will be smoke free.
Wonderful post.  Thank you, Rain.
Awful to say but I was relieved to read you were 2 months into your quit and found yourself sitting there debating going in to buy a pack.  I am a month into my quit and still have to fight with myself some days (like today) not to fly off to the gas station because I've got myself convinced that I NEED one. You give me hope that its still normal to feel these brutal craves and that it'll eventually go away.
I do that are old girlfriends houses but the police call it stalking. I tried to say I was just making up my mind, but they don't buy it.
Little moments - I have always believed that it is those little moments....or looooong moment in this case that we look back on. Great post Rain!
Great post!   You never did NEED a cigarette Donna10, nicotine just made you think so.
IAmDoingIt, be proud of yourself for choosing to become a non-smoker now.  By the way, I would have been over 7 years quit, but I did relapse.  Don’t be too hard on yourself now… it’s time to look ahead and not look back!  Have a plan of something else to do when you crave: I smoked “pretend cigs” (plastic straws cut to cig-length)… and it worked… my brain actually believed it because I would get the same ritual including flicking fake ashes… lol Donna, the longer we’re quit the easier it becomes.  After a month, I didn’t have many craves, but when I did get one, it was really powerful.  You’re doing really good… believe in yourself… make YOU be the WINNER this time, not the cig… you can do it!
Great story, Rain...thanks for sharing! The last time I had a crave as I pulled up to the gas station and had to go in for something, I smelled my ashtray. It worked.  The thought of buying cigs left my head just as quickly as it appeared.  
    Bump!  Good advice from Rain who is now past a decade!
    I used to buy my smokes at the corner gas station.  I would never buy any more than one pack a day because I was always going to quit.  That meant a visit to the station every day because I never could quit.  I did become good friends with the man that owned the gas station.  I enjoyed talking with him every day.      I am ten months quit and often think I should stop and tell him I quit and miss talking to him.  Every time I pull into the station to tell him, I pull right back out.  I do not want to visit my old haunt.  I will always keep him a pleasant memory but I have no need for his store.  The gas is cheaper on the other side of town.  
Hey guys. Its juan.         I wanna be honest even though i am ashamed i could not quit smoking. That is why i left the forum. I want to quit again. But about my personal life you should know a few details that iam ashamed.     Thank to god i dont have money problems. I have a rent from my apartment but i live in my mothers house. Unemployed and with a lot of free time. I had a depression very strong last year and im seeing a doctor for this.      The thing is i smoke to kill time. I really want to quit but the free time its killing me. I just wanted to be honest. I really had a rough time with mayor treatment resistent depression so its not like i dont want to study or work. I could not get out of bed     im 32. Used to be a rugby player.       I started the gym 2 weeks ago.  sorry for the bad spelling. I have not writen in english for a few years. thank you all. The problem is lots of free time. And depression
    Welcome back Juan, glad you've been visiting again. Have you picked a new quit date because you can quit smoking. We're all proof of that. Many of us have dealt with anxiety and depression and found that although it may worsen in the beginning, it actually gets better by quitting and staying quit.  Working out is a great way to relieve some of your boredom. There's also volunteering you can do.   I wish I had of been smart enough to quit at your age instead of waiting until my health made me have to quit. Stick close to the board. Post an SOS if you feel yourself caving to a crave and give us a chance to help you past it. You owe it to yourself. You can do it 
    Hello Juan . Welcome back .     I like your post because we have lots of things in common . I have depression too . I used to smoke to kill time too .      But i threw it away because of health related concerns .        I still feel like smoking  not because of the cravings but because i don't have anything else interesting to do .       And all the interesting things in the world requires a lot of money , which i don't have too much either .      I am going through a time of recession , There will be a time of recovery and expansion too , Lol       Anyway Everyone has depression because of too much boredom i guess .        Try to find some activities you might find interesting to kill that boredom .                                
    Thank you both of you
    Welcome back Juan.      I'm a bit confused. Have you quit or are you saying you can't quit because of boredom?      Depression and boredom are two very different things. People get fed up because they are bored but it doesn't cause depression. I think you need to separate these two things or you will continue to use this as a reason to relapse.       
    Welcome back, Juan.         Free time was a tough thing for me too when I was trying to quit smoking.  Finding other ways to occupy your time helps, like what Jill said with working out or volunteering.  Keeping yourself occupied really helps.  Spend time on this board.  There are lots of things to do other than smoking.      I hope you stick around and succeed in your quit.  A smoke-free life is a great thing.
    Juan, be aware that the tricky voice of addiction will take any minor annoyance and blow it up into a major catastrophe which you can use as an excuse not to stick with your quit.  I'm not saying that boredom isn't irritating for you.  But if you were really busy and stressed out, would you be using that as a reason not to quit?  What I'm getting at is, there are always curveballs in life.  There will never be a "perfect" time to quit and there will always be something you can use as an excuse not to even bother.  Sure hope you can get your mind to that place where it needs to be so you can enjoy the benefits of a life free from smoking.  It's worth the effort.
    Welcome back Juan, glad to see that you came back (also thank you for being honest -- that can be hard at times).  Depression can be crippling but it sounds like you are aware and taking steps to overcome.  Also too much time on your hands (song title there) can be a problem.  When I quit I was a year into my retirement and was very concerned about all that time and how it would impact my quit, I used it to my advantage and spend a lot of time here on the forum (still do) and that helped pass the time and the craves, it also helps you set a goal.  Either way you can do this so hopefully you will stick around and set that new quit date in the very near future!!!!
    Hi Juan.  I am so glad you have come back.  It is so great you can be honest with us because then we know how to guide you.  I also deal with anxiety and depression.  Depression can make you feel very isolated and alone.  Well you are not that anymore.  You have all of us here wanting to help lift you up and guide you to freedom from your addiction.  You will be amazed how quitting gives you power and a huge boost in your self esteem. Smoking just plays into our feelings of  low self esteem.    Let's get this quit going.  Hang around and play some games.  Start pledging the Nope pledge.  Share with us your feelings.  There is a wonderful group here that wants to help you.     
    Welcome back, Juan...smoking to kill time is a bad idea, use time to kill smoking. Going back to the gym is a good thing. Since you like Rugby, maybe you could get in touch with some people who like to play Rugby. Depression and Boredom are two different things. Boredom is when you have nothing to do and Depression is you have no will to do anything because of some past traumatic experience or because of a really messed up situation. One could also be depressed because he/she is bored. Sometimes the line between the two can be blurred, but its important to keep the two separate. Think of some more things you like to do and work toward it. Its a very good thing you have rental income, at least dependency (if any) on family for money can be done away with. Maybe, try investing a part of that rental income. If you're on medication to treat your depression, it would be advisable to make an informed decision about the medication as such medication can cause side effects that may hinder your physical well-being. Check on the internet at authentic websites about the side effects (and if its FDA approved) and talk to your doctor if anything about the medication concerns you. Hopefully the doctor will not treat you poorly when you confront him/her about the lousy medication, if at all it is lousy, that is prescribed.
    Hello Juan. I just wanted to welcome you and ask if you have already quit again or are you still planning your quit. The good people here will give you all the support you need to quit once you take that first step. Hope you stick around on Quit Train because support from other quitters does make a difference. An there is no shame in having a relapse. Use it as a stepping stone to a successful quit  
    It's been a week. Where ya been, Juan?  EZPZ
    Juan ,  Glad to see you again ....how you getting along ....post and update us ...
    Good to see ya!!!!
                Quit smoking and reduce the risk of breathing problems, heart disease and many forms of cancer.      
    Most definitely it can as I have attested to.  Smoking leads to so many health problems -- so it takes from your health and your wallet.  Quit now it can only help you!!!
Spoiler                     I have spent quite a bit at the dentist, that pic is nasty if anyone needs a reason to quit LOOK
^^^ Thats not my teeth in the photo but i have spent over 10k and at the time i was 38 @jillar, i read on here people spent alot more

    F _____!!!      Fill in the blank with your former cigarette brand if you want to tell it to "F off" .*  F Vantage!!!       *Yes, I know we have to accept personal responsibility for starting to smoke and ultimately becoming addicted. But I still hate RJ Reynolds, the maker of my former brand Vantage, and I'll never give them another penny.  I'm free now and that's how life should be lived.

    Oh Yes, I am all for this!!!!        
https://tobaccoatlas.org/topic/health-effects           Health Effects  Using any tobacco product is harmful. Inhaling tobacco smoke exposes users to more than 7000 toxicants and at least 70 carcinogens, damaging the whole body. A regular smoker typically loses more than a decade of life.   Tobacco use is one of the most important preventable causes of premature death in the world. More than 6 million people per year die from tobacco use across the globe. There is no question that limiting tobacco use is one of the most effective ways to save lives and improve overall well-being.  Smoking tobacco causes exposure to a lethal mixture of more than 7000 toxic chemicals, including at least 70 known carcinogens that can damage nearly every organ system in the human body. Harms from tobacco begin before birth, as pregnant women who smoke give birth to infants at higher risk of congenital disorders, cancer, lung diseases, and sudden death. Newly identified risks from smoking include renal failure, intestinal ischemia, and hypertensive heart disease. The risk of death and disease from tobacco rises with the number of cigarettes smoked, but damage begins with use of a very small number of cigarettes. A regular life-long smoker loses at least 10–11 years of life to tobacco on average. In addition, exposure to secondhand or environmental tobacco smoke is associated with increased risk of cancer and heart disease, among other deleterious health effects.    Lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in the world. It has long been the leading cause of cancer death among men, and in many countries is now also the leading cause of cancer death among women, outpacing breast cancer. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in the world, and mortality from this condition is increasing in most countries; globally, 45% of all deaths from COPD are attributed to tobacco use. Similarly, death from heart disease and stroke, the two leading causes of death in the world, are heavily tied to tobacco use.  Combustible tobacco use is extremely hazardous to human health and is responsible for more than 90% of tobacco-attributable death and disease, despite efforts by the tobacco industry to market safer-sounding alternatives such as low-tar cigarettes and water pipes. Therefore, a top priority is to avoid combustible tobacco products, and the only way for an individual to completely eliminate tobacco-related harms is not to use them.       Percent of DALYs Attributable to Tobacco Use    Tobacco use is responsible for a large proportion of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) - the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.    0%19.0% No data Download    Share   Deaths from tobacco Tobacco contributes to most of the leading causes of death in the world and half of all smokers will die from tobacco-related illnesses IschemicheartdiseaseCerebrovasculardisease(strokes)ChronicobstructivepulmonarydiseaseLowerrespiratoryinfectionsTracheal,bronchus,andlungcancerDiabetesmellitusTuberculosisTobaccouseCause of Death0246810Deaths (millions)Not tobacco-relatedTobacco-related

Is this similar to the great American smoke out that is on November 15

I tried the strongest patch when I first quit but it was a bit too much for me so used the middle one instead. So did 10 weeks on that one  and yesterday I started the lowest patch.       I could really notice the difference but came here and posted when it got too much. The plan is to be on this one for 2-4 weeks.        Anyway, I'm feeling really happy I got through the day so wanted to share this little milestone                      Edited May 24 by Lilly

You have the knowledge now on how to fight the cravings and you have your vision of a smoke-free Lilly so your quit is assured as long as you continue to work your plan faithfully each and every day

    Great job Lilly.  You're doing fantastic!
    Great job, great attitude.  It should keep getting easier overall from here.  As you know, it's not always completely linear,  but you get better and better at dealing with any bumps in the road. 
    Fantastic job Lilly, you have had a great plan -- Keep it going!!!!
Keep fighting .     In my melodramatic fight with cigarettes .There was only one thing that have helped me to stay away from this addiction .   It was the 4mg strong nicotine gums .   If on any given day i have to choose between a cigarette and a gum , i would chose this 4mg gum .       Also one simple rule too .      No matter how melodramatic this addiction looks like .  I am not going out to buy cigarette's for me .

We all know the more known problems from years of smoking (Cancer, COPD, Heart problems and such) but their are some problems that are lesser known.    Today I am going to the dentist to start fixing my mouth.  Most of the problems are tied in with my smoking over those many years, something I really did not think about. For the past year it has been very difficult for me to eat and also a lot of pain. Now I have been dealing with COPD (at this point stage 1 and has done much better since quitting and not really advancing at this point) but now I have to deal with all these upcoming dental appointments to include 3 different appointments for oral surgery (first this morning) then several appointments to replace several missing teeth.  I do not enjoy going to the dentist but most of all I do not enjoy what this will be doing to my wallet.  At this point it is going to be close to $20,000.00  (there goes all the money I have been saving from my quitting).  The main point here is not sympathy for me but to let others know to include those that are lurking and have yet to make the choice to quit is that you really need to understand everything that smoking cigarettes can do to you.  It all sneaks up on you and will cost you both to health and to your wallet.  I have done this to myself and I must take accountability for my actions but hopefully others will see this and do some serious thinking!!!!!!!     Quit now so that you can live a better life in so many ways!!!!!        Sorry about the long post but I get really anxious about going to the dentist, oh alright -- scared, and it is about an hour before I can take the sedative -- anyway good day to all.Edited May 29 by Martian5
    Thanks for this post martian,  and I'm sorry you're going through all that  
Yeah - oral surgery sucks for sure (and is costly)! It's not the actual surgery so much as the aftermath healing.  At least now you will heal faster and it will be worth the $$ you put into it because you are no longer creating the problems that got you to this point so that's one good thing.       Another disease closely related to smoking that isn't in the forefront much is Buerger's disease:"Virtually everyone diagnosed with Buerger's disease smokes cigarettes or uses other forms of tobacco, such as chewing tobacco. Quitting all forms of tobacco is the only way to stop Buerger's disease. For those who don't quit, amputation of all or part of a limb is sometimes necessary."         Edited May 29 by reciprocity
    Martian thank you for this. It's a reminder that smoking is responsible for problems we don't even think about.         I'm sorry to hear you're suffering and hope you get it all sorted quickly x
I feel your pain Martian.  I posted a very similar dental nightmare earlier this year.  Smoking destroys in so many ways.  I ended up having complete implants at just under $50K out-of-pocket.    Good luck on your process.
I also posted a dental nightmare.  I had put $27,000.00 into my mouth previously and now all my implants have failed and I am looking at $10,000.00 more dental work. I have gotten a number of opinions and the consensus was not good.  Between smoking and osteoporosis I have had so much bone loss, they may not be able to replace my implants.  I also will not have enough bone to hold false teeth on the bottom.  The periodontist is going to do my surgery next week and says he will only be able to tell, at that time. if any implants can be put in.
Thanks all, back from the dentist now and bit sore (at least I have meds for the pain).  5 more appointments and two will be more oral surgery  -- take one bridge out and removal of some more teeth, then the dental implant surgery when the healing is done.  At least I am getting it taken care of, though it will cost money at least the money I am saving from quitting is going to able to pay a good deal of that

Periodontal Disease ... yet ...???" from the dentist one day.     For years they tracked the receding of the gums.    Deep cleaning / planing (horrible procedure)    Imminent surgery forthcoming ... the one where they slice your gums back, peel 'em away from the teeth so they can clean the roots ...  And then Sarge quit smokin.     Within a year and a half, all signs of active gum disease disappeared.  Receded gums will never regenerate.     Bone loss is permanent.     But no sign of disease and no progression in the better part of a decade since quitting.    You can stop gum disease in its tracks if you quit, folks.  Sarge is living proof.  EZPZ
Hi!  I've been gone for a month or so.  Living life.  Loathing life.  Loving life.  All that jazz.  During these months of living life and all that jazz,  I lost my job - or rather - it lost me?  Reduction in force.  Workforce reduction.  Position no longer needed.  Blah blah yadda yadda.  I have several months of severance and no job.       In a haze, I ventured out to the pharmacy to get some headache remedy and some other sundries.      The check out cashier was pleasant and engaging.  We talked about the weather.  Not the government (note the R.E.M. reference).     I swiped my card.  It was accepted.  I still have funds.  Yay!      I looked past my new friend.  I noticed all the packs of cigarettes.  I saw my enemy; the yellow ones.      Then, I felt the reality sink in.       After hearing the news my job no longer existed...I did not think about smoking.        I did not think about smoking.  I did not think about NOT smoking.  I did not think about anything having to do with smoking until I saw the packs.     Then, I thought...good thing I don't smoke anymore, that crap is crazy expensive.  And it is one less thing to worry about.         Then, I thought...holy shit!  I just lost my job and the thought of smoking never crossed my mind until I saw packs of cigs.        Then, I thought...holy shit! I was not even tempted to buy any!  No internal struggle, nothing, other than relief to not have to worry about it.        Then, I thought...my Lust4Life took a hit but is still shining.     So is yours.
You, my dear, have a wonderful outlook.   I am so sorry that you lost your job and will pray that something better comes along.     I am at awe in your strength and resolve.  I don't know whether I would not have caved.   You do have a wonderful Lust4Life and I think things will work out better.
@Linda Thomas  thank you so much for your kind words.  I feel like sometimes we live in a mine zone of "what ifs".  Tip toe. What will detonate our sleeping bomb?  Years after it fell into slumber? Nothing.  We got this.
    Sorry about your job lust  I'm sure with your positive outlook a new job is soon to come, and it could just end up to be your dream job This post is proof that with time all quitters can feel the same way about smoking as you do, even when they feel like they never will, so thanks for sharing, xoxo
@jillar you know it!  Job loss has some perks...this is the first time I've perused QT on an actual computer vs phone/tablet.  What a difference!  So fancy!     
    It's a defining moment when you realise you didn't go to the old and outdated "I'm stressed I need to smoke like a chimney" method of 'coping' with stress.     I hope you find a great job soon!
Sorry about the job loss, L4L...At least you have several months severance...will allow for some breathing space while you start the hunt!  One door closes....another one opens...and may it lead to an even better job for you!
    Imagine job hunting and trying to mask the stench of stale smoke on your clothing and hair; slugging a capful of mouthwash; trying to scrub the yellow stains off your fingers.     Not to mention having that nagging feeling in the back of your mind during a job interview of “when the hell is this going to end so I can run outside and have a smoke?”   Without all that BS to worry about, the real,  positive you can shine through. Undoubtedly, she’s the one who gets hired  
Hey L4L, good that you wrote that down. These are the memorable moments, important part of out quits. It shows how far youve come in cutting ties with addiction. And isnt it absurd how strong reactions to these images are, seeing a pack and instantly wanting one? Good thing is, that effect will diminish over time as well. Than its just a pack of cigarettes, without meaning.        I whish you the best in dealing with the job loss and the hunt for something new!
    Loosing an income source is horrible. Happy to know that you didn't think of smoking!!!
I'm job hunting.  Just FYI to lurkers- some places require a "smobriety" test.  Meaning, they are a 100% tobacco and NICOTINE free company.  Each applicant must consent to a blood test to detect any nicotine in their system.  ANY meaning one must disclose the use of NRT or vaping.       Easy peasy lemon squezzy from this sour puss.

I am shocked.  I did not realize this was legal in the U.S. I could see a test for drugs but not smoking.  Smoking is not illegal (though it should be) It must feel good to have this plus on your job hunting side.   Know that I am praying something comes along soon.
    Sorry to read about the job loss but so impressed by your great attitude. Will be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers that all goes well. Thanks for your great outlook on keeping your quit.  
    Being alone tested my quit the most.  Just me and my addiction....   
    Ironically the thing that has tested my quit the most isn't me or smoking - it's other people.      Oh you're using NRT     You haven't really quit as your still using nicotine        How long is this one going to last      Then there's the "how to quit properly police". If you're not doing it how they think it should be done you're doomed.      Oh and shops who don't stock marmite crisps. They are my go to crave buster and I get a bit panicked when I can't find them.

As long as you follow a plan to use NRT products safely and properly with an aim to reduce and get off altogether then who cares. It's the path that works for YOU.  You're getting into no man's land where most don't want to hear about the struggles you still go through in quitting. Your hopes and your fears about having a successful life long quit. The people here on this forum do though and that's when I believe it's most important that people stick around. Once that shine wears off the brand new quit and it's just down to working what you've learned until you are on solid ground.     We don't stock or sell marmite crisps though - you're on your own with that one
@reciprocity everything you have said made complete sense and helps.        The forum is a lifeline for me and as you say everyone here understands. I might go and read up on some no man's land stuff later on this afternoon.        I might get a bag of Smokey Bacon today to honour you

No, no.... no!      Was just binging 'Dead to me', netflix series. So far, so good. Ok for a saturday evening on the couch, tea, beers and crochet. Right in the middle of the 4th episode, clues come together, secrets are out in the open, two girl friends having dinner and wine and the dirt is literally on the dinner table. Tears, anger, some jealous car scratching and then.... one of  'm buys cigarettes and the other one says she loves her for it...! And ofcourse they light up and immediately calm down and have a reasonable conversation... oh right.         I am in shock! This is soooo Marlboro man old fashion.. how can they still do it like that? I thought we were past that? Apparantly NOT.        The only nice thing about it... i felt true repulsion. Really, what a cheap move.       -Edit- ah I was too quick. She cant get it lit! Well. What about that. Weird.    Edited May 18 by MLMR
I suppose the reality of life is that millions of people still smoke. I think by removing smoking/drinking/drugs it would also remove that reality of life.         We are quitters so we view that scene differently to a lot of other people. Never smokers and smokers probably never even viewed it the way you did - in fact they probably never thought about it at all.          I once blew a quit because someone was smoking in a programme. How pathetic is that lol.        Hope things are ok with you.  Sounds like a perfect evening to me.  Only thing I would add is some cheese and onion crisps                   Edited May 18 by Lilly

    The part I find disturbing is that hey are promoting the lie we all buy into, that smoking calms you in a tense situation. This is the major stumbling block for many people quitting. Not understanding the difference between nicotine addiction stress and life stress. Cigarettes only solve one kind of stress and it's NOT life stress!

No they kids who fought didn't because even doctors smoked back then. The issuing of cigs during wartime was a major boost to Big Tobacco.

Everything I've read says the health risks were highlighted in the fifties which is obviously after the war so I'm still confused.      I have family who fought in both wars and none of them smoke thankfully. Not everyone took it up despite getting them free.         Smoking kills but so did the wars they were in. Neither smoking or dying fighting should have been allowed. Edited May 19 by Lilly

Yeah - I've seem footage of kids like 6 or 7 puffing away in Indonesia. Disgusting! I went to Europe a few years ago and was shocked at how many smokers there still were (and I was a smoker then too). Also, here in Canada, the Province of Quebec is very bad for smoking. Up until a year ago you could still get smoking rooms in some hotels. A lot of French Canadians smoke like crazy. One of their own Provincial party leaders was a chain smoker. Never saw him without a smoke in his mouth. Oh .... guess what? He's dead now  Edited May 19 by reciprocity
@reciprocity there was a video that went viral of a four year old and then a 3 year old smoking (both from Indonesia).      Teenagers make their own choices but it broke my heart to see those babies.

Our 2016 quitters are the butt kickers. 2017 we have the Smoke Busters, 2015 are known as the Badashes and 2014, The Avengers. I don't know what happened to the 2018 members not having a name but it's never too late. So 2019 quitters, are you guys going to unite with a team name?

    And it looks great there @abbynormal   
    I think the logo is awesome. Great work 
    oooh  I'm an Avenger?  I'll need to put a "No Smoking" sticker on my Iron Man suit.      
Hey ya'll!! I am super proud bc i am 9 months smoke free!!!! Again, I am blessed bc i have had no cravings at all! Life is better, anxiety significantly decreased as well. It was torture when i quit years ago, but this i am so grateful for!    How are you all doing? I always lurk haha, thanking you all again
    Congratulations Christa! I'm glad this quit has been so easy for you, you're definitely one of the lucky ones  
Great job on the 9 month mark, glad everything is going good for you on this quit -- keep strong!!!!
Congrats Christa! 9 months is amazing, and good to hear its going well too, that is a blessing
Could you clarify if you are several years quit or 9 months quit? Just asking because you mention that you're 9 months quit and then say that you quit years ago. Either way, congratulations on a great quitEdited May 14 by Ankush
Big congrats on 9 months Christa. That's fabulous and yes, having an easier time is a blessing. That doesn't happen often. Stay vigilant though and we'll be soon celebrating your 1 year!      Now, where you at? We're already partying in recognition of this anniversary. Common down!!
    Congrats Christa! Good to know that youre still here. Happy to hear about your anxiety decreasing, thats terrific news. 
    Congratulations Christa.        I always enjoy watching the benefits of quitting accumulate for a fellow traveler.
    Congratulations Christa.  I'm thrilled to hear you are doing so well in your quit.  Great job!
    Congratulations on your beautiful, full-term quit!
Congrats, Christa326! Celebrate and KTQ!

9 months is awesome.        Lovely to hear you are enjoying your quit
So yeah, I smoked for 30 years. I never smoked in the house, which meant I was either in the front or back yard smoking. Never really thought about how it was for my neighbors that didn't smoke.      So now here I am, 2+ years quit and I have a neighbor that smokes and I'll be damned if I don't have a conniption every time I smell it. I purposely (and passively aggressively) shut the windows harder than I need to so they're sure to hear it. I sometimes will even say a bit too loudly "GOD! It f***ing stinks out here!" so I know they hear me. Thing is, they're pretty cool neighbors and I really shouldn't be such an ass.   But I am an ass. It angers me to no end that they couldn't care less that they're polluting MY house with smoke from THEIR disgusting habit.        I would never lecture someone about quitting smoking. That's not my business, but man, I'm a big baby when it comes to other people's smoke.        Me, of all people...        I guess the only thing worse than a smoke is an ex-smoker.      That is all
    I guess it would have been OK to say something to your neighbors if you had never picked up smoking and even then, it is not your choice (no offense meant) to tell anybody what they can or cannot do with their lives. If they're good neighbors as you say, sit down with them and talk to them directly rather than shutting the windows harder than usual or passing comments.
You could always get a fan.  They might get the message Jim I think now that we have found our freedom, we have no patience for the filthy habit.
    Ooh lord.       I get that smells can be offensive. Someone who lives in my road has a dog and the dog always insists on saying hello. Sometimes I just want to scream " tell your stinking dog to piss off". I don't have dogs and I don't take kindly to pet owners who think it's ok to allow theirs to come and lick my feet or jump up at me. They lick their @rse and then they use that same tongue to lick strangers yuck!                       
    That is being hypocritical Jim, my next door neighbors smoke too and they b.b.que every weekend so since the wind always blows from the west we can smell the smoke inside our house as well. However, I would never even think about telling them not to smoke or b.b.que in their own yard. I know that they have put up with many a loud night coming from our house with the music blaring and people drinking and talking over the music lol
    Here's one, I just got back this week from a week long cruise. I didn't realize or pay attention to just how many people actually smoked before. My spouse still smokes so I went up to the smoking side one afternoon. I couldn't get over the smell that was up there. I found myself feeling like you Jim. I ended up telling her I didn't belong there any longer and left. I left feeling like a snob but I couldn't help it. I pray I never fall because I saw so much self destruction that week ,  and I honestly don't remember noticing that or smelling that much smoke. I actually found myself struggling to breathe at times. I like this so much better, let's never fail.
Last cruise I was on, I only felt sorry for the people who were huddled underneath the stairwell smoking all day long.  Same people, all the time, every day = slavery to addiction  Why not take full advantage of the $$ you have spent to go on a cruise instead of huddling under cover smoking? Just goes to show how powerful this addiction is.Edited May 12 by reciprocity

So is it just that area you outlined or are the people in the lounge chair able to smoke?   What about the people on the upper tier?   Sorry I've never been on a cruise        It seems that on an open air deck, maybe the rear of the ship would be an ideal smoking area.    Edited May 12 by Wayne045

I agree that it's strange having them all huddled under cover because it does hold the smoke in there more than if it were completely open. I was on one ship where the smoking area was up on the top deck in a completely open area but most are not. Maybe it's covered so people can still smoke when it rains or maybe so ashes aren't blowing all over the place?         Frankly, I'm surprised not one cruise line that I'm aware of has banned smoking all together - not one! It's a huge fire issue as you can imagine. You don't want to be floating in the middle of the ocean with a fire breaking out. I'm betting some cruise line will do it sometime soon. It's a very small percentage of people that I see smoking on a cruise so they aren't going to lose too many customers if they ban it outright and a lot of their non smoking customers would applaud them for having a smoke-free cruise
In my addiction, the morning was the time of day when I would bang out 4 or 5 cigs. with a cup of coffee and watch the news before work.  This morning I realized that my routine is still the same minus the cigs and my flesh is not screaming/crawling for one!! I was so happy because my first few days of my quit that was the most difficult for me.  You all said it would get easier and it is. I just wanted to share that with you. Thank you
Did you relapse? Your counter is off. Quitting is about time. The more time, the easier it becomes. You done completed your daily milestones and now you're working on weeks. Keep looking forward to the next one (2nd week in your case) for a sense of accomplishment. It's a very good feeling when the milestones are achieved. Get to your monthly milestones and it becomes much better. The milestones really start to pay off...………...You can do this, we have.
Hi, my quit date is March 12, 2019. I quit smoking before I joined the group and  then I was having problems setting the darn thing!! But thank you Ethan I am looking onward and upward    No I didn't relapseDo you know how I can correct that
    Well looka here I fixed it!
    Glad you're feeling so good already QueenB, you've almost got two months under your belt now so onward and upward, you're doing awesome 
    Thank you Jillar. I don't want to sound like I'm over-the-top with this, but no one could have told me that this was possible FOR ME!! I was a tough little mama about my cigarettes! Not anymore, I am a non-smoker and I'm LOVING IT      Hey Ethan, we can chalk it up to the foggy brain. LOL
    Great job, your getting the jist of it now -- !!!
    Great going QueenB
Thank you all for the encouragement.  It was NOT easy and I certainly don't want to come across like it was.  I worked very hard, educated myself, and still have a lot of work to do! I'm just happy in this moment.  In my research(IDK where)I came across something that said, at the beginning of your initial quit most people will be very encouraging, supportive. But after say 3rd  week and laterPeople have forgotten/don't care about your quit.  YOU, then in turn have to encourage yourself as you go through this process. It's an awesome time if you can get through the first couple of days. I do anything, any how, any way NOT  to take another puff.
@jillar do your bump thing with the mental balloons for QueenB x
    Oh god - I sound like I'm ordering you to do that - sorry Jillar x   @QueenB have a read of the mental balloons thread. It really fits well with what you said above

I used to see people smoking outside restaurants or at a party and I was so jealous that they got to keep smoking and I had to quit.  Which really makes no sense since I chose to quit, but that's the feeling I had anyway.  I quit smoking on December 27th 2017, and that feeling of jealousy went away a few months ago.  Now I see people smoking and I feel bad that they have to take that time to feed their craving.  Usually they're standing all by themselves and it doesn't look like much fun. It looks like a compulsion.        I was thinking about it this morning on my way home from taking the kids to school because I realized I was in no rush to be anywhere.  I used to be in a rush to go home and have my smoke, because I hid it from my kids and would wait for them to get to school so I could feed my craving.  I have saved so much time in my life day to day by not having to stand alone on the porch smoking a cigarette.  Not to even mention the time I've hopefully saved by not dying young from some smoking-related disease.
    I had the same feelings of why do they get to smoke and I have to quit! Glad you're doing so well farmgirl and thank you for the great post 
    Farmgirl,  I was the same with my kids.  I would get them to school and could not wait to relax and have my cigarette.  I knew then that it was wrong and did not want my children following my path.   As far as watching others smoke, I never felt jealous that they could and I was quitting.  I kind of chuckle now, because I critique how they smoke.  Some take long drags and savor their cigarette and some take quick, little puffs and have to flick their ash every time.  None of them look sexy or mature to me, which is the lure that made me want to smoke when I was a young adult.  I have so much empathy for them.  The young ones most likely haven't gotten it yet.  Then I wonder if the older ones feel as I did - ashamed and helplessly stuck?  
    I feel envy when I see smokers. I think because I've quit for good reasons but not because I really wanted to. If there wasn't a dying/health risk with smoking I'd still be doing it.      I'm pleased for you Farmgirl and glad you are so happy with your quit. 
    I don't feel envy when I see smokers puffing away on a cigarette. I haven't seen any smokers in a long time (I always look down and walk) but I can get the smell of cigarettes. And when I get the smell of cigarettes, the thought I immediately get in my mind is "Crap, I hope I don't relapse".

    I no longer feel envy for smokers when I see them.  I look at what I used to do and be and those are not good thoughts anymore.  I now look at smokers in some sort of amazement that they continue to doing harm to themselves -- and many times they look so lonely and at times agitated with what they are doing -- keeps me strong on my own quit at this time!!!

    The title of this thread says it all. That's exactly what I feel now when I see some poor soul standing alone feeding their addiction while the world passes them by.   As Boo said; there's nothing to miss about smoking  
    "The lows become the highs."  I heard that line in a video I was watching last night about the Bob Graham Round, a fell running ultramarathon in England.  The quote is true of any challenge, including quitting smoking.      When I look back at the early days of my quit, it's not the anniversaries and milestones that are really emblazoned on my brain.  It is those moments of discomfort and struggle that I remember fondly now.  Distance and time allow me to laugh at those moments now, but in that moment, the easiest thing to do would have been simply to light up a cigarette and carry on with killing myself with smoking.       I chose to stay smokefree.  Even when that voice of addiction was screaming and thrashing about, I stayed true to my commitment.  What looked like the easy route was actually the most difficult.  Lighting up would have kept me on the same endless cycle of addiction, regret, and self loathing I was looking to escape.  Quitting, simply not smoking, seemed to be the difficult route at the time but turned out to be more rewarding than I could have imagined at the time.       Rarely is anything worth having attained without some effort.  The struggle you embrace today may turn out to be one of your greatest rewards.
When something is fundamental there emerge a flood of quotes and expressions to capture that truth.  I like the axiom "The lows become the highs."   I have a quote under my ticker that evokes a similar sentiment.New beginnings are often disguised as painful endings.  Thanks for the wise words Boo.  Stick with it newbies.  You'll get to that point where the awful lows you feel initially will, in retrospect, become the badges of honor on your way to an amazing new life.         Edited May 9 by BKP
Thanks for this.  I too do not look back at milestones during my quit, I also remember the difficult times along with the early struggles.  The only milestone I really remember is the 1 year mark since I was truly amazed that I made it that far.   My quote of late has been "With every challenge comes new opportunities", I have found great opportunities since quitting!!!!!
It always seemed impossible until I met all of you.   The addiction makes you feel as if it is impossible.  Now, I feel like I have run the marathon but that you were all there to hold me up and help me cross the finish line.The smoking is just a distant thought now.  I have the power to live life without it.  Thank you    
    Great post boo and while I can't say I look back at the difficult days fondly, I can say that I'm happy to be past them 
    Thank you Boo for this great post, I also feel so proud of standing up to that "voice" and ploughing on with my quit.   Today I feel very different...
    I feel very proud of all of you. I'm still at the hard stage so knowing you all stuck it out is awesome.        Well done all of you x

For Nancy       Mental Balloons Posted by gonfishn21 on 16 January 2015 - 06:17 PM  As I'm now chasing the tweenie label, and have been thinking a lot about the concerns I have had regading No Man's Land, its got me thinking again. As most of you know, that means I'm going to ramble.    Although I am not one that needs a lot of kudos, it seems that it is a necessary part of this process for a while.  We make it through day 1 HURRAH!!!!!!!!!!   We make it through hell week HURRAY!!!! Heck week over, " I feel better" HURRAy!!   Two weeks, wow, learning to get through the craves, HURRay! Three weeks, can be around my friends and family without committing a felony, HURray    Four weeks, nerves under control, waistband a little tight, not bad, HUrray Five weeks, walking, eating right, digestion shut down, but not smoking, Hurray Six weeks, no craves, no moods, no smoking, digestion shut down, HUH?   Seven to eight weeks, no one wants to know but you, how you are doing. By the way, my digestion is shut down!   They really stopped wanting to hear weeks ago, you just kept talking about it. You can see it in their eyes when you walk up. They probably have a pool about how long it will take you to bring it up. Or even worse, the day your digestion works!    Yeah, wow woot woot yippee, big deal.   Hello No Man's Land'    How am i going to keep going with this? I need to bring my own ballons to the party. I know my friends and family care, but they dont get it.   Even as firm as I have been since day one, this is one of the hardest things I have ever done. I know it, thats all that matters.   As i reach the little milestones ahead, I need to be the one who says HURRAY!!!!!.  I need to be the one who acknowledges the accomplishments. Afterall, in the end, I made the decision to quit, I made it through hell week, heck week, and i am the one who may never digest food again. I need to remind myself everyday, how much I have accomplished, BEFORE I have a chance to get weak. In that way, I can stay ahead, be ready to face any challenge with a strong defense.    Smoking is no longer an option for me. Smoking is just something I used to do. I control my actions, and smoking is a choice. I choose not to smoke, even if I never digest food again. I found a website the other day, that actually teaches you HOW TO SMOKE. I couldn't believe it. It takes you through lighting it, drawing on it, how it feels.......Holy Crap I was feeling it!!!!! Two flipping months into this, and I was feeling it, and then I knew. I had to make mental ballons and carry them with me at all times. Everyday is a celebration, everyday needs reminders, and everyday has its challenges. There is no one here, that can not do it. I'm not special. I'm just going to carry my own balloons.   Just sayin, Gon
    Bump
OMG.. I remember this post so well.. it was just what I needed to hear in the early days of my quit.. I have treasured your words ever since gonfishn.      And yes, 1 year 8 months down the line I am still carrying my mental balloons because I am proud of me
 
    Oh yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about!!
This is my second attempt quitting with Chantix. I have just finished my starter pack and have already gone from 20+ cigarettes a day to around 8-10. I am wondering if i added a nicotine patch would that be counter productive, since I have already reduced my nicotine intake by reducing the number of cigarettes a day?
    I would say no. The whole point is to rid yourself of nicotine. Not string yourself along. Smoke until your quite date and then don't smoke.        Stick with what your Dr. recommends.
    Welcome aboard Mike, I agree with Jim above.  Chantix is designed to reduce your overall desire to smoke.  Again I would discuss this with your Dr.  
    Welcome Mike and congratulations on your decision to quit. I agree with above. Why would you want to add the patch? Now that you are through the starter pack the pills are stronger and will help further reduce your desire to smoke.
I probably would check with your doctor.        I'm no expert but isn't champix supposed to do something to the nicotine receptors. If the idea is to make you dislike smoking adding loads more nicotine would surely be almost fighting against what it does. As I say I'm no expert.     Give the champix a chance to do its thing. It's clearly working so see where you are in a few days more.        I know in my quit smoking clinic they advise eating half yiur breakfast, then take the champix, then finish your breakfast. It apparently helps to stop the nausea feeling IF you get that. Edited May 8 by Lilly
I wonder, what about smoking is it that made me live life from the sideline?    Looking back at my smokey years, its like Ive been on a constant watch for smoke facilitating circumstances. It was ALWAYS in the back of my mind, I was building life around smoking instead of the other way 'round. I dont know how I did that. It seems so, so tiring!  I cant help but feel like one of those actors in a Tell Sell commercial: its amaaaaaazing!! But... It really is, to me. Time is flying (since 5, 6 weeks) and every morning I wake up after a good night of sleep. Instead of cursing the whole world and whishing not to be talked to before Ive had coffee and at least three cigarettes, I actually do usefull sensible stuff like sleeping a bit late, or pre-read work mail, humming along and well, ladiedahdiedahh.  There's still some serious shit going on and its been a pretty hectic past 8 months. But, I decide now. Not the cigarette. No more cravings or 'empty cigarette moments', and yet, prepared with a huge backpack full of knowledge and confidence might they return for some reason.    I remember people saying, be proud! And then I tried to be, but often didnt feel like it. I promiss you, that moment will come. Quitting is a super dynamic proces, ups, downs, left, right, hey I am ok, hell no I am not, hey I think Im there and oh shoot, id kill for a smoke right now... and so on. But time goes on, seasons change and you form new habits to challenge your addiction patterns and you learn new skills and you will get used to the new you.         I know I did! Its amaaazing!
Good for you MLMR!  You are so right how smoking dominates your life when you are a smoker.  I'm looking forward to being a happy non-smoker too.  But for now, I'm a quitter in hell week!  GrrrrrEdited May 7 by Mona
    I really love a cigarette right now , But i am not going out and buying it .    Health concerns are the only reason .

    Great post MLMR.  I also felt the same at one point.  It can and does become a thing of the past.  What a wonderful feeling to know that it no longer has a hold on you.
    Totally agree with your post MLMR, a good capture of your journey so far and how you have a strong grasp now.  I remember how the last few years of my smoking life that cigarettes had total control of my life and everything I did and planned (also had those mornings you mentioned -- never deal with me until a cup of coffee and a couple of cigarettes).  It is so much better now that the control of nicotine is no longer there.  Great job on your quit to this point!!!
    Great Post MLMR!  Not only are you changing what for years you never thought you could, but soon you feel the strength (that was always there) to change other things too.  When you reach the one year mark you should make time to re-read all of your early posts and the responses you were given.  Future you will be amazed at past you.
    Great post. I needed to read something like this today. Can't wait to get where you are. Thanks for sharing this. 
The Law of Addiction     Most quitting literature suggests that it normally takes multiple failed quitting attempts before the user self-discovers the key to success. What they fail to tell you is the lesson eventually learned, or that it can be learned and mastered during the very first try.    Successful recovery isn't about strength or weakness. It's about a mental disorder where by chance our dopamine pathway receptors have eight times greater attraction to a nicotine molecule than to the receptor's own neurotransmitter. We call it the "Law of Addiction" and it states:  "Administration of a drug to an addict will cause re-establishment of chemical dependence upon the addictive substance."    Roughly half of relapsing quitters report thinking that they thought they could get away with using just once. The benefit of fully accepting that we have a true chemical dependency and permanent priorities disorder can't be overstated. It greatly simplifies recovery's rules while helping protect against relapse.  Key to arresting our illness is obedience to one simple concept, that "one is too many and a thousand never enough." There was always only one rule, no nicotine just one hour, challenge and day at a time.    Navigating Withdrawal and Reclaiming Hijacked Dopamine PathwaysLike clockwork, constantly falling nicotine reserves soon had hostage dopamine pathways generating wanting for more. Sensing that "want" thousands of times per year, how could we not expect to equate quitting to starving ourselves to death?     Again, the essence of drug addiction is about dependency quickly burying all memory of our pre-dependency self. Thus, the first step in coming home and again meeting the real us is emptying the body of nicotine.     It's amazingly fast too. Cut by half every two hours, our mind and body become 100% nicotine-free within 72 hours of ending all use. Extraction complete, peak withdrawal now behind you, true healing can begin. While receptor sensitivities are quickly restored, down-regulation of the number of receptors to levels seen in never-users may take up to 21 days.   But within two to three weeks your now arrested dependency is no longer doing the talking. Quitting fears and dread are gradually thawing and melting into "like" or even "love." You're beginning to sense the truth about where you've been.  It's critical during early withdrawal to not skip meals, especially breakfast. Attempting to do so will likely cause blood sugar levels to plummet, making recovery far more challenging than need be. Why?     A stimulant, nicotine activates the body's fight or flight response, feeding the addict instant energy by pumping stored fats and sugars into the bloodstream. It allowed us to skip breakfast and/or lunch without experiencing low blood sugar symptoms such as feeling nervous or jittery, trembling, irritability, anxiousness, anger, confusion, difficulty thinking or an inability to concentrate. Minimize or avoid those symptoms. Eat little, healthy and often.  If your diet and health permit, drink some form of natural fruit juice for the first three days. Cranberry juice is excellent. It will aid in stabilizing blood sugar while accelerating removal of the alkaloid nicotine from your bloodstream.    Also, heavy caffeine users need to know that (as strange as this sounds), nicotine doubles the rate by which the liver eliminates caffeine from the bloodstream. One cup of coffee, tea or one cola may now feel like two. While most caffeine users can handle a doubling of intake, consider a modest reduction of up to one-half if feeling anxious, irritable or unable to sleep following caffeine use.    One caution. While we need not give-up any activity except nicotine use, use extreme caution with early alcohol use as it is associated with roughly 50% of all relapses.       The above is an excerpt from John Polito's article, "Nicotine Addiction 101". It explains the science behind why it is so darn difficult to quit nicotine and to stay quit.        The full article is here: Nicotine Addiction 101Edited May 4 by Aine
Last night, long after I should have been asleep, I paced a few times in my home, craving sugar. Craving a cigarette, actually, but I told myself a hit of sugar would fix the craving. I have no junk food.  I went to bed. Back up. I changed from my sleeping clothes to my street clothes, grabbed my purse and keys and headed for my car and the convenience store for cigarettes.        I'd been watching a Jordan Peterson lecture earlier. He said that life is painful, messy,, and chaotic, and that to avoid as much pain and suffering as possible, one has to have an aim, a worthwhile goal. It is not the attainment of the goal that is important, it is the working toward the goal or aim. Once you get there, you have to set another.         The point he made that stuck with me as I headed out the front door, was that any action that was not on the trajectory toward that worthwhile aim is a wrong action and guaranteed to cause pain.  I'd made myself a schematic with one line pointing toward the aim of a productive life, and another line slanting downward toward disease, misery, and shortened years. Peterson's words and the visual of the schematic overrode the urge to smoke, and I went back inside and went to bed.        Up again 15 minutes later, back in street clothes, going out to buy chocolate cake at the 24 hour grocery.  Peterson's words echoed again, and back to bed. Tried to relax and fall asleep, I flashed on having bought a fudge brownie mix on sale to have on hand in case I was struggling with nicotine cravings. A substitution serotonin-generator for smoking powerful enough to break through cravings. Back out of bed, baked the brownies as I watched more Jordan Peterson, ate a brownie. Now relaxed and craving for both smoking and sugar gone.        Awoke at 4:30 am at the insistence of my small dog, Sofia, who urgently wanted to go outside to pee and was hungry. Took her outside for a moment, gave her a small portion of her daily food, and crawled back to bed.     Dreamed that I had been forced to return to work at my previous employer's. It was a high-pressure, low-paid, dirty job, sorting donations in a thrift store. I succumbed to smoking, sneaking outside, afraid they'd smell the smoke and I'd be in trouble. Awoke to the sound of the chimes of my alarm clock, feeling heavy from lack of enough sleep and saddened that I'd lapsed.  The dream was so real, full color, the grass of the courtyard green, and I could feel the cold metal of the glass door frame as I tried to hold it open a crack as I smoked so that I could get back inside.  After waking, it took some seconds to separate the dream from reality and a few minutes to dispel the low feeling that I'd failed again. Cheerier now, and ready for a new day.           Peterson said in the same lecture,--citing Jung, I believe--that we are less in control of our behavior than we'd like to believe. After the trouble I've experienced staying quit, I feel the impact of his words. I believe it likely that I will lapse again because--in bipolar cycling--my perception of reality changes. Most of the time, I know the value of being quit. During the short but inevitable segment of despair that recurs every six weeks to three months, nihilism takes over and I become hostile to the nonsmoking voice in my head and take revenge by starting in again. I am hoping that I will gain enough wisdom from Peterson's lectures that maybe I can thwart self-destructive behavior and sustain a commitment.  And that vigorous exercise will uplift my mood.        Day at a time; craving at a time.
Thank you for this post Kate18, it was very helpful. I've had trouble staying quit as well. You should be proud of yourself for working through your cravings last night. Like you and everyone says...one day and even one minute at a time; one craving at a time.
        Quote               I believe it likely that I will lapse again because                 You've already started planning it?  You need to make yourself know that smoking is not an option anymore.  There are all sorts of other choices you can make, but smoking is no longer on the list.  It will get easier but it takes time.
    Kate, when you feel you're going to relapse PLEASE post here so that we can help you past it. It does work, it did for me and countless others. You owe yourself that much...………..
    Kate I love reading about your quit.        I haven't experienced bi-polar personally but someone very close to me has it so I have watched the changes they go through. It's not something you can plan for or avoid so I am sending you strength and good wishes x         
    Kate I too like your posts -- it is showing your journey in an honest way and that will come back to help you -- please keep posting as it will bring you a bit more confidence.  As to the dream, I too had a couple of those and like you I felt guilt upon waking and was so relieved when I realized it was a dream.  Keep strong and keep coming back to find more positive re-enforcement, you can do this, it is in you!!!!
    Cigarettes do nothing for us. They take away our time, our money and our health.        Seriously. They do nothing for you. I could understand if it was like weed and got you buzzed.  Or made you feel superhuman…    But no, they do nothing…    Absolutely nothing.  Go figure.
According to this ,     An average smoker inhales 1 to 2 milligrams of of nicotine per cigarette        A nicotine gum is a 4mg gum .       So that mean's eating a nicotine gum is equivalent to 2 cigarettes ?                I don't want to ingest 2 cigarette worth of nicotine gums every time i have an uncomfortable craving , even though i have been using it only once a week .              I didn't know that eating 1 gum was equivalent to 2 cigarettes .        So i am planning to throw away all the gums i have right now .
    Good for you redemption, you've got four months under your belt so that is the logical next step 
    Getting nicotine out of your body is the last step you will have to take to become truly free!
Want to know a secret...if I open my purse right now there will be 2 gums in there...just in case...I know I have them but not once since I stopped the gum have I even been tempted to have them. I think you are ready @Redemption3 to get rid of them for good. ... Look how far you have come...you should be super proud of yourself.
    Smoking cessation products are more about making companies rich and not so much about helping people quit smoking.  We have heard "I tried gums, patches, etc..."        I do think though more nicotine is absorbed in the mouth than through the lungs.   It seems to me then like nicotine gum would be more addictive than cigarettes.
    @jillar , reciprocity , notsmokinjo     Thanks a lot for the support .      @Jet Black ,        Eating these gums was becoming a habit , but i think it was way better than inhaling the smoke and ruining one's lungs   
    I agree I think it is time you get rid the gum, you are doing great now and from what you state you really are not using the gum much now.  Maybe the gum is just a crutch at this time-- time to let it go!!!!
The gum was a very useful tool for me when I quit.  I continued to carry a couple of pieces around with me for several months after I stopped chewing it (chewed it for 2-3 months), just in case I felt like I needed extra assistance in those still early stages of the quit.  In my experience, claims of long-term nicotine gum dependence are wildly exaggerated and ultimately unhelpful to the quitters who choose NRT as part of their recovery.  Also, scientifically speaking, inhaling burning cigarette smoke is a far more efficient delivery method of nicotine (and every other chemical) than chewing the gum.  It's not even close, so a piece of gum is not like two cigarettes.   It's not a bad idea to try to stop chewing entirely, but I wouldn't worry too much about it--you're doing great!      Christian99 Nearing 17 1/2 Years Quit
Thanks Martian5 , Christian99 .     I haven't touched NRT gums since 1/5/2019 .But i am feeling a bit too dull without any of these .       Too bored i guess . I am not sitting here doing nothing either , I have loads to study too for the next 4 more months , after that my degree course ends too .      So i am tired and excited too .     I am feeling a bit empty without any of these things , other than that i am feeling OK .        Its not cravings , Its just plain boredom
    Have you tried regular gum ...if it's just boredom ,this will keep your mouth busy ....
    Yes , I will try that       I want to try the  plainest gum out there without any special flavors

It's all very personal. Even though the methods used to quit are the same with slight variations depending on an individual's preference it all is a very personal thing. You always choose what works for you or just wing it. You do that on your own, always. Some plans I see I just cringe, but you know it usually ends up that it works for that person. A step-wise plan to quit is a good idea but doesn't need to be complex, and a fallback plan is even better. You can start by acting like a nonsmoker; see yourself a few weeks and a few months from now. What do you look like, what are you doing?Get to the reading and the writing. Post and become a part of this forum and pay it forward to cement your quit in your mind. You will do this on your own with a little help (minimal) assistance from your friends here. Nobody can quit for you, but you can learn how to stay quit here.Any or all of items 1-7 below, will make it better.(1) Commit to Not One Puff Ever (NOPE).(2) Commit to Never Take Another Puff (NTAP).(3) Educate yourself about your addiction. Read, post, learn, overcome. Lather, rinse, repeat.(4) Decide that you do not want to smoke more than you want to smoke. This may save you from relapse.(5) Take control of your life, reclaim your mind and body, and get it straight about who owns you. Is it you? Or your addiction?(6) Realize that you'll always be an addict, a puff away from a pack a day, but you choose not to smoke. That's all of us.(7) Start acting like a non smoker, like you never smoked, walk the walk. A cigarette is never the answer to anything but disease.( 8 Have a plan B if Plan A that you are using now fails. Make your plan B from steps 1-7, above.*(9) Celebrate your quit! Talk it up, be proud of what you have accomplished!Alright, enough with the steps and commitment to this and that already! Look at this logically if you will.  :) How else can you possibly quit smoking by any other means than stopping using cigarettes? The addiction to nicotine cannot be overcome by administering the same thing to yourself that you are addicted to, (nicotine).  What that means is when you are at 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, 28 days quit, and you find yourself craving a cigarette (your delivery device for nicotine), you cannot beat that crave/association with a cigarette. You might fix a bad hangover with some hair of the dog that bit you, but you can't fix a cigarette crave with a cigarette and still expect to quit smoking. Can you? Now go look at the items again, you have the desire.  What is missing if anything? You decide along the way, revamp the plan if you need to, adapt to your conditions, if something isn't working, get rid of it. Anything to keep the quit. You have to be fair to yourself, but firm. It will get better over time, but you'll only see it if you commit to it. And so you will. Welcome to a new life! :)
Thank you so much Markus! Reading - writing and posting has helped me a lot. I just went through some of my early notes and laughed. I sound like I don't know what I am doing....I really recommend it to everybody! It's like a free therapy session
great post Markus!  
Very good, and educational Markus....tks
Any lurkers out there - worried about quitting? Will you fail? Will you feel terrible? Don't worry! No you won't. Now you will feel fantastic! Jump in - read, post...it will save your life....
Brilliant post Markus I can imagine folk finding that very helpful.
Words of wisdom.  Thank you.  :)
Bringing this forward.. X
Bump..
I hadn't spotted this glad it was brought to the front line Thanks
I wonder where dear Markus is?  How is his quit?  I want to be babs and Nancy and MDQuitter, here supporting Newbs like me, celebrating my 3 yrs quit, yet never forgetting how close an addict is to a relapse and letting this community serve as my reminder. All whilst helping myself remain vigilant. Thank you to those of you on the lido deck and beyond for staying to help us newbies.
I think it's important to continue to pay it forward and keep the addict in us honest.  Somewhere on this board is a thread where you pledge to stay on here for one year minimum.  It really does make a difference.  NOPE every day for a year  =  super impactful.
It is on the main Discussion Board..second post down..sorry I'm not very savvy to link it here..
I forgot about this post. I am still around, my quit is good, going on 10 years. Wow, I feel old. I turned 60 this year. We have 8 grandchildren. Congrats to all of you doing the tough slogging, nothing worth having is easy! And it does get better...it just takes some time. I read a post on the Quit Train earlier.  One of the members forgot to think about smoking recently! She's won a battle, and is on the way to winning the war. I remember that feeling... Forgot to think about smoking...sweet, you just gotta love that/  :)
I just realized the other day that I no longer wake up each day thinking about smoking. That surprises me as that 1st one in the AM was always a focal point for getting the day started. Made me feel really good :)
Great to see you Markus..10 yrs..wow..inspirational..x
I went a whole day last week without thinking about smoking, you're right that was a great feeling.  It is getting easier and easier to push smoking out of my mind.
    Great post 
    It IS a great post Doreen - something all newbies can and should take to heart. Thanks for the bump.
    Agree, great. You can never forget what can happen again if we let it
    Gonna bump this up because it's good, encouraging information for our newbies (and I stalked on Markus when I saw him in celebrations  )    Thanks for giving back!

    It's not just a case of ..!!!!Oh well I'll try again.!!!!.....  I've seen people with good quits ,smoke one or two ...and just carnt get back to quitting for good ,and go back to smoking full blown . It can take years before ,they get in the right frame of mind to try again ...and still fail.....   The only reason a quit fails is because ,folks still believes the  cigarette offers you something...you still believes the lies......   This means you still haven't read and understood the nature of this killer addiction ...    If you carry on smoking ,your more than likely will contract a smoking related illness....some are irreversible......   If your here ...you have a quit .....all you need to do now ,is keep hold of it with everything you have ....   I live with someone who ,if they could would turn back the clock ,and do exactly this ...emphysema is something you don't want ....
A really good post .     The only reason a quit fails is because ,folks still believes the  cigarette offers you something      Thanks for that , Yes , It does not offer anything special .         Nun. By the pen and what they inscribe, (1) You are not, [O Muhammad], by the favor of your Lord, a madman.So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?         Maybe everything else , And it can be dealt with enough time and patience   The point of that is i think not to become self inflicted with some severe affliction , and then be mad about it for the rest of one's life .
    Sorry , A bit out of context . I was typing that for myself
    This is so on point.  We must have control at all times and never think that a cigarette can offer us some magic bullet that will help us thru something or offer positive re-enforcement.  Cigarettes offer nothing and only take away -- I have to remind self of this everyday and why I always go to the NOPE pledge.  Thanks Doreen for this post so that we can remember!!!!
Ok... I have a big failed quit in my past...and I'm talking more than half a decade... so listen up kidlets...1 smoke was all it took..just 1... And then for well over a decade I smoked like a chimney... Sure at the time, in the back of my head, I thought I'd have a couple here and there and quit again easy peasy, I mean I'd already done the quit think for nearly 7 years...NOPE...just as hard, if not harder this time around, and that's on me, because in the back of my mind all the time is the thought that I'm Gunna blow it again and my quit is just on borrowed time. Don't give yourself that whispering voice of self doubt. Don't get me wrong, this quit is it, not smoking ever again but just remember, however easy your quit feels you need to protect it because one smoke really can switch all those nicotine receptors back on in one moment.        Just because you have a failed quit doesn't mean you can't have a successful one. QUIT in Aus tells us that the average is 6 serious quit attempts before you have your forever quit. That is the average, some only need the 1 attempt, some need 20.....whatever your number is you do have one so never give up giving up.       In the same vein don't belittle a failure by calling it a slip, just as you own your successes you need to account for your failures. You smoked, you reset your quit... There are only three questions to answer when you fail:        1. When will I quit again?  2. What were the triggers?  3. What did I learn?
    Thanks Doreen for this great post and reminder how romancing that cigarette leads to danger. I have been rewarding myself and am so amazed how much I have deprived myself by putting so much money in poisoning myself. I have a long way to go but these little rewards are adding up and keeping me motivated. 
As addicts we are all 1 puff away from a pack a day! Once you have put in the hard work to establish your quit it becomes an easy matter of daily maintenance.  Complacency and your addiction whispering however softly in your ear are our enemies. Forever vigilant folks. Edited May 1 by reciprocity

If someone has tried once or twice, there would be that lingering thought, "I still have to try 5 more times..." I remember before my Oct 2017 quit, I had read and heard how nicotine is harder to quit than meth, crack, heroine, glue, Oxycontin, and porn combined. Of course seeing on TV over the years how they portrayed someone quitting any of those, they were flopping around like a fish and screaming.  It makes one think, "what is it gonna be like to quit nicotine?"

Complete and utter disgraceful failure to mankind?       1) I quit after three days. The smoking experience was pretty nasty and I just haven't wanted it since. 2) I have no clue what the trigger was. Usually when I get a crave is when I get real happy or excited. Me and a couple acquaintances have this running joke about Nipsy Hustle's passing, maybe that did it.   3) I learned that smoking is nasty, well, was reminded. I try not to learn new things sine my brain is mostly filled to capacity at this point.

The term "slip" minimizes what has taken place. By taking even 1 puff you have awakened your addiction and given it strength that your hard work over a year and a bit had taken away. I'm sure you are feeling that over these past few days - urges to have "just one more" are no doubt stronger than they have been in months. Statements such as "Complete and utter disgraceful failure to mankind" are simply childish - grow up!         I'm glad you have reaffirmed to yourself that smoking is nasty. That's something positive. I would be concerned about not knowing the trigger that lead you to make the decision to have that first smoke and YES, that was a conscious decision YOU made - no one else. If it was just "a slip" then why did you have 6 cigarettes over 3 days? Why not just the first one, or maybe two?      You have talked a lot over your time here about not wanting to fall victim to some horrible smoking related disease. There's only 1 positive thing you can do to try and avoid that outcome and that is to take quitting seriously. If you don't learn something very significant from this episode then you are bound to repeat it next time something unusual happens.    Remember; it was you that said: " I have no clue what the trigger was."
You know, I am thinking it was probably a bad idea to post about my little relapse. It seems you and a few others here have attacked and blown things out of proportion, like you are glad it happened. Like, "alright! an opportunity to pounce!" Funny thing is, there are three people on here who I would have expected backlash from but were either very polite or said nothing. All three of them I have not been nice to in the past and feel worse about that than anything.   Also -  I smoked 15 years and had quit long before anything crippling happened.     So if 6 cigarettes over 3 days is a "full blown 5 alarm relapse" then what exactly is it when someone quickly relapses to a pack (or more) a day and stays smoking for months or years. For those (except Doreen) who ARE acting like it is your place to decide what I do, exactly why are you so upset about my small relapse? Are you assuming I am sitting here smoking right now or something?
    Where all hear to help ...folks just say it different ....  I have  only seen honest posts ...tryjng to help you and others ,trying to stop further relapses... This is your quit JB .....  Quitting is all about honesty ....it's a addiction ...addicts have to be upfront ...it no use keeping secrets ...if you want honest support back ...    It's sad to see a soldier go down ....it means a battle has been lost ....this also means the war is lost too....   If the board gave you a gentle pat  on the back and said  it doesn't,t matter....what message would this be giving out

Was there a lot of guilt involved? ﻿Was it more ﻿like﻿, "Screw it, I do what I want﻿"?            Honestly...."about bloody time.".... So the second option... Yes there was guilt and shame....the whole time I was quit I never stopped romancing the ciggies...so I craved constantly.         6 hours ago, Jet Black said:                I had﻿ read﻿﻿ and heard how nicotine is harder to quit than meth, ﻿crack, heroine, ﻿﻿glue, O﻿xycontin, and porn combined﻿. ﻿        My opinion....in same was it is, and that's not just big pharma wanting to flog NRTs or quit meds... A nicotine addiction is more than just physical and psychological it has a huge routine aspect to it...you have patterns to you addiction, habits often years old, because to a certain degree smoking is still socially acceptable (it's not against the law)...because it is easy to feed the habit (don't need to break any laws to get a fix)..because it is so ingrained into the rituals that make up our daily lives that is what makes it so hard to quit, you don't just need to detox you need to reprogram. From my person experience, detox from nicotine was easier than alcohol or speed/cocaine but it was not easier to quit as an addiction.
    If JB wants to think of this as a slip or a little relapse that’s her prerogative. On the flip side, people here are entitled to express their belief that you can never have just one.  Those holding that opinion are not personally attacking you - they just feel strongly about how best to defeat this deadly addiction.  Best wishes moving forward JB.   
Back in the day I was very passionate about quitting smoking. There were so many benefits, expected and unexpected, that I wanted every single smoker to break free and feel amazing. I hated cigarettes and what they do to us. I guess it was my passion that has kept me quit for the last 5 years so it can't be a bad thing, right? But oh my. When ever I saw a thread about yet another quitters relapse I had steam coming out my ears. I'd post the brutal truth especially when the relapser had little insight nor had taken any responsibility for their relapse because I knew they were probably never going to keep their quit. And that made me sad for them and for others in the early quit because it would have been scary for them to read how 'easy' it was to relapse. And it almost made a mockery of those that worked their butts off protecting their quit. As if a 'little relapse' was nothing to get your knickers in a knot about. Righto ...        5 years on and I have learned you can't fix other peoples addictions and you can't blame others for their brain wiring. If you have the energy and patience to sooth a relapser then that's wonderful. Everyone deserves support. Even the ones that don't post SOS's. But remember, your time and energy should be focused on YOU and YOUR quit. That's where your passion should be directed towards.
    Thank you Doreensfree for this post!    It and all the responses have helped me more than you know to get immediately back on the right track and take my seat on the Train.

Second, I could care less about "Fanfare". I imagine those who got the most upset and talked crap probably used other NRT stuff after their so-called "quits".  Yeah I talk a lot of crap but I do not personally attack people who relapse.    Funny how I am no where close to being part of the in-crowd of this board yet a few took interest when I posted about a relapse.        And "a" hot dog? Just one? I would be picking up probably three or four. But then I am no vegan.

You are an active member of our community, you are a regular, you have polarising opinions which you readily share and defend (not saying they are wrong just saying not everyone agrees), you are very much a known presence. As a whole we might not always agree with each other, or get each other or even particularly like each other but that doesn't mean the things we each say and do don't impact and leave an impression on others... That goes for all of us.        JB, in all honesty you and I are poles apart on many things and yet had I posted that I'd smoked instead of you l'm pretty sure the reactions would have been the same, it's a shock thing.
Let's get a good discussion going here for the holidays because as another new year is upon us, so are thousands wanting to rid their lives of this crippling and deadly addiction.  We may keep this group discussion going until the end of the year so we get a large sampling of fears, experiences and why these fears are not rooted in fact and instead nicotine (drug) addiction. Many smokers are afraid to quit for various reasons.  There is nothing to fear about quitting but everything to fear about not quitting.  Then there are those who are new to smoking who have irrational fears about staying quit, fear of relapse, fear of failure and even the fear of succeeding. What fears did you have before you made the commitment to N.O.P.E. (not one puff, ever), what did you do to overcome those fears and how do you view those fears today? Once you actually quit smoking, did you have any fears about relapsing and if so, how did you get past them and do those fears still exist? Here a couple of videos for reference, especially for our guests who may be having some fears that are stopping them from making a commitment to N.O.P.E. The Fear Of FailureThis video explains how many people are fearful of even attempting a quit because they are convinced that it is impossible for them to succeed. The attached videos examine the reasons for this fear and will help to illustrate that smokers can quit if they understand the addiction they are fighting and how to take control of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_64RhiVj9Y&list=PLCDB8BA311D538113&index=8 The Fear Of SuccessThis video explains how many people are fearful of attempting a quit because they realize that they may actually succeed. The attached videos examine the reasons for this fear and will help smokers to understand that the fears they have of their lives being ruined are based on the false assumption that cigarettes were helping them to live as opposed to recognizing that smoking was ruining their lives in many ways. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhWSOsWoBE&list=PLCDB8BA311D538113&index=9 The Fear Of RelapsingVideo explains how many people are fearful of even attempting a quit because they are convinced that even if by some miracle they succeed, they will likely lose the quit at some future point in time. This video explains why they may have this fear and what resources we have to deal with it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoWuSG8W_2E Quitting Smoking Out Of FearVideo explains how quitting smoking simply out of fear of it's consequences has its limitations and may make staying off harder than it should be. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpre2NagvY
I was worried that I couldn't quit. I never really tried before. I was also worried that I'd always crave and think about cigarettes. I'm only 5 months in and so far neither is true.  I was also worried that id be bored without them but I find things to do without really trying.  I was also worried about handling emotions without them. This fear took a little longer to over come but I find even if my mind does wander to the thought of smoking, it's a lot easier than I thought to dismiss.  For me, finally getting the guts to Atleast try to quit Got the ball rolling. Then I dealt with each fear as they arose.  Am I afraid of replaspe? I was very early on but since I figured out there are no emotions, events or circumstances besides myself choosing to light and smoke one that can make me relapse I no longer fear it.
For me, I had been a smoker for twice as long as I had been a non smoker. Smoking was part of everything that I did. How could I possibly quit for EVER? I didn't. I just quit for a day.  Then I quit for another. Now, every day, I pledge to take Not One Puff Ever, Just for Today...
Whenever I imagined myself as a non-smoker, I believed that I would be missing out on good times made even better because of smoking.  Going out wouldn't be as enjoyable without cigarettes and the ordinary tasks of daily life would become bland.  The big one for me was smoking while drinking my morning coffee.  I would seriously look forward to going to bed at night because I knew I would soon be drinking coffee and smoking half a dozen cigarettes while my mind and body sparked back to life.  As it turned out, I didn't miss those mornings once I quit and much to my surprise, I enjoyed my mornings much more without smoke in my eyes, the stench on my clean clothes and hair I didn't have to go outside or in the garage and sit on a stool.  I remembered reading about how many people are found dead with a cigarette next to them.  I often thought about that while smoking in the garage and wondered if it would be me. These are just a few of fears/lies that I believed for so long.  More to follow... 1.  I never missed out on anything once I quit.
Quitting always made me so afraid,  scared I would miss the nicotine, miss the cigarette, what would I do without it, I could never see further than that, even the thought of dying from lung cancer, heart failure even those thoughts did not make me want to quit.  I stated smoking at 12 to be part of the gang, thought it made me look cool, I couldnt smell the smoke from me, but I started to feel the effects, the tightening of the chest, the lines deepening of my face, being out of breath walking up the stairs, I started thinking, what if I could be braver than the addiction, what If I could face the addiction head on, I need a little medical intervention to stop my brain from wanting cigarettes, but again so far so good, I have been thinking about cigarettes alot recently, but I keep telling myself, be stronger than the addiction, be braver, don't be afraid of your quit, its making you a healthier, stronger person.  Positive thoughts do go a long way, nicotine addiction is negative thought,
II used to fail because I thought nicotine was a lifeline I couldn't do without so as soo as I got off patches I relapsed. This time will be different. I might post a view SOS's but I rather do that then going back to smoking. I know this point is a dangerous one. I need to get through. STICK to NOPE but it's a really point where I'm gonna be tested, Even now when I'm one step down with patches I'm getting thouhts of smoking. 
I think all smokers at some time or another have/had a fear of quitting.  I feared it for a long long time because I found many excuses to not face it.  I can't quit now because I definitely cannot afford to gain weight; I can't quit now because I have too much stress in my life right now; I can't quit now because I can't afford to feel sick and take time off from work; I can't quit now for....the list can go on and on.  When I was told that diabetic retinopathy was slightly beginning in my eyes and I googled everything I could on how to prevent the escalation of it, everything I read, first thing listed QUIT SMOKING - DON'T SMOKE - STAY AWAY FROM SMOKING.  I was more fearful of going blind than quitting cigarettes, so I made a date and I quit on that day, and I've not looked back.  I still get strong cravings or urges to smoke a cigarette, and every now and then still have dreams of smoking, but when someone who just had a cigarette comes near me and I smell it on them, it disgusts me now just to think that is what I smelled like.  And I probably smelled worse because I smoked at least a pack a day; sometimes slightly more.  It also made me feel terrible; I can see that now since I don't feel like that anymore.  When an individual quits smoking, it is a unique personal journey, and you must be ready in your heart and mind to be successful.  I think before I quit I was actually afraid of relapse, but once I actually quit, it didn't bother me.  Again, I think because I made a plan and stuck to that plan and a date, I had time to lead up to it and prepare myself for what was coming.  I can honestly say that if I can quit smoking, anyone can quit.  I was extremely addicted to my cigarettes, and couldn't imagine my life without smoking.  Now I look back and can't imagine my life as a smoker ever again.
Fear is one of our worse enemies I feel and I think as some get older fear is worse as it creates whole scenarios of why not to do something  When we were kids we were mostly fearless, nervous at Times yes but pretty fearless, we would give things a try Ride a bicycle until the stabilizers came off and we would be  freewheeling downhill Learn to drive until the learner L plates came off Climb a tree one branch at at a time and eventually reach the top The thing is when younger fear was not really an issue or could even have been a motivator? I think regardless we took steps then until we mastered skills and look what fun we had riding  bikes, driving those cars and climbing those trees  Sure I got a few bumps and bruises but the reward at the end was all worth it Taking a chance to see what's on the other side of that fear that's how I quit smoking  realizing fear was what held me back for so many years was half the battle, the rest as they say is history, education, support and determination was the  other half of the battle One that anyone could win!
what if I fail? Well, if you try to quit and then relapse...you are back where you would be anyway. No loss. It is the 21st century. We can no longer pretend in the modern world that we do not understand the dangers of smoking. There is no rational reason to continue smoking. I feared failing. I had failed before.  But actually, there is nothing to fear. No one is forcing me to quit. I choose to smoke or not to smoke. So, if I make a choice to smoke, it is a choice, not a failure. So, no fear.  I have made a choice not to smoke. Just for today.  There is nothing to fear.  Why not choose not to smoke today? It's not as tough as you might think.
I agree with you all and, looking back, it is ridiculous! How can a fear of failure stop me from even trying?! But it did, so many times... I was also afraid of being bored - smoking stopped me being bored (yeah, right). I also thought that smoking helped control my stress levels (again, lol at that). So I think that once I figured out that these were all lies that I was telling myself, to enable me to carry on smoking without feeling guilty (how can I feel guilty, I'm an ADDICT?), that was a real turning point. To keep quit, I always took it a day at a time. And I took strength from others that had quits similar or longer than me - I looked up to them. But I also took strength (and this is horrible to say) from people who relapsed - I saws people who had been quit longer than I had, giving in and smoking. And I saw these same people fail again, and again... I saw how difficult it was for people to quit again after a relapse, and I was not going to be that person, no way! This place and my friends gave me the strength to keep the quit in times of need, and I hope to repay the favour whenever necessary.
I'm a Life long smoker...52  years....i thought I would probably die a smoker.... Fear kept me from even imagining I could have a life with out my crutch...I couldn't possibly live with out them.....could I.....Oh yes I can...I can have the best life I could ever imagine....Early in my quit ..I was told by the old timers ...stay strong ....the magic will happen....It sure does....Being a part of this group has been the most wonderful time of my life....I now live my life living with a daily n.o.pe...And I've never been happier....
When I was younger I didn't see anything wrong with smoking.  Why quit as I enjoyed them!  I also thought they were a stress reliever!  As more and more things were blamed on them, my children begged me to quit as they got the facts at school.  By then I was very afraid to even try to quit as I just knew I couldn't do it.  Years later I decided I really wanted to quit.  I think that is the key - really wanting to quit.  I put my last one out in the evening and the next morning made it several hours without one and knew I pretty well had it licked at that point.  I was one that as soon as my feet hit the floor I was out the back door for a smoke.  I won't say it was the easiest thing I have done but it sure was a lot easier than I expected.  I still get an urge ever so often but it just last for a second.  All you have to do is NOPE!!!

    Bump for newbies !!!
I wrote this on another forum today, but I thought it worth re-writing here, mostly because this is the biggest lesson I needed to learn to finally make my quit stick. I may need to re-read it in the days to come...     I hear a lot of people say that stress caused them to return to smoking. I get it. I used that reasoning in the past, too. But it was just an excuse to feed my addiction. I see that now.      If you think there will ever be an easy, stress-free time to quit, you are wrong. While we may experience periods of low stress, life will always throw curveballs at us. Illness happens. Death happens. Jobs are lost. New jobs are begun. Relationships hit the rocks. We move. We travel. We work. We live.     Life can be hard. But it's no excuse to start smoking again.        Believe me, I understand stress. I suffer from severe bipolar disorder. I was recently diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease that can affect the heart and lungs. (I saw a cardiologist for the first time yesterday.) I am currently watching my dearest friend die from acute liver failure. (It's an extremely ugly way to go. She's suffering horribly. She's only 41 years old.)        I'm living through one of the most stressful periods in my life. And I'm doing it smoke free. I chose to quit during a stressful period, because I needed to learn that stress is no excuse to smoke. And right now, each day that I remain smoke free, I am solidifying this truth in my mind.     I am freeing myself. Finally. It's been an uphill climb, but every single step has been worth it.       Don't wait to quit. And don't give yourself an excuse to start again.       Smoking won't eliminate stress from our lives. It just won't. And it won't help us cope, either. Once we learn that, we are truly free.Edited March 5 by abbynormal

    Thank you Abby for such an honest and open post. I'm sure you sharing this will help many more to come. You are doing great and should be so proud of yourself. And again, I'm really sorry about your friend 
    Thank you for sharing Abby....I'm sure it will help lots of folks ....The first thing we did ,when we faced stress was reach for our crutch ... We believed it helped us cope better ....it was in truth the exact opposite.....    You have come along way and got over that big hurdle ...    My thoughts to you and your your friend ......
    Thank you Abby for your post.   I am so sorry for your friend.  Smoking did nothing for us. NOTHING.    Dealing with stress in a clear and clean way is the way forward and much easier without the stress of addiction.
    You're right Abby. We all have stress at some point during our quits so using stress as a reason to start smoking again is just an excuse. I used smoking to avoid dealing with the life issues that caused the stress. Smoking never reduced that stress - just allowed me to avoid dealing with life for a while. Once you've truly realized that smoking does not relieve stress, you have made a huge leap forward to achieving life long freedom from this addiction.
    On point Abby, on point.  Stress is there and will always be there but it is not an excuse for smoking -- that will only make things worse.  For the last two months I have gone thru some very stressful times from a death in the family, health issues, and housing issues (as well as some very strange family issues) and let me tell you I almost used the stress from all that to pick up a smoke again.  With grace I realized that smoking would not solve the stress -- not even make it feel a little bit better, so after a little more than a year quit I think I realized that even though I have to remain vigilant I believe I now have the upper hand in this quitting thing.  During the quit process we have to remember that curve balls are going to thrown at us!!!!
    Wow, Abby. Now you know that there is nothing you can't do because you've had so much thrown at you at once and are managing to get through it gracefully, no matter how painful it may be at times.  Thank you for your post which may very well help put things in perspective for someone who is struggling with starting or maintaining a quit; and thank you for being there for your friend when she needs you the most.  I wish you the very best with getting your health issues under control, and have no doubt that cigarettes no longer stand a chance against you.  
    I'm in awe of you. I can't even handle stress regardless of smoking or not.         Sounds like you have got this well and truly figured out and will never smoke again.

    I want to thank you ALL for the positive thoughts and prayers for my friend. I'm a little late in doing so, and I apologize for that. But each one of you who offered your kind words did much to soothe my sad heart. ❤

    Thank you abbynormal for this post. I had noted it in my journal (this was before I joined the forum) because I'm not good at dealing with stress and that was always my excuse for smoking again. You've proven no matter what, stress can be handled without smoking. I will keep coming back to this thread.         I'm sorry about your friend and the difficult health issues you continue to face yourself. But you can be proud you're doing it without smoking and that you're helping more people than you realize by sharing your quit story.         
Yesterday had dr appt. Blood pressure was 140/90, up from 120/60 three months ago, up from my normal 112/62.   I felt a knot of fear in my stomach when she told me.        According to the American Stroke Association, that is stage 2 hypertension and in stroke range. (Other organizations have their own ideas of how they define stages.)       Later in the day my 5 year old granddaughter came over. We went to the park and I taught her how to fly a kite.  I thought to myself, "it is unthinkable to keep smoking when it could kill me or cause a stroke, and rob my granddaughter of having her grandmother in her life."      I don't know why I have such trouble staying quit. It's possible that it's affected by being bipolar and going from elation to despair in cycles. Terrible lack of self-discipline and poor impulse control. I told the psychiatrist who monitors my meds that I want to start meeting with her to learn how to strengthen  impulse control and stop this destructive way of being. I want a productive life, not just existence with smoking-caused diseases as my future.     I'm glad the QT is here, online, and I apologize for the lack of commitment and follow through. Truly, I am trying to get this right.
    Sorry you are having additional health issues but at least it has kept you aware of your nicotine addiction and the fact that you really need to tackle that to give yourself the best chance for better health in your future. I'm glad you are seeking help from your medical people. I'm sure your bipolar issue adds a significant complication to the quit process. I wish you the very best in getting some direction from your Dr. on that. Quitting really will be a huge step forward to a better future for you.
    Hey Kate sorry to hear about this.  Work with your doctor on your BP, they can really help with that.  For years my doctor was trying to get me to quit due to blood work and high BP.  Finally I had a sit down with her and my nurse and they were blunt and realistic -- I took it from there and hear I am now.  I will always have to take BP meds but since I have quit and changed some of my other lifestyles my BP is well controlled and a reduction in meds has happened.  I can relate about your granddaughter, I came to the same realization about my grandson since we are so close.  You have some good reasons for sticking with your quit at this time and as you improve use that as your motivation.  Welcome back and come back often -- you can get it right this time!!!!!
    Glad you're back to quitting Kate while your blood pressure is still in an easily manageable place. Hopefully that's the motivation you finally need to conquer this addiction. Stay close and reach out when you feel yourself caving to a crave. You owe that to yourself and who knows maybe these fine people can help you past it and you will save your quit  
Thanks to both of you, Martian5 and Reciprocity. I made myself a poster this morning and posted it prominently on my refrigerator. I feel a bit foolish sharing it, but what the heck.  The "Daily Dozen" at the bottom of the page refers to Dr. Michael Greger's Daily Dozen free app to keep track of his recommended foods each day.        After getting the news about my eyes a few weeks ago (mild cataracts and early-stage glaucoma), and now the rise in blood pressure, I am back to a whole plant foods diet that I began a few months ago. I found Greger while searching around Youtube for videos of Rip Esselstyn and the whole foods diet he promotes. Both Greger's and Esselstyn's stories are interesting, as are the results they say are achieved by ditching animal and processed foods, such as normalizing blood pressure, reversing heart disease, returning to a healthy weight, etc. Both back their recommendations on clinical evidence reported in thousands of articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals.       We'll see. My blood pressure is too high, I am now 21 lb overweight since changing to a sedentary job last year, and I am in a fight to protect my vision.  Smoking does not solve any of those problems. Never has, never will, and I'll keep drilling that point into my thick skull until it's anchored for good.     High blood pressure april 29 2019.pdf
    Kate, whishing you all the best from The rainy Netherlands. I admire you for researching your health/food, putting the poster on your fridge (I did the same with a letter, but for a different reason). My mental health is improving and I am really starting to experience a new calm. I believe quitting makes the mess in my head easier to bear, proof is piling up especially for the last couple of weeks. I whish the same for you and I know you can do this, despite everything. I bet you are a strong person.       Hang in there!
    Kate thanks for posting your "refrigerator" information, I am going to look that information up to see if it will help me.  Looks like you are establishing a good plan!!!!
    I'm sorry to hear about your blood pressure, Kate, but I am glad you are back at quitting smoking.  Going smoke free should really help your BP and many other aspects of your health.      Stick close and reach out if you need help.  Quitting for good would be the best thing you can possibly do at this point.
Eight months done and dusted. Its been 25°C for some days now, probably too hot for this time of the year. I am so happy that it doesnt affect me at all: it means I did a good job dealing with these craves last summer, when I quit. In terms of seasonal triggers, I think I am safe to say Ive had the worst. Pretty uplifting idea!   Time is starting to speed up. I dont know how to describe it, but thoughts of smoking are turning into soft whispers in the background and the days that I hardly think about it are adding up. Its facinating, because I know Ive been working towards this and yet it strikes me as, well, relief? That it really was true, what everyone here said? And that it also works for me..? Working on it, fighting for it, studying on it, all that hard work is starting to really, really pay off now. More and more I am able to let go of holding on to quitting, if that makes sense. Ofcourse I could make a giant list of pro's, but right now these are the most important:    * I saved money for more than half a piano (hence the picture). * I save and still have extra money to spend in daily life, which makes me feel more independant.   * I feel so much better physicaly, its shocking.    * I take care of myself way better. What started as time biding and routine changing, became daily rituals: making ginger tea instead of coffee in the morning, tooth picking/brushing 3 times a day and discovering all sorts of new toothpaste, deep breathing (only managed to do that since i was at 6+ months. So glad I kept trying, its brilliant) and last but not least: slowing down when I am tired, mourning when I experience loss and need to proces and cheering myself up when I know thats what I gotta do (I used to be the person to sít in my sadness, put on Nick Drake and drown myself in it).   I really hope this helps you, if youre struggeling at the moment. Things will be better. Every day, even every minute is part of the bigger story. You WILL feel good again, you WILL feel proud eventually and you are doing this for a reason. Cling to it, write it down. Do what you need to, when you need to do it and know that there is never ever a genuine reason why you could not become a nonsmoker.    Edited April 24 by MLMR
All I can say is good for you, sticking to it and reaping the benefits.  You put into words what I felt last fall as I had completed my 8th month.  It sneaks up on you but then it hits you hard that this is doable.  Job well done and thanks for the post - it really shows that not only can it be done but it is so well worth it!!!!!!
    Love this post @MLMR......  Don't look now !!!!!.....The magic is happening ....It was lovely to read ....x  
    MLMR you have such an amazing way with words.  I feel the same but just could not find the words to express my feelings. I know smoking is a thing of my past and will never again be a part of my future.      I feel like a different person.  A healthier person.    That piano looks awesome.  Keep saving those pennies.
    This post just makes my day. I really hope you copy it into your other post so that people following your journey see the end result.        
    Love this post MLMR, so glad you're doing so well now. I have no doubt that this post will help many people know that they too can be successful

    I love when this happens for people; happened to me at about eight months as well.  I gained a stronger sense of empathy and understanding at this point of ending my nicotine addiction.
    It's posts like this that make me realize I can do this! I need to simply put my head down and keep marching...(someone posted something like this?)

    Awesome post and great to know you're doing well!!!
    Great post MLMR, well written.
    This post is great. Can’t wait to get to this stage. Congratulations and thanks !!!
    I have read here somewhere that after quitting it's possible that meds for high blood pressure may be lowered or eliminated. I think it was Martian who had his meds lowered. I do have a doctors appt in May and will have my bp checked and discuss this with my doctor then but has anyone else here experienced lower bp after quitting?  How long after quitting does this usually happen?  Would love to eventually not have to take them. 
Did not happen in my case...actually blood pressure med was upped a bit after CABGx3 bypass surgery last year due to my coronary artery disease.
I think mine dropped a little but nothing significant.  I believe mine is now typically 140/90 and probably 145/90 when I smoked. Not sure exactly but it wasn't much.      I think raised blood pressure is a short term effect of smoking. Depending on the source, it takes between 20 minutes and 24 hours for BP to drop.      Of course they keep lowering the number of what is "safe" so they can sell more BP meds. That part has nothing to do with smoking and more about them pushing meds.
    Yes it was I whose BP dropped.  My doctor stated that quitting smoking was a big part in that.  My BP had gone to the low side so we lowered the meds.  Also my walking had improved and that will also help lower BP  Now remember everyone is different.  I would continue to monitor your BP and then discuss with your doctor (of course they will also probably add that exercise and diet will also help -- but hey I did that also).
    My blood pressure didn't get lower either. But I'm not as active as I should be because of my asthma. 
    Thanks everyone. Martian I too have started to be more active and am trying to eat healthier. Going to the gym now and these things help. I will keep an eye on bp and talk to Dr when I see him next month. 
    I know I've been pretty quiet lately. I'm still here! My quit is still very much intact. I've been lurking but not posting much. I'm going through some very overwhelming health stuff, and my mind is on overload.     The thought of smoking popped into my mind briefly a couple of days ago. I dismissed that thought immediately. My autoimmune disease is affecting my lungs, and the thought of breathing in anything other than clean air is repugnant to me now. But the stress...the stress is the trigger. Thank goodness I am strong enough to say "NO!" when the Nicodemon whispers in my ear. Even with all I am going through, I can still say no to smoking.        You can, too. I promise.
    So happy to hear from you Abby. Sounds like your dealing with difficult health issues.  Know that I am praying for you.     You definitely want to hang onto that quit.  Smoking would probably make your lung issues worse.  Please keep us up on everything.  We care!
    I'm sorry to hear about your struggles, Abby, but am glad you are keeping your quit.  Stay strong, Abby.  We really care for you.
    Great to hear from you Abby.  Sorry about the health issues, I know the stress that can add to your life.  It looks like you have the right attitude and are keeping strong.  Prayers are with you!!!

    Good to hear from you Abby, I sure hope the pulmonologist will be able to do something to help you. I know how it feels to not be able to breath  I'm thinking positive thoughts for you, xoxoImagine how much harder it would be if you hadn't made the decision to quit 
    Your quit family here cares about you Abby and it saddens us to hear you are dealing with the health struggles you are having to deal with but you have done the most important thing you could possible do in terms of your lung function by quitting smoking. Stay strong and let us know how things are going.
    Glad you are still here, Abby! Yes, the health issues can be overwhelming at times (don't I know it!)... but remember that your quit has made you stronger than ever!   Stay positive...
    Thanks to everyone here, this is were you belong. This is the best support group and if you stick around you will succeed. 
A few things really caused me to quit. One being the fact that I could not laugh like a jack-ass when I found something comical. I would try to laugh and end up nearly choking.    I would try to sleep but had to cough a certain way so my breath would quit rattling. I got pissed off at the cigarettes.   But yeah, when I realized I was getting better, it was the first night in 15 years I fell asleep with NO rattle noises. It was also when I could laugh loud and obnoxiously again without coughing.     You know thing that isn't discussed much but when I did smoke, I felt pretty guilty. I would buy something nice, maybe a new outfit, or whatever. The thought I often had was, "How long til cigarette smoke ruins this?"
When the stains faded from my fingers and my toes looked normal again.  My toes were bright red year-round.  I always though it was because of severe frostbite that I suffered as a teenager.  That was not the case.  Smoking effected my blood circulation.  After a few weeks off of the cigarettes, my toes were normal skin color.  And a lot warmer too!Edited April 22 by Pearlie
I had a lung test performed at the doctor when he prescribed my Chantix (I was still smoking at the time) and the results were pathetic.        Not wheezing when going to bed and not having to clear my throat all the time after a few days was cool, but the real eye opener was when I went back to the Dr. six (smoke free) weeks later, my lung capacity was somewhere around, 200% better.       Edited April 22 by JimHannoonen
When I could walk up the hill from the lake, 200yards, without huffing and puffing. Also when I stopped coughing all, night, long.      P.S. Hey Jim!    Edited April 22 by NOPEster
    Back in the fall when I could smell autumn in the air and could walk more than a mile, then the Doctor saying I had to reduce some of my blood pressure medications since it was going to low -- that was the mark!!!!
I’ve gone almost 3 years without getting those painful skin cracks on the tips of my fingers, plus my toes aren’t always freezing in winter.   I think I could walk barefoot in the snow nowEdited April 22 by Wayne045
    When I stopped coughing my lungs up. This recovery happened so fast, within a week.
    Within two weeks ,that awful painful dull sore ache had gone from both ankles ..I had stopped scratching them to ease the pain ...
My constant coughing stopped after about a week...the terrible phlegm production after two weeks...and the problems with my eyes cleared up almost immediately and they were no longer bloodshot....God, I didn't realize what a mess I was! My messed up arteries took surgery to clear up and I have been dealing with that issue since the day I quit!       PS Just had my one year anniversary last week since my CABGx3 surgery...got the thumbs up from cardiologist...echo normal, ekg normal, blood-work normal. What a relief...I can get back to my gardening with no restrictions!

    Sarge knew by the end of his second day he would never smoke again.     The first day? Not so much.         EZPZ. 
    Sorry its been awhile but this quit has not been easy for me so I took a break from posting. I continue to watch videos and spend a lot of time reading at whyquit. Things are slowly easing up...certainly not as difficult as those first few weeks. My anxiety has eased up which is a blessing in itself. However, staying away from the boards is not a solution when quitting. So I will be more active. Started to exercise a bit and need to quit stuffing my face. Moving along and am staying strong. 
I just joined desperate1 and quit smoking not quite 2 hours ago. You're already helping me by stating your anxiety has eased up. I've let my anxiety get the best of me in the past which only leads me back to smoking. Which for me, creates even more anxiety. Craziness...
Glad you are back D1 and even happier you are still rockin' your quit
    Welcome and so glad that I have helped. My anxiety was horrible and I had to really fight in the beginning to keep the quit so I know where you are coming from. Hang in there cause eventually your mind set adjusts to the fact that smoking is off the table.  Keep fighting and things will ease up slowly but surely. We can do this. 
Hi desperate1, it's good to see you  I'm glad that your anxiety is easing. Quitting was very hard for me too but I found that for me staying glued to the forum kept my mind busy and not centered on smoking. Plus being able to support others is such a reward in itself no matter how far along in our quits we are So fyi, a couple of the 2019 quitters decided on Ashkickers for your class name and notsmokinjo designed an awesome logo, below, for your signatures
    Thanks Jillar. Love the logo and the name.  Yes staying close to the boards does help and sure makes the time go quicker. Nice to see you. 
Glad to see that you are still hanging in there desperate1!
    So happy to see you’re still quit. Congratulations!!
    Great news D.....   Join in the fun ..Quitting doesn't have to be all doom and gloom ...play some games.....look at the funny cats and dogs ....the days will pass more quicker with company ...
    Happy to know that you've stuck to your quit!!!
    So happy you are still quit and have returned to the forum.  Yes, anxiety is a tough part of quitting but you do not have to go it alone.  We have all been there.      You have done the tough stuff now.  The rest is a matter of redirecting your thoughts.  It gets easier every day.  
    Thanks everyone. Damn anxiety sleeping patterns all over the place. Just so mad at myself for even smoking at all. Still think of them and want it all to just go away. Too much romancing them. Read and watched so many videos my eyes hurt. Time to stop the pity party and be glad I made it this far. Thanks for all the encouragement. You all are so appreciated. 
That's right D1. We can't change those stupid decisions we made back when we started smoking. What's done is done. Now we just gotta pull ourselves up by the boot-straps and put in the time and hard work required to get us to the point where we can manage any thoughts we might have of smoking easily. We can't make it like we never smoked but ... we can commit to never smoking again
    Anxiety is horrible so big congratulations for sticking to your quit. 
My sleep was all over the place for a while ...I couldn't sleep ..I was in the board 24/7....but soon enough it went back to normal .   Remember all what you are feeling is temporary ....you just have to ride the waves ...
    I go for a daily walk around the block with my dog. Today we were almost home when I saw something in the middle of the sidewalk, a full pack of cigarettes! I stared at it in my hand for some time. Then I put them in a nearby mailbox and kept on walking. I guess I didn't trust myself to throw them away at home. 
    Good job kdad but I would love to see the reaction of the person who's mailbox you put them in lol
    Great job, shows the quit is really starting to stick now.  Good for now taking them home, not sure about the mail box unless that person smokes, but hey you passed the test!!!
    Great job, the main thing is you didn’t take them home 
    Great job, Kdad. 
You got this Kdad.  It is only forward from here!
Good job! I bet this resonated with you in terms of just how strong your quit has become. It's a great feeling and these are the moments we remember about our quit journeys  Edited April 22 by reciprocity

    Gotta love that.  The same thing happened to me early in my quit except I wasn't walking a dog, just myself.  Without thinking, I took all of the cigarettes out of the pack and threw them in a creek.  Unusual for me because I am very against littering.  I hope the person whose mailbox you put them in is not a recent quitter.  Imagine that!
What brand were they?  Good job on not smoking. I think if it had been me,  I likely would have given in depending on the brand. Just hope the universe doesn't decide to test you during a particularly weak time.

This is an interesting article about how tobacco companies are realizing people are quitting smoking and they need to hook people another way.          Philip Morris needs to kill smoking to survive ://a.msn.com/00/en-us/BBW2w7D?ocid=se
    And the big tobacco companies continue to march on and reap profits thru inflicting damage/injury to others.  I am so sad I ever fell into their trap.  I can only go forward and let others know the dangers, I do this by speaking to my grandchildren and they do listen -- they only have to look to me to see the damages!!!!
    They are fighting for their corporate survival in any and all ways they can, no matter who they hurt or kill along their way .... like they always have.    The Who did a song called; Won't Get Fooled Again! There was a lyric near the end of that song "meet the new boss, same as the old boss" - applies very much to big tobacco unfortunately   
    The one thing that gets to me now....is how I fell into the trap...the lies...for all those years ...   I'm angry at the tobacco companies ....and I'm  more angry at myself....    I hate them....
    When we were young, they made smoking look so appealing.  All the movie stars smoked and romanticized it.   I am ashamed of my foolishness.  I am hoping we can teach the younger generations.

Just yesterday I was reading a list of famous people (a lot of them movie/TV stars) who died of smoking related diseases; mostly lung cancer. The list went on and on and on. I couldn't even get to the end of it. It's amazing. When you watch those old TV shows and they are all happily smoking away ...... little did they know then that they were facilitating their own early demise. I remember a lot of them were between 60-70 when they died but some even a lot younger. It's shocking to look at those statistics.     I too am angry with tobacco companies but most;y at myself for ignoring the facts once they were made available to us. Regret does nothing positive though so all we can do is protect our own quits and do what we can to encourage others to take the step to freedom.Edited April 18 by reciprocity

Was it not just part of the times though? I mean where I grew up it was smoking cigarettes, drinking, and just generally being Johnny bad ass. And in my case I started driving trucks in the oil field's and smoked to stay awake all night. I mean... were we really duped? My  mom and dad smoked and I don't know why, but I was the only one out of 4 that picked up the nasty habit. I wish I never would have but it is what it is. I only have myself to blame, I do wish I could lay it on someone else but I have to suck it up. All we can do is move forward and try to make the best of our situation now.

I agree 100% with @Wantsit, I'm not going to hate the tobacco companies for something I chose to do. We have to take responsibility for our own actions.....

Bad news: A friend has been diagnosed (just this past Monday) with small cell lung cancer with brain metastases...very bad news, indeed. Smoked 2 packs a day for over 40+ years (she had quit about 4 years ago.)      Good news: My nephew has started on Chantix this month as he wants to quit smoking...says I am a good example for him!
    I'm sorry about your friend @Rozuki  And very happy that your nephew is quitting. It must feel good to be the example for him that quitting is possible

People at school smoked as did my mum.      I smoked through choice and I have to take responsibility for my own actions. I continued to do it even though I knew the risks.        Electronic cigarettes are a big market and tobacco companies are a business. From that perspective it makes sense that they go where the money is.
    As everyone knows I don't have anything against e-cigarettes.  Hadn't heard of the one in Linda's article so looked it up. This is a really long article so it might put you off reading it but in a nutshell it looks like there are whispers that their reports on how great this product is are a bit *cough* inaccurate.     https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tobacco-iqos-science/
@Rozuki I am so sorry about your friend. Hearing stories like this always make me wonder if I will get my life back or still suffer from the effects of smoking so long.  I do hope your nephew can follow your lead.
    I'm sorry too @Rozuki to hear the sad news about your friend ...    I often wonder if I have dodged the bullet ...but I intend to enjoy what life I have left ....smoke free.....   Your nephew has a great role model ..

Sadly for some of us we may have left it too late, but for many of us we have avoided that one ciggie that was the cincher....but for me when I got sick early in my quit and I faced treatment and I thought about smoking, (I mean what was the point in staying quit I was already sick), but you know what...I want to leave this life free of an addiction that controls me....I want to go out the master of myself.   @Rozuki I'm sorry for you and your friend.         So I despise big tobacco, but not because I was stupid enough to buy their lies...that's all on me...I'm angry with them because they think it's acceptable to profit from making people sick, they know the product they sell addicts the users, they know the product hurts and kills them and yet they see no issue continuing to profit from others misery, even innocent bystanders...that's what pissed me off. They know and they don't care...they want people addicted...just don't know how they look at themselves in the mirror and say "I'm good people".
@notsmokinjo I can't quote on my cell phone but what you said about getting sick and not giving in to going back to smoking says a lot.  I always was so ashamed that I smoked through breast cancer.  I would run in for my 15 min. radiation and then leave and light up.  Looking back it was kind of defeating the purpose.  That was not enough to scare me off cigarettes.    I am not looking back.  I am only going forward with the hopes of gaining as much life as I can.
@Linda Thomas but at the time, when you were fighting a battle for your life you weren't in the position emotionally to stage a war on two fronts....at the time the battle of the pink ribbon was the one that counted....but you are a different person now than then....now the time is right for this battle.
So﻿ I despise big tobacco, but not because I was stupid enough to buy their lies...that's all on me...I'm angry with them because they think it's acceptable to profit from making people sick, they know the product they sell addicts the users, they know the product hurts and kills them and yet they see no issue continuing to profit from others misery, even innocent bystanders...that's what pissed me off.

How can you justify ,knowing millions have died because of your product....and you are targeting children .....beggars belief ..... Dirty money ...

Phillip Morris makes the nastiest cigarettes out there anyways. Taste like bleach. Bunch of crooks. Even when I smoked I hated anything PM. I still do give to tobacco and nicotine companies though. Yeah, I give them the bird.           On 4/18/2019 at 1:51 PM, Martian5 said:             And the big tobacco companies continue to march on and reap profits thru inflicting damage/injury to others.  I am so sad I ever fell into their trap.  I can only go forward and let others know the dangers, I do this by speaking to my grandchildren and they do listen -- they only have to look to me to see the damages!!!!              Don't feel too bad.

The education about the harmful effects of smoking was there then as it is now.     I stand by my first post, I chose to smoke. Sirius said it best, tobacco has a right to sell shovels. Oh and to quote Chris Rock, 'Dont hate the player, hate the game'.
I hate big tobacco because I have a type A personality and am an addict. Funny thing I am going on six months and have more craves now than I did at three. I wish I could jump in your time machine and go back to about about 40 years and just say NOPE! Just saying.
No Man's Land. Repost for jhhawaii      By tahoehal  on May 13 2008 at 5:54 pm  77, Male    Las Vegas   NV, United States   Member Since: September 01 2004 « Previous Entry  Next Entry »      I seldom start a post, unless it is to honor someone's anniversary. But I feel compelled to share something that I seem to be sharing a lot of lately... and that is my thoughts on 'No Man's Land'. No Man's Land is a dangerous and scary place... and it is a lonely time during a quit. I call No Man's Land that period of time between about 1 month and 3 or 4 months into your quit, or about the time from the end of your first month.. This is a time when many people slip and go into a full relapse and have to start over... if they can start over, that is. I have some observations that may help some of you who are literally hanging on by your fingernails... or who may find yourself there tomorrow.    The first month is an exhausting but exhilirating experience... you are locked in nearly daily struggles and you get the satisfaction of successfully beating your addiction that day. You go to bed a WINNER each night (as Troutnut would say), and you are justifiably proud of yourself. Your friends and family are also supportive as they see you struggling each day to maintain your quit. And you are being constantly supported here, whether or not you post... just being here is good for your quit. And so, the battles are won and it actually becomes easier and the battles occur less often as you finish 30 days or so. Around 60 days, you're starting to have some really good days, with very few craves and some nice insights about yourself... but then again, you still have some bad days. Those bad days can really be depressing... you begin to wonder if you're ever gonna be able to relax. Your junkie is whispering to you, telling you that 'just one' won't hurt. You've conquered your daily triggers, but now you start trippiing over the occasional ones... a death in the family, unexpectedly bad news, money problems, health problems, going on a long car ride, a trip to the bar, or whatever. You have a strong crave and you begin to doubt your ability to keep your quit.    In addition, the 3D support that you used to get is pretty much gone... non-smokers figure you should be 'over it' by now, smokers don't like to hang around you much because they feel guilty and addicted (remember that feeling?), and people who have quit may not remember just how much love and support you need well into the first few months. They all think you should be 'over it', you think you should be 'over it'... and the temptation is to have 'just one' to see if you ARE over it.    But of course you're not over it, are you? That 'just one' whisper becomes much much louder and becomes 'just one more'... and each time you give in to that whisper, the craves come harder and sooner. The one way to guarantee that your craves will never go away is to light up, to slide that old cigarette needle into your arm and shoot up. Those craves will be back and keep coming back. But if you protect your quit, your craves will eventually weaken and become even fewer and farther between.    As you get to around 100 days or so (some will be a bit longer)... you will begin to really get a healthy perspective on your addiction. You will see the huge role that smoking played in your life, you will see clearly what that addiction really cost you. And you will understand that it was a very high price to pay... the loss of your confidence, your emotions, your self-control... your SELF. All enslaved to your addiction. And you will begin to see that you can look forward to a non-smoking future without romanticizing your addiction. You see it clearly for the life-stealing evil it was... and is. You see a much different future for yourself than your past has been. And it no longer scares the crap out of you to think that you are done smoking... in fact, you embrace that thought with joy every day. But you have to get out of No Man's Land first. How can you help yourself? And how can those of us who have been through it help you?   First of all, you need to understand that you aren't alone. If you haven't already done so, make a pinky-finger promise with 2 or 3 good quitbuds and exchange phone numbers with them. Promise to call them if you're ever in trouble, and make them promise the same. These are your 'life and death' quitbuddies... you are literally trusting each other with your lives. Then call them... often. Just to see how they are doing, and to tell them you're doing well too. Be totally honest with them, this is life and death. Second, understand that you're going to have some unexpectedly bad days... but they are going to be further apart. Shrug them off, laugh your way through them, call your quitbuddies... whatever it takes to get through them without smoking. Some battles will be easy, some will be hard. Come here and post, send qmail, exercise, learn to cook, take up a new hobby. Whatever it takes, keep going to bed a WINNER each night.   Third, ask some of the older qsters to keep an eye on you... to contact you to see how you're doing. I have been asked to do that for several of you recently and I am happy to do that, as I am sure that others are too. We know that you just need to hold on a little bit longer and change your focus just a little to make that breakthrough. And then you will OWN your quit, and it will be a very comfortable thing.   Last, take a deep and honest look at your past life... your life as a smoker and compare it to what your life is like now... and what it will be like in the future. You have to develop that vision of your future, of the person that you are going to BECOME now that you have freed yourself. You have to believe in yourself. You have to love yourself enough to deny yourself your addiction.    No Man's Land doesn't have to be so lonely and scary and dangerous. You need some company and some courage and some faith in yourself. And when you emerge from it, you will not be the same person that entered it.    Never never never question your decision to quit! This is the most loving thing that you will ever do for yourself. A few days of discomfort in exchange for a lifetime of freedom. You will never find another deal like it.   Protect your quit. Don't smoke, no matter what. Hal 08-20-2004  A puff is too much, a thousand cartons are not enough.
    I vacillate between thinking NML is a "thing" and thinking it's just another excuse that relapsed folks use.  I know I FELT those things, and still do occasionally, but think it's more our inner addict messing with our minds.       Still think it's a good post and explanation!
    Excellent post. I it a thing, or an excuse? I do not believe it is either. Just like the long list of symptoms. You may have some, but seldom all. It's a possible condition. It was very strong for me. It led me to write. It concerned me. But I didn't relapse, so it wasn't an excuse. Just something else to be aware of so you are prepared for it if it comes your way.     I love this post Nancy. 
Oh god I'm only in week 3 but I've already hit no-man's land, I think because not everyone in my life even knew I smoked, and I never smoked that much, so people definitely think I should be over it by now. I will definitely be needing this place lol
@Ren my never smoker hubby thought I should be over it too after only a couple months. People who don't smoke can't understand. That's why my support forum was/is so important to me

Hiya. In 12 hours I’ll be 4 weeks smoke free. Still having “moments” though not as often, they seem to increase in intensity and duration. Still taking it 1 day at a time. Emotions still swinging from very proud to very depressed but hope this will settle soon. Good news is the brain fog’s gone but left a short temper/snarky tongue which is taking some managing lol.    Am having issues posting on here - not sure why . I can like posts but can’t always post comments- this is the first time I’ve been able to in over a week- you should all be grateful for that
As far as not smoking is concerned, all good so far. I will complete two smoke free weeks tomorrow, 15th April, 11:30 PM. Just sticking to my daily pledge of "Nope". Out of habit, the thought that its time for a smoke after eating still occurs sometimes and then I remember I'm smoke free and just forget about smoking. I drank Rum yesterday and did get triggered (for a very short while) for a cigarette but I did not smoke.    @Doreensfree I'm assuming the part about being nosy was a joke.Edited April 14 by Ankush
Glad to hear you two are doing OK and still on track with your quits! Readjusting to life as "normal" really does take quite awhile but you are both doing well and experiencing completely normal quit symptoms and yes Dizzy .... they will all correct themselves eventually. I know the one that took the longest for me was that hair-trigger temper thing - lol. They will all correct themselves though in time. Just keep moving forward because it doesn't get harder, it only gets easier the more time you spend not smoking. And, as you get past that 1st month or so be aware that you are entering what is referred to as "no man's land". Sounds daunting right? It's not really. It's just that period where the newness of your quit has worn off and things start becoming a bit of a chore at times. There's a post about it around here somewhere. I've included the link below for you. If you can't open the link, this post is on this same page below this Newbies Post. It's always good to be aware in advance what you can expect to experience so you don't think anything is abnormal with what you are going through. We all experience similar things and in the end, we all make it out the other side as permanent non smokers. Just keep adhering to NOPE!    Edited April 14 by reciprocity

I think I am still a newbie.  I am 8 mos smoke free.  I am amazed that I don't much think of smoking anymore.   It takes me getting really angry when I think about sabotaging myself and going back there.  I realize they are just self-destructive thoughts and childish!    I love being smoke free and am so grateful for all my new friends who helped me get to this point.

I'm still here! I'm still quit! Life is currently rough, but the quit is solid. I just passed 100 days and feel stronger every day. I'm dealing with the sudden, unexpected passing of a loved one and the diagnosis of a very serious autoimmune disease--all without lighting up.     I am proof that you can weather any storm WITHOUT smoking. There is absolutely NO good reason to light up.
    Sorry to hear life has deal you some tough cards right now Abby but you're attitude is bang on. You can do and handle anything better WITHOUT smoking.  Heek up the great work! 
    Aww sorry your going through a tough time Abby....  It's good to hear your quit is good ,and you understand smoking would not change what was happening...  We believed the lie smoking helped us cope with curve balls in our lives ..in fact ..we cope much better without dealing with nicotine withdrawal too.. Sending Hugs xx
    I'm sorry about your loved one abby and your diagnosis but am so proud of you for being able to keep your quit.  xoxo
    Ankush, Linda, and Dizzy the three of you are doing great -- I enjoy seeing your progress.  Abby keep strong -- you have the will and the strength good job!!!!
    I'm glad to see you all doing great in your quits.  Thanks for the updates.         Stay strong Abby.  That is really rough what you are going through but you know a cigarette will not make anything better.

    I thought that I breezed through menopause about ten years ago.  I did have the mood swings but the hot flashes were nothing.  Just a few at night.     Well.......is it possible that the smoking helped to stave off the hot flashes.  I have been having hot flashes for the past week.  During the day and at night.  That part of my life should be over by now.   Did any other ladies notice this?  I don't know whether it is something that I should be concerned about.This sucks,  if I get to redo this part of my life!!!!
Hi Sweetie ...  I had a early menopause .age 40....I'm still getting symptoms....so I don't know whether quitting would make a difference ...   Any concerns best asking the doctor...we  are all different .......to me it just gets worse ....sorry I'm no help ....
    Linda mine was a breeze too with maybe just a few hot flashes. So far I have not had that happen to me but so early in my quit it may happen somewhere down the line. Hope it's nothing and goes away soon. Love your quit by the way. You inspire me
    Oh !!! You two were lucky ...a walk in the park to me..jealous here !!!
I too went through early menopause right after I got my tubes tied at 39 or 40. I do though on occasion get hot flashes at night but not sure that it has anything to do with quitting or menopause. Just a body regulating itself?

If you Google it Linda there are a number of reasons that may be causing them so never a bad idea to get a check up and a blood test Edited March 19 by jillar
    Sweetie ... Sorry to hear that Linda...yes please go and get checked ....just to ease your mind ...xxx
    Smoking most definitely affects hormone balance. It takes time for your endocrine system to recover after you quit. There is a lot of information out there on the web about it. (I did a quick google search upon reading your question!) If you are concerned, of course talk to your doctor. But I suspect what you are going through is quite normal.       P.S. Hot flashes suck!
1 hour ago, abbynormal said:                P.S. Hot flashes suck!          You got that right.  Well we won't let the newbies know that could be a side affect of quitting.  Thanks for googling it.
Linda...get a blood test done, ask for things like full thyroid function. I can't comment on menopause cos  still waiting....but seeing as we are talking plumbing and some of our newbies might still have monthlies...when I quit mine went screwy...it was all over the place, cycle wise, took about 8months to settle back to normal... And my hot flushes were my thyroid.. which the nicotine had been masking, probably for years.      My cycles was so all over the place and the mood swings and hot flushes I was sure it was menopause...but my GP suspected not hence the blood test....there are a few endocrine conditions that are masked by nicotine... Things with me were odd from the get go but when I stopped the nrt they went really wacky.Edited March 19 by notsmokinjo
@notsmokinjo  I didn't know thyroid could affect hot flashes.  I fell, while walking the dogs last year, and broke my nose and knocked myself out.  One of life's embarrassing moments!     When I came to, the police and ambulance were there.  They made me go to the emergency room.  When they scanned my head, they found that I did break my nose but also had nodes on my thyroid.  I did get them biopsied and they were okay but they did advise me to get them checked every six months.   I think I will check on that too. Thanks for the info.
Most women in western societies have one or 2 thyroid nodes and never even know and they are completely benign and don't cause any issues. But if you do have them it's worth keeping an eye on them.
Here are some linksCigarettes Sabotage Hormone BalanceDoes quitting smoking decrease the risk of midlife hot flashes? A longitudinal analysis           I was pretty much over hot flashes when I quit but, they never seem to go away, depending on my stress levels,  I am still having hot flashes at sixty something.       Likely culprit is thyroid nonsense like  @notsmokinjo mentions.     I will also get hot flashes if I drink too much or feel frisky 'down there'.     Edited March 20 by Sazerac
Hi LT- I'm in agreement that you should get some bloodwork done. The thyroid is the the Queen gland & very well could be the cause.  Still -as mentioned it could be hormones you thought were done playing the game.  Could even be psychological and/or cardiac- are you stressed out, overly worried or anxious?  Please report your symptoms to your doc.       Menopause is banging on my door.

I was one of the lucky ones....went thru menopause at 51...had 6-8 months of the hot flashes (which were intense....esp when they would happen during meetings at work!! I always carried one of those collapsible folding fans with me...if I didn't, then the sweat would just drip down my face!!!) I have 2 sisters...both younger than me who went thru it a younger age than me....and they both still have the hot flashes and one still gets the night sweats! Going on 10-15 years now for them with the hot flashes/night sweats...one is now vaping the last 4 years and the other still smoking. I have been quit for over 2 years and haven't had any issues with flashes/night sweats.....
Thought I'd check in to say hello and that for all you newbies, it does get easier - the first week is awful, the first few months are too!  After about 8 or 9 months, I got a liberating feeling and now I no longer have cravings and rarely think about it.  I do occasionally have dreams where I am smoking and then wake up and think - phew!        On 18 April at 11.20am, I will be 2 years quit!     Keep at it you lot!

    Congratulations on your upcoming second anniversary Claire! Thanks for stopping by. I enjoy your updates.
Hi - I have just checked my Smoke Free app on my phone (which I would highly recommend!) and it says the following:     Time smoke free:  1 year, 11 months and 21 days Money saved:  £11,891 or £6022 per year Cigarettes not smoked:  21,620 - it's this figure that freaks me out!   Life regained:  180 days    Time spent not smoking:  75 days        You can all do this!    Claire
    Congratulations on nearly two years quit Claire, and thanks for the update and positive words for our newbies 
Your time spent not smoking is very interesting. It really adds up doesn't it?  Congrats on 2 years smoke free          It really is amazing how all that slavery to nicotine then all the angst from quitting just melts away with time leaving us exactly where we want to be - non smokers for life
Great to see you Claire ... Congratulations on your fabulous 2 year quit ...inspirational....
    Great job Claire.       Freedom ages like wine.  Savor the flavor.
    When I see how many people haven't smoked it really shocks me.      Congratulations on a great quit. 
    Congratulations Claire!   I'm glad you are doing so well in your quit.
    Congratulations on your continued freedom, Claire!  Stay vigilant and enjoy!        Jim
Posted 07 April 2009 - 11:31 PM Dear ___________,   I am about to try and change my life for the better. I have quit smoking. I just wanted to write this letter to you so you know what to expect for the next couple of weeks, since the process of withdrawal can be very challenging for me, and for those around me. (Most people do not realize it, but nicotine addiction is literally one of the hardest drugs to kick, even harder than heroin).   Everyone reacts to the withdrawal symptoms differently, but in general, during the first two weeks (Hell Week and Heck Week), I will most likely not be my normal self. My attention will literally be taken up with fighting the physical and mental urges to smoke. I may cry, I may yell, I may ignore you. Worst of all, I may say hurtful things to you, but I want you to know that this is the nicotine talking, not my heart. I WILL apologize afterwards, once the nicotine has left my body and my mind has cleared, but for the moment, please, PLEASE remember that I care about you, and let it roll off your back.    You need to know that when a smoker quits, the body and the mind will try almost anything to trick the user into taking another puff. I may rationalize that "now is not a good time" I may talk about feeling a sense of emptiness and loss. My body may develop aches and pains. I may not be able to sleep. I may act like the pain I am experiencing.   But be aware that I am doing this for ME, not for you. In this one important way, I have to be selfish, so that I cannot give the nicotine a reason to put the blame on anyone else.    Here are 10 things you CAN do to help:  • Be there when I need a hug, but don't be hurt when I push you away.   • If I tell you to leave me alone, give me space, but don't go too far...I need to know you are near no matter what the nicotine says.  • Don't try to argue with me when I start to rationalize...silence is a more powerful message.  • Avoid the topic of cigarettes (because I'm trying to get them off my mind), unless I bring it up first.   • Do the best you can to act as if everything is normal. The more "normal" you act, the faster I will get there.    • Consciously try to avoid letting me get into stressful situations...if something stressful can be put off for a couple of weeks, please try to do so. If not, please try to cushion me.   • Just keep telling me it will get better and that this effort is worth it.     • Tell me I am strong. Tell me you are proud of me. But also, tell me you will be there no matter what I say or do. I just wanted to prepare you because the first two weeks are usually the worst, but be aware that it doesn't suddenly get better...it will be a gradual process. Also, please be aware that while I am doing this quit for me, you and those around me will benefit as well. I will be free from the shackles of needing to know where the closest cigarette store is. I will be free of the smell. I will be free of an early death. And I will be free to spend more quality time with those I love.  Thank you in advance for being strong enough to care about me, and help me through this.    Love,   Me
    I always liked this one. It lays out pretty much exactly what to expect in the early days and loved ones close to you can either be a huge support to you or can make things even more difficult depending on how they react to your quit. Remember .... it's you quitting and going through all these difficult emotions and stressors not them so the better prepared they are the more they are likely to be able to help you out.
    I too liked this one and had even used a variation of this to my son and his family and it did help prepare them for that first month, it also let them know that this quit was for me -- no excuses, no one to blame but me, however their support would be helpful.  
    ^^^ And guess what ..... You Did IT!!
if you need a reason to quit heres one for you my brother in north Dakota needs  lung transplant   surgery do to emphysema from smokeing  . he has to be on 8 liters of oxagyn a minute just to breath. sitting he fine moving is a real hard for him because it takes all his engry just to go across the room. he singed up to be on a transplant listbut has to wait to see if the accept him or not if not he wont be here very long . he was calling all of us to let us know hes dieing so quit now don't wait . pray for him his name is eric .       love  not smiling today jimmy
    Prayers for your brother Jimmy. I hope he gets the help he needs.   None of us realize just what we are exposing ourselves to when we start smoking and even while we continue to indulge in that horrible addiction. Unfortunately we all live in self denial while we continue to expose ourselves to so much potential health implications.
I'm really sorry about your brother Jimmy, i'll keep positive thoughts that he will be accepted for a lung transplant...Edited April 9 by jillar
    Sorry to hear this Jimmy, my prayers will be with you and your brother !!!
    Sorry about your brother Jimmy.     Thanks for giving another reminder of the real cost of smoking.     Best wishes to you and your family.
    Awww this is so sad.        Sending my prayers to Eric and for all of you.      Take good care Jimmy 
    I'm really sorry to hear about Eric, Jimmy.  He is in my prayers.       Smoking really is horrible.
    Prayers for Eric and all his loved ones.  (((Jimmy)))
    Sending prayers to Eric and all the family ...I hate smoking with a passion ... I never thought I would say that in my life time ...prayers he gets the help he needs .xx
    So sorry Jimmy.  I am definitely sending prayers your way.      Reading this, I am so grateful that I was able to find the help here that I needed to quit.  
    So sorry Jimmy that is such sad news.  Smoking never does anything positive.    My thoughts are with you and your family.
    Prayers out to Eric and your family, Jimmy. Smoking is such a horrible addiction. Many addictions today overcome the life and the being quickly. Many times nicotine takes years to damage the body so we think it will never happen to us,  until it does.     Keep us posted. I feel confident that your brother will get what he needs. Hopefully he never smokes again.
    If found please return ASAP. Greatly missed by owner and family.    Free to any home : Brain Fog and General Grumpiness     So how long did it take for you to feel “normal” again? I know it’s not a quick fix and varies but would be interesting to know. TIA
    Hello dizzyd, by your post I think you've still got your sense of humor, at least some of it  Everything you're experiencing is normal at your stage of quit but the good news is that it's all temporary.  As far as the brain fog, I found eating sweets helped with that. For me it lasted almost a month I'd say. My grumpiness lasted a bit longer and I think it was honestly around the six month mark that I started feeling better.    It's important to remember that we are all so different in our quits so time lines for me won't necessarily be the same for you. I also quit more because I had to and not because I wanted to so that makes a huge difference in how your quit goes too.   I think you're doing awesome, congratulations on being done with hell week. That's the hardest week of all! 
    Hi DizzyD,      When I quit cold turkey several years ago, I thought the first month was pretty difficult.  After that, things started to slowly get better.  After one month, I still had temper tantrums and mental meltdowns once in a while, but the general everyday grumpiness was gone.  It took me a while to learn how to deal with my emotions as a non-smoker.  Things could improve quicker for you, we're all unique.  Hang in there!      Regarding brain fog, I didn't have that problem.  I actually felt like the fog lifted when I quit.      Mona
DizzyD,     Congrats on getting through Hell Week! I found the 1st day, 1st week and 1st month to be the most torturous! As the days add up all the craziness starts to fade away....where's your ticker?
With me the brain fog lasted I would say a couple of weeks and was still there a little for a week or so after that. I have heard people say it could be that your blood-sugar level is lower than when you smoked and that drinking fruit juice can help boost your leves. Not sure if that actually works or not. General crankiness and having a short fuse was probably the longest lasting symptom for me. That lasted off and on for a good 6 months I would say. Now, that wasn't constant or all the time but it did show itself from time to time. I think that was just me being impatient with the whole adjusting to being a non-smoker process. That symptom can vary hugely based on what your personality is to begin with I think. Many say "embrace the suck"and "focus on the positives" which is very true in reality but not everyone is able to do that. It does help though to step back from time to time, take a few deep breaths and think about the big picture - your end goal of having a healthier life and one free from being a slave to your addiction. Those are pretty big prizes so it''s no wonder there's some ugliness involved.      Keep going and congrats one your 1st week! There's the worst one done and in the bin!
I had pretty bad brain fog for a few months and a general sense of irritability and grumpiness for long after that.     I'd say around the 9 month mark was when I realized I felt "normal".     2 years later, it's all just a blur -like it never happened. Stick with it and know that it will get better and will all be worth it.
Oh yes, quitting is a process and it takes time to go through that process.  It takes a few weeks to get rid of that "foggy feeling" (though as said above it varies from person to person).  After about 2-3 weeks you will begin to notice some positives, small and large, from quitting -- focus on those victories, they will carry you through until you feel close to "normal" and that will just sneak up on you and slap you in the face like it did me last fall.  In short work through the process and celebrate each victory and each day and you will benefit greatly and see that it can be done!!!!
Ride with it.... Watch a funny movie, listen to chill out music, eat popcorn or whatever lol, anything to make you feel better. Plenty of treats, dont worry about the weight gain, just focus on you. I had brain fog and severe lethargy first few weeks, my electric blanket and a good movie comforted me. Id say about month 4 i started to feel a bit better, then much better and confidence  improved around month 8. Time seems to stand still the first few weeks, but honestly, it then seems to accelerate... and that normal feeling returns.  Hang in there....
I hardly think about it anymore, even when leaving airports after a flight - I would spark up as soon as I got outside!     For me the process was:     Week 1 - hell on earth! Month 1 - as above! After 2 months, I was still getting triggers when I got in the car, off a train etc 6 months - the triggers were fewer  9 months - as above 1 year - so chuffed and felt liberated  Now at nearly 2 years  - I would never ever want to smoke again and the thought of it makes me feel rubbish     I was on 30 a day, so if I could do it, you all can!
Oh a March quitter like I was and uk based!!  Look at you go and heading for your month, not long now    Mind you I was March cause I screwed up the new year quit lol. I digress though.       The fog is a real thing huh. I seem to recall feeling better, getting the odd bitch slap but better after 6 weeks. Much clearer after month 3 and although that sounds like a world away it really isn't if you just put one foot in front of the other for a while and start to educate yourself on the reality of what smoking does to us.  Although everyone is different I seem to remember folks on my level reporting about the same. Try having a run though, even if you don't run...it's fab how much further you can get already (I got about 500 yards but prior to that I would have had to massively cough and regroup now run 3k comfortably without any training).       You may feel cranky and grumpy, but what you are giving yourself is a real gift. Not just the quitting but the self respect and the ability to trust yourself to dig deep in future - the unexpected gains from quitting. Keep going. xx
        Vape Nation: Vaping Is Bad, Kids    The Surgeon General declared youth e-cigarette use to be an epidemic, but many vaping   communities online downplay the risks. What does the evidence show?https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/vape-nation-vaping-is-bad-kids/         EZPZ
    No doubt that Vaping is bad and the science is there to prove that fact.  What is also disturbing is the marketing behind it.  Cigarettes long ago were no longer allowed to be advertised, however that is not true for vaping since there are televised commercials.  This also should be addressed because it only reinforces the idea that vaping is a safe alternative (which is not true).  I am afraid so many others will be lost to nicotine at this point!!!
    I noticed that a huge vape shop/lounge near me is gone.  It is now a tattoo and piercing studio.   Is the fad starting to fade?
    I think vaping is nonsense. I tried it for a very short while and then gave it up. Its no good. Just makes the insides of the ears so itchy. Besides, if one thinks about it, NRT as a whole is pointless. One is just substituting one Nicotine source for another. Nicotine is the addictive drug. Whats's the point of substituting one addictive source (cigarettes) for another (NRT)? It does not help beat the addiction for good, just changes the source while keeping the person still addicted. 
@Ankush while I agree that vaping is nonsense I do not agree with your stance on other NRT's. We've got lots of successful quitters who have quit using NRT. Yes, they had nicotine in their systems longer but they used them as recommended and quit smoking.  That's the goal right?!  
    As long as you stick to the programme ...NRT can be a useful tool ...we have had alot of successful quitters ..who quit using NRT....

I was just speaking from experience. I had tried Nicotine gum for a few days. It just made me want to smoke more. There are other forms of NRT as well, (medications such as Chantix and Zyben) but that will just shift the dependency from one source to another. Maybe such medication is helpful for people who take psychiatric medication, however, all medication comes with its own side effects which may not be disclosed by the doctor or insufficient information is available on the internet about such drugs. Again, its just about shifting dependency from one source to another source.
    You sound ready to jump on @Ankush.....go on ...I dare you !!!!...

Btw, is there a thread on Quittrain for people who do take psychiatric medication and are trying to quit smoking? I searched a lot, but I could not find such a thread.

Umm, I don't know.     @Jet Black Vaping cannot be harmless water vapor. It contains Nicotine and a chemical called Propylene Gloycol and the latter's effects on the human anatomy have not yet been fully understood. I find it hard to believe that a person can literally get addicted to cold turkey meat. In any case, the lesson for us all is never to start smoking in the first place.

If all they had given up was nicotine their fix should be enough.       Yes I want to be nicotine free but that's the least of my problems. Too much focus is put on the nicotine and not enough on the habit.

Nicotine is an addiction, but the act of smoking can be an addiction too (since that is the way Nicotine is administered into our bodies)? We all have been so used to smoking cigarettes, that the very act of not smoking cigarettes can be a brain drain at the beginning of a quit. As per my experience, when I did try NRT, it literally left a weird taste in my mouth that made me want to smoke more (with the gum), and made my ears itchy and just didn't give me the satisfaction of smoking a real cigarette (with the e-cig). That's why I gave up on NRT. I realized its just a waste of time and money for two reasons - first, it costs much more than regular cigarettes (where I come from), second it just makes me want to go back to smoking regular cigarettes and also because I realized its just a different way of administering Nicotine in the body. If its the act of smoking that bothers you, then may be you could do what Jillar did - use a straw and call it Jillar's air cigarette. I never tried it (didn't need to), but may be it will work for you.
    You have a great attitude A...keep yourself grounded and youv,e got this ...I just had a punching pillow ..worked for me .!!!    
    NRT worked for me purely because my issue was more about the habit and psychological addiction than it was the physical...once I broke the back of the habit, of the psychological compulsion is stoped the gum. The nicotine side of it was much easier for me. Do I feel that NRT prolonged the angsty, early stages of my quit?...yep, if for some stupid reason I had the time over would I use the NRT again?...yep, why??? Because it worked for me... it's doesn't work for everyone, many don't need it.. but I did.    SOS helps just as many as it doesn't. If you don't bother to post an SOS you'll never know if it works for you.

My husband used to ask why I didn't try vaping instead of smoking cigarettes. (He can't stand the smell of cigarettes.) I told him that no other form of nicotine had the same effect. I tried vaping. I didn't see the appeal.        Cigarette smoking is a complex addiction. Of course there is the addictive substance, nicotine, to deal with. But then there is the act of smoking--by that I mean the physical act--that is appealing to smokers. There is the habit of smoking--all of the places, events, etc. that trigger the desire for a smoke. And there are the cigarettes themselves--the taste, the brand, the buzz.     It's all evil, I tell you!

Sorry for your loss @Doreensfree.       No vape adds down under. It is illegal to sell them with nicotine down here. In some states you can import nicotine liquid but only enough for a 2 month individual supply.

As you know I recently had pneumonia and I googled it looking for ways to speed up my recovery. I read an article that said e-cig vapour adds moisture to your lungs and can exacerbate pneumonia.      As you say we aren't medical professionals but I can't help but agree that there is a strong possibility that there's a link.       Hope you are ok and sending you strength and a big hug

        If you havn,t read this book yet...its a must...    He has helped millions....  You can download it on the internet ,and read it for free...    What have you got to lose.!!!!....nothing.... And could gain freedom !!!
    Brill book. I did not read it in my forever quit (this quit) but i still retain some of the info read in it all those years ago. All good. Get reading folks. 
    This book definitely changed my view of smoking.  Definitely worthwhile reading for anyone quitting or thinking about quitting.
    Thanks Doreen. I found the book in pdf format online and haven't been able to put it down. I agree with johnny. It has changed my view of smoking and quitting smoking. 
    This book pulled the blinders off & I could finally see the true nastiness that is addiction to nicotine.  
    Bump...for anyone who has not read this amazing book ...
    One of the most important books I ever read.        Exposed the myths surrounding smoking and made the lies we told ourselves as smokers impossible to defend anymore.
Not a fan of the book (to say the least); I share that not at all to troll on the original post or supporters of Carr, but instead to speak to those who might read it and feel like maybe they're missing something or that there's something wrong with their quit.  It's not for everyone, and as long as you're not smoking you're doing great.  Lots of people have benefitted from the book, and I certainly respect its impact.              Christian99 17+ Years Quit Edited April 5 by Christian99
    I read it years ago and quit but failed quickly in that quit.   But still to this day retain some of the logic from the book. It is invaluable. I say read the book for sure. It will only help you.    It wasn't a magic book for me but it did teach me a hell of a lot which is what quitting for good is all about. 
    I read it recently as someone gave me a copy as a gift.  Just like the forum take what you need and leave the rest. 
I think there is a lot of good information in the book but here is the problem that I have with it.  In Chapter 1, he talks about his wife sending him to a hypnotherapist for his smoking.  After the session,  he lost his desire to smoke.  To quote, "not only did I stop smoking, but I actually enjoyed the process even during the withdrawal period."  So, it seems to me that he did not use his own "Easy Way" (which is not easy by the way...ha ha) to quit smoking.  Hypnosis is what worked for him.  I did somewhat benefit from reading the book but it is not the end all be all for me.

Allen Carr finally stopped smoking on 15 July 1983, aged 48, after a visit to a hypnotherapist. However, it wasn't the hypnotherapy itself that enabled him to stop – "I succeeded in spite of and not because of that visit" and "I lit up the moment I left the clinic and made my way home...".

I now know that nicotine and tobacco produce something of a "high". Maybe like a watered-down "stoned" effect one gets from smoking weed.   For me, I was on that tobacco "high" for 15 years. I never really noticed just how bad many drivers were.   Anyways, since quitting 1.5 years ago, I notice a lot of drivers suuuuuck. Everything from aggression, not paying attention, tailgating on the highway, not using headlights when it is dark out, whatever. Today though, there was a wreck on the highway. This was hours ago yet I am still annoyed. Because of ONE careless needle-prick driver, 100's of peoples' day was thrown off. I was late for work.      You know, I ain't gonna lie. If I were a "Stress smoker", today would have done me in. I feel like jack slapping someone but not too much like smoking. I even told my room mate that if stress were  trigger then I would have picked it back up this day. But no, my trigger to want to light up is excitement. Like if Micheal Bolton released a new album. OK kidding, don't no one listen to that.     So anyways, however long you have been quit for, did you notice drivers started to suck worse at that point?
    I noticed that drivers got worse once cell phone became popular.  Too many people yapping on the phone and not paying attention.  Didn't notice anything different when I quit smoking.

    I don't think anyones driving got worst but my temper did. Stupid things would turn me all Rambo like someone not indicating at a roundabout.       Sounds like you've just become more angrier too 
    My life became less stressful when I vowed to not take anything that happens in traffic personally and quit reacting to all the idiocy I see on the roadways every day.     My reaction to stupid drivers now is pretty much limited to me grumbling something along the lines of: "what the....you f***ing idiot."  Then a deep breath and move on.        I used to do the whole "road rage" thing.  It's pointless, dangerous, and a real waste of energy.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
so get this - I have worked at the same place over seven years. Seldom ever saw anything stupid. But...     Friday someone was in a wreck. Monday there was one, Tuesday there was one and I was 20 minutes late, and today I left early just to account for any BS I might encounter. Surr as a crap diaper stinks, there was a wreck close to my job. In do not work weekends but anyways, so I am wondering how many days in a row, HOPING no one hits MY heap of blue crap.     You know, back in Dec 2015, someone side swiped my car because I was in the turning lane and he was at a red light, he was trying to get to the gas station. Just pulled out right in front of me. Yeah I got a nice insurance check (more than the car was worth)  Pop quiz - GUESS, just GUESS what he was going in to buy while we waited for the police? KTQ kids.
It's just the way things are today.     I took a long hiatus from riding motorcycles and now that I'm regularly riding again -and I'm hyper-aware of everything- I notice damn near everyone is talking/texting nowadays.       They good news is that you can spot these idiots a mile away, so they're pretty easy to avoid. I don't really like to wish harm on anyone, but I often find myself wishing these selfish douchebags end up in a ditch.Edited April 4 by JimHannoonen

I have just put out my last cigarette. I forced myself to have it just so I could say I had my last cigarette at 7.20pm. I physically couldn't inhale but I needed to go through the whole last cigarette ritual.       I'm on day 5 of pneumonia and I can't hear much above the sound of my chest. I can't walk to the toilet without help, I haven't washed my hair or had a shower in all that time. I take more steroids, inhalers and antibiotics than I can count and still I can't breathe. This is the most frightened I have ever felt but I am one of the lucky ones. I know I will be up and about in time but if I carry on smoking this could be my life.         I sleep as much as I can and have almost zero energy so I won't be able to take part too much but will read x
    Addiction is a horrible thing, Lilly, but it is conquerable.    I hope you are able to quit smoking.     
    Oh Lily, I hope you can quit this time.  It is amazing how much healthier you feel after quitting.  Take care and we will be here to help you through.
    Aw Lilly that sounds fecking horrible. You need to chuck the fags big time!!!       Have you got a plan or just going for it? 
    Just going for it. It's really easy when you physically can't smoke. The choice has been taken away so no internal debates, no thoughts - just nothing.     Hope you're ok and life is good x
    Sorry you're not feeling good Lilly. Congrats on throwing the cigs away. You can do it this time. Stay close and post an SOS if you feel yourself caving to a crave
    Welcome back Lilly, even if it's under awful circumstances. You can do this.

    Could be Allen Carr logic, I remember smoking the 'last cigarette' at one point during that book. You are told to.      Im sure plenty of us have smoked a 'last cigarette'. And thought through it, this is it, this is the last fag.

I really believe awareness about ones own junky mind comes afterwards and needs to be cultivated. Thats where a solid quit is build..        -edit- I think what I mean is, putting it out is, as crazy as it sounds, just a part of quitting. Its really nothing more than... putting it out. The ritual thing gives the cigaret way more credit than it deserves.      I whish you determination this time, Lilly. You say you didnt have a choice, health wise. There's always choice, whether its about smoking a last one OR smoking a first-of-many-one.        Edited March 1 by MLMR
    I remember being that sick....no way could I have smoked ....but as soon as I was on the mend ...I made up for lost time ..smoking more ....    I wish my junkie brain had said to me .....Dont be a jerk ...    
We'll need to tell Mr Carr to edit that part out his book that has helped 30 million people quit smoking.       Every single person here smoked a last fag before quitting. We all did it. Healthy or not healthy.      No one quitting should be scoffed at and certainly not because of their health status.
No one is scoffing at anybody.

    Jeez. When someone is still smoking they are clearly still addicted, still an addict. Someone smoking their last fag is still in the midst of addiction. Red flags, eat your heart out. Never have guessed we re at a stop smoking forum? Addiction is a bitch and something some of us have overcome, some are still trying. But a sick person smoking their last fag and trying to quit.... If I had lung cancer and wanted to quit would you be equally as cold to me? Smoking a last fag is the norm!!!! No red flags. Read the book. Book or not we all did it. Folk here have had family members die as smokers from smoking related illnesses. Everyone deserves encouragement not a pissy attitude 
    Hope you are back to good health soon, Lilly.
I had my last smoke at 11:48pm on 27th of November 2017....we all had a last smoke. Don't get caught in the semantics.      A big part of smoking is the ritual, only makes sense that for some a big part of quitting will be ritual as well...

    Get well soon Lily...   We have given Mona a idea ,to team up with you ...the both of you seem to struggle to keep a sticky quit ...    Work as a team ..spur each other on....what have you got to lose ...it just might get you both your sticky quit...if not .....then you havnt lost anything you had before.. Consider it ...plus you two should stay closer and post more often ,this also will spur you both on ... Try something different ....who knows ...what magic will happen ...  
    Thanks everyone for your posts.         A couple of people came to sit with me through the week. One brought soup and the other brought me the Allen Carr book.         I had the cigarette for two reasons. One because it was what he said to do, and two because if I hadn't then as soon as I was better that would be my reason for relapsing. I knew I would tell myself I hadn't had that last cigarette so I'm going to do it now etc.      I am definitely going down the NRT route so I'm trying out lots of different stuff tomorrow night. 
    I hope whatever you choose works for you, Lily.  Have you ever had a long-term quit?  If not, trust me when I say that it's great!

I had my last poison stick right after the doctor at  urgent care told me I had a stroke. Imagine this, crazy as it sounds -  my friend was bringing me to the emergency room and I told him I was not getting into his truck until I smoked one last poison stick....cuz I knew it would be the last one I would ever have!!!!

    Hey Lilly,  How is your quit going ?    How many days ? How are you feeling ?   How are you dealing with triggers and craves ?  Are you using any NRTs ?
Gosh that's like a cross examination        I'm still quit but definitely not confident. I've been in bed since I quit and only got up today. Haven't had to deal with triggers/craves yet.         Not using NRT yet but do have a pack of lozenges on standby.Edited March 9 by Lilly
@Lilly it's probably a blessing you've been in bed all this time. I slept for about 3 days after I quit. Sleep can help you get through the worst of it. I hope you are feeling a bit better. I'm sorry you've been so sick!        You will grow more confident in your quit as time passes.

    Lilly - it's the same for all of us no matter what path we take to quit smoking. NRT Champix or cold turkey; doesn't matter, It's all the same in the end. You have to be prepared to endure a short period of discomfort in order to feel normal again without smoking. It's just the way it is for everyone. Until you are prepared to go through that adjustment you will struggle and repeat the same scenario you have done for over a year now . You need to just quit smoking!! It won't kill you but continuing to smoke might just do that         Based on what you have said over this past year I am very concerned that you may have already done damage to your lungs. Have you seen a pulmonologist for an assessment of your lung function in the past year? (A PFT assessment and CT Scan of your lungs) If not; please do this. You need to stop smoking right now and get your lungs checked. This is serious business. Just do it no matter what the temporary upset to you might be. You can't afford to go on like this! I'm sorry if this upsets you but you need to address your addiction to nicotine immediately!         We all thought we could not live without cigarettes at one time but we have all just said ..... NO; no more!! And, we have all endured what ever discomfort we had to in order to come out the other side as non smokers. YOU CAN DO IT TOO!! You need to believe this and just do it. Like I said, quitting won;t kill you.
    Stop giving the smokes so much power Lilly... you are the one with with power, only you... you need to be the one to not put something in your mouth and burn it. The battle isn't with anything but yourself Lilly.... you have to let yourself win... first step is believing you can do it.
    Lilly...you are no more addicted to what any of us where....    We just made the decision to never smoke again ....Ever ....no matter what was happening ...    You just have to want it bad enough ....you carnt enter a quit half-hearted ...it has to be the whole of you ....
    Lilly, it is plain and simple that you are an addict.  You become obsessed with that cigarette you are not going to have the minute you quit.  That is what an addict does. You need to concentrate on how wonderful a life is without them.    I was scared to death to quit but the minute I realized I could, the thought of going back repulsed me.  Once you gain the power to quit,  you need to hold onto it.  Respect it, admire it and hold onto it with all you have.   Distraction is the most important.  You were a wonderful blogger.  You really put meaning in your feelings.  You are worth so much more than that cigarette.  I believed in you from the beginning.  Now, you need to believe in yourself.    This illness has gotten you through the withdrawal period.  Take that and go with it. You have the power to do this!
    You've been given great advice Lilly, use us to help you past those first hard days/weeks/months. Post an SOS if you think you're going to cave to a crave and let us help you through it. No one here is a special snowflake, we all had to endure the misery and we all made it through to the other side. You can too...……...
    Keep posting about what you are feeling.    When you see your words you can't help but  have awareness of your Self Sabotage.       You can break this silly and dangerous pattern. It is all about choice. You have power to put nicotine away just like all of us did.    It is not rocket science.  It is a simple choice.  NOPE.        The addict's voice is LOUD. You needn't listen and obey anymore.    Go forward on the journey.       
                                            Cigarettes always win in my life.                                                   This right here is why you keep going back. You are giving the cigarettes too much power. As others have already said, the power is within YOU. The cigarette can't jump into your mouth and light itself.      The choice is YOURS.        We are all addicts here. None of us had it easy. We all struggled with addiction and the desire to quit. (Otherwise we wouldn't be here.) And we all made a choice to stop putting those sticks in our mouths and lighting them on fire. That's it. There's no big secret to it. You make the CHOICE every day...every hour...every minute...NOT to smoke.      I believe you when you say you want to be a non-smoker. I'm here to tell you that you CAN make it happen!       I'm here to offer support anytime. Don't hesitate to reach out.     Love, Abby
Thank you everyone for your replies.        I did hit the self destruct button like I always do and after being up for an hour I smoked. I didn't SOS because I knew nobody was going to stop me and I didn't want to go through the motions and waste everyone's time.         Do you know what breaks my heart right now?  It's not smoking, it's not that I'm a complete failure - it's you people. I'm throwing away quit after quit and you all care more about me than I do about myself. I'll be honest and say I thought Jo, Doreen and Reci had completely washed their hands of me and my quits. When I saw all your names I couldn't help but cry.       Reci I have already received some news about my lungs.  Nothing is confirmed at this stage it is just what my Doctor thinks could be wrong.  They want to wait six weeks before they do the tests so my chest is recovered from this illness.       So this morning after reading all your messages I went to see a Quit Smoking Counsellor. She wants me to use patches for the full 12 week course as she thinks this will appeal to my OCD. Following programmes is something I usually flourish with and I like to see them through.        So I will be back when I start this on Wednesday which is No Smoking Day in the UK. Again picking a special day also appeals to my OCD      Thank you again. You have no idea how much you all make a difference to other peoples lives x
    I sincerely hope the direct one on one counselling helps keep you focused and on track Lilly. Another thing that quitting will do for you is show you just how strong you can be. The feeling of pride in accomplishing this amaze you. We're always standing by here to support you and anyone else making a serious attempt at quitting this ugly addiction.
I'm sorry that you had to go to a quit smoking Councillor but I am happy that you did. You now have a plan and I used my OCD and competitive streak to get me through the first few months. So I was mainly competing against myself but it worked for me. You have to deal with the OCD anyway, why not embrace it and make it work for you. So create a routine for yourself... at x time each day you watch a video or read an article... only needs to be 5mins worth... but its a pattern and a commitment.... build your knowledge because knowledge is power. Weegie used a quit councellor and look how successful that was for her. So maybe even a daily mantra.... I don't want to smoke, I will not smoke.... and then as you pop off to bed at night.... "I don't want to smoke, and today I didn't".Edited March 11 by notsmokinjo
I am sorry but, not surprised to hear you relapsed, Lilly.You dropped red flags all over the place.That is one of the reasons why I asked you about your quit , earlier in this thread.  I thought if you were encouraged to stay current with yourself, you might avert another relapse.The responses from this community have been spectacular.  Please take them all to heart.    Addiction is a serious business and it takes being brutally honest with yourself, which turns out to be one of the best rewards.    I am sorry you are waiting until Wednesday. I bet those last few smokes are going to be scrumptious (not).Wednesday is not a magical day that ensures a successful quit, you know.If you don't commit to yourself and your quit you might as well forget it.    Will you educate yourself about your addiction ?I know you think you are educated 'enough'  but, it obviously isn't sinking in.     Education will help you separate from addiction.You can begin to understand your actions and feelings through the withdrawal process instead of acting out.     Education gives you Power.So does quitting.     Freedom from nicotine opens up a whole new world of self-respect and confidence and the ability to honestly Trust yourself.All of which will benevolently change you.Please give your quit and yourself a chance.               
I can see why you have picked Wednesday ....it's a statement ..NO SMOKING DAY...but ....    It sounds as if your lungs need help from today !!!!....so why wait ....?????   We have had quite a few people quit with help with patches ..you can do this ....   We can support you 100%....but Lilly you have to do the work ....

    Lilly,  Are you on NRTs ?   Have you being advised by a counselor ? What kind of counselor are they ?   Do you have a plan that you worked out ?        Answer if you will, I think it would be helpful for those newly quit or about to jump into a quit.  It will also be helpful to your supporters in guiding you the best way.     It is always very exciting starting a new adventure, use your exuberance to solidify your commitment to yourself.   Your smiles will be rewarded.                
    Congrats on getting back on your quit Lilly, let's do this!  We're all here to help so use us as needed when needed.....

We have places where you can just walk in, have a chat and you get free NRT for 8 weeks. They gave me patches but I haven't put one on yet. The plan is to use the strongest one for 8 weeks, step down for two weeks and then step down to the lowest one for another two weeks
I've used the free nhs stop smoking service twice. The first one was brilliant. A group of about 20 people met at a local hall weekly. And we actually smoked for the first three weeks and just learned about quitting and got a plan....got prepared. Then boom we all quit! That was a champix quit for me but it didn't last long. But that team spirit really felt great.  Second time they changed the format and it was just a weekly drop in service where you'd get like 15 minutes one to one with a counsellor. And you could mix with other quitters waiting. That was still good but felt less of a team. Low and behold they shut for two weeks over Christmas!! And that was me back on the fags!    I really liked having that weekly meet and having someone check up on me. They measure your co2 and it was rewarding seeing that going down and down.       This time round I used the pharmacy service which isn't as good. They are not stop smoking counsellors. But I got my weekly meet, free NRT and they measured my co2. So still a very good service.      This wee bit of extra support will help you im sure Lily! I used the patches for about 3 - 4 weeks. I really found them awesome and they basically took away the urge. So all I had was 'time for a fag'...'oh no it's not, I dont smoke' thoughts!         I was really firm on not entertaining these thoughts. Don't torture yourself. I always said to myself don't let a thought turn into a crave. Just squash it, bat it away! Move on!!
    Good for you Lilly.....you can do it ....   Don't struggle ...slap a patch on ...give yourself every chance this time ....
    Thanks, Lilly.  I am glad @WeegieWoman is around,   she is a patch success story.       You don't smoke anymore.    Congratulations.
    Way to  "Nope" Lily!  Step by step you are getting this. 
    Keep a list of all the reasons you want to quit close to you all the time Lilly. On your phone or written on paper so you can pull that out and read them any time you have a smoking thought. Focusing on all the positives your are gaining by quitting and knowing that the only reason you don't already have those things is because of smoking might just help you readjust your thinking more quickly. See the positives - not the negatives  
Thanks so much everyone.        Not having the best day. Not quit wise but patch wise. After about half an hour my arm was so painful. The only way I can describe it is it feels like someone has been repeatedly punching me in the arm. I spent the first hour convincing myself I was about to have a heart attack   I bought some lower strength ones and will try them tomorrow to see if that makes any difference.      I'm doing my positive thinking Reci  That tip was a great one thank you.        I'm back at work tomorrow as can't stand another day stuck at home. I won't be able to post as much but will log in straight away from my phone if I'm struggling.   @WeegieWoman you've given me hope with the patches. The clinic I went to did my co2 reading, gave a bit of advice then gave me the NRT.  It's in a hall so met lots of other people quitting while I was waiting. Did you get any side effects?        I love you lot so much
    No negative side effects but my pal got really itchy skin from them. But he put up with that as they helped so much with stopping smoking!!         Where did you put it? I'm sure a weaker strength will ease your symptoms a bit. And you could maybe try a different part of your body? I generally always put them top outside of my arms but I've heard of people putting them all over the place!         I'd give it another day for sure and see how you get on. If your still struggling may need to think of an alternative. I was given patches and lozenges at the start of my quit.        Going back to work will only help your quit I reckon. And that's good you're fit enough to go back to work 
I put it at the top of my arm on outside. More or less where you would get an injection. They also gave a second NRT so I have a back up. I like the idea of the patches - slap it on in the morning and forget about it so hoping the lower strength is better.        I got given the inhalator too but trying not to use those unless I get really desperate.        I'm looking forward to work. I feel well I'm just a bit wiped out. They said I could feel like that for a few weeks so can't wait for that to pass.         Really appreciate hearing about your experience with the patch xEdited March 13 by Lilly
If the Step #1 patches are a problem maybe try to go back to the place you got them and discuss with them? They may have some suggestions for you including advise about starting with a lower dose patch. Just a suggestion.

I was working it out just now and each cigarette has 0.5mg of nicotine. Even smoking 30 a day I would have only been taking in 15mg so maybe it is just a lot more than my body is used to
     I agree...always check...this dose maybe too strong for you Lilly...    
Congratulations LilIy!!The research I have found is that most cigarettes delivers about 1mg of nicotine. But I think it depends on how you smoke. I don’t think the 21 mg patch is too much for you.I used the patch. It’s a long story but my father had them mailed to me. I started with a 21 mg and if I remember correctly used it for about six or seven weeks. I Always had two patches on at once, with one of them being 48 hours old.I smoked nearly 2 packs of cigarettes a day.     Move the patch around. Don’t ever put it in the same place twice. Hell, put it on your ass if you have to. I found that the shoulder blade area worked best for me.     Make it work!           Cigarettes do nothing for us. They take away our time, our money and our health.         https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&channel=iphone_bm&source=hp&ei=ZnKJXPWKLueI_QbntaegDw&q=+how+much+nicotine+is+in+one+cigarette+&oq=+how+much+nicotine+is+in+one+cigarette+&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-hp.3..0l8.4501.8759..9237...0.0..0.94.618.10......0....1.......8..41j0i131j46i275.xk1MRNN6pf0Edited March 13 by Octain
    Thanks Octain. I will try the shoulder blade area tomorrow and see how that goes. I've decided not to sleep with it tonight. I've taken it off, had a bath and have come to bed.        I've got through a whole day so despite the pain they obviously help 
    One day is miraculous!  We did whatever we had to do to get that cigarette. We walked in the snow, the rain, and the heat to get a cigarette. Why wouldn’t we use that same energy to stay away from them?  Pfft.  If I can do it, anyone can.
Fantastic work on day 1. It does sound like that patch is a bit much but they really do aggravate you I think. Can still work though and if you like the idea then why not. I'd maybe step down a patch though if you think it's too much.  Keep talking too. It's the information and education that stops us relapsing. I'm sorry to say it but we have a junkies brain and we have to get past it, so dig in and we've got you. Failure is not an option and all that. If you can do anything except smoke, that's a mighty big list of things to do. Maybe create an actual "distract my brain" list. Things you can do to swerve the thoughts. They are only thoughts. You already said you don't want to smoke and I know that's the truth of it. We all do. The problem is short term the nicotine addiction but that passes so quickly, like 72 hours without nicotine in your body (although using patches prolongs that but creates a safety feeling elsewhere-each to their own). But your bigger issue is your own junkie mind...telling you, we would smoke here.....hello...hello...we would smoke here. It's mentally uncomfortable but not damaging to tell your brain, hey thanks for the reminder but we quit, we don't smoke now. This message eventually replaces the old message and voila!    I know I'm further down the road but I don't ever forget the journey it took to get me here and I want you toknow 100%, there is nothing that would make me want to smoke now or ever, nothing. It controlled me and I never signed up to that. You will feel the same, I promise. Just persevere.  Much love. x
I really needed to read these posts tonight so thank you for all your great advice.         So today I went back to work. Obviously everyone who passed me stopped to check how I was. I told each and every one of them I had quit smoking. So the first guy I told just laughed and said you haven't quit smoking if you're wearing a patch. I'll come and congralute you when that comes off. I was a bit shocked but never said anything.       Seriously EVERY time someone spoke to me he would pipe up with his oh she hasn't quit yet as she's wearing a patch.         I asked him after an hour why he kept saying I hadn't quit and he said because you've still got nicotine going in all day.      I was there for 9 hours and this went on all day. I got in the car to come home, drove up the road then burst into tears. I feel really deflated and like he sucked every bit of positivity out of me.      I get that people have an opinion on NRT but I don't get why he just kept going on and on and on.       I'm 20 minutes away from completing another day so have come to my safe haven to see the people who get it
    Lilly....this is your quit ...and yours alone ...   Who cares what he thinks ...just let it go over your head ....Just ignore it.....   Some people just carnt,t help themselves....    One day at a time ...
    Lilly, it sounds like this guy is a total douche, pardon the expression. Next time he says "I'll come congratulate you when the patch comes off," respond with, "And I'll congratulate you when your attitude doesn't suck!"        You are doing great. Don't let one major douchebag ruin your quit for you!
    Thanks both of you. I don't know why I let him get to me but he did.        Douche has made me laugh. If he pipes up again tomorrow I'll just think of that and smile to myself x
    Well, first of all, he is a jerk (excuse me).  Some people get joy out of making you feel smaller than you are.  He should have been encouraging you for your efforts.      Lilly don't let anyone bring you down.  Remember, you are running that marathon and doing this for yourself and not anyone else.  Stay focused on the forum.  We know what you are experiencing.  There is nothing wrong with using NRT to attain your goal.  Hang tough.  I know you will make it.  
    Lilly, like the others said, who cares what that guy says! You are smoking, that's HUGE! Keep using your patch, it's working! And don't let anyone tell you differently!!!
    Yes! Don't listen to him. He knows nothing about quitting is my guess. Some people just look at the negative side of everything. If he's a smoker, I'm betting he wants to quit too and is jealous that you are brave enough to do it before he does.. You are taking a positive step - not a negative one. Let him be the one to eat crow at the end of the day

    I stayed mum about my quit,     I don't converse about personal stuff with many anyway. Don't much care to hear what the great haute monde or the hoi polloi has to say about my trip.  lol.        Just focus on YOU never putting a cigarette in your mouth again.    You will deal with your nicotine addiction.     At the end of the day, it IS all about putting the nicotine addiction to sleep.  
Ahhh the inevitable "voice of doom" in the background who is a know it all jerk, we've all seen them! I had it, from people online and in person because I was on champix. I will repeat my learnings, it takes 72 hours, yes just 3 days for nicotine to clear your body. It is the mental discomfort that is the fight really, not the getting rid of what the patch is replacing. I wil say though, I found the patch harder than not after a short while, but I know a lot of people who have quit in multiple ways. The key is educating yourself on the hows and why's you got addicted and why that means you need to break free now....then not putting anything in your mouth and setting fire to it.      Ps, I'm not above a little laxative powder in their coffee or lunch if they need teaching a little lesson

You repeatedly promote nicotine gum, not as a tool to help you quit nicotine but, as a lifestyle.   This is sad and unhelpful to people honestly dealing with nicotine addiction.       There is no wrong way to quit smoking and quit nicotine.Edited March 18 by Sazerac
It works for me , that is why i use it .        Why is that sort of so hard for you to understand ?     This nicotine gum exactly is the reason why i have not damaged my lungs with smoke since the past 3 months , Lol        You talk like you know it all , Lol     How does one ignore a profile in this forum ?

    What facts ?        The fact that i use Nicotine gums so that i can stop inhaling smoke in my lungs ?
I Think the point that was trying to be made was .....Its easy to swop one addiction for another ....   The programme on gum should not last longer than 12 weeks ....same as any other NRT...
Patz, I do not understand why you are being confrontational.  That does not seem like you.  Believe it or not, people on this forum care about you.  You may have subdued your addition to smoking but you are still addicted to the nicotine.  Yes it is good not to have the smoke in your lungs but it is not good to have the nicotine in your body.  I just lost a friend to tongue cancer.    They were young like you and died very quickly. Most of us on the forum want you to be able to free yourself of your addiction and live a full, healthy life.        Edited March 18 by Linda Thomas
@Doreensfree , @Linda Thomas        Thanks for the reply        Sorry for the trouble .     Eating nicotine gums for me was the best way to stay away from the irritations of addiction .       Yes , Nicotine addiction is a strange irritation        Going cold turkey was not helping me much , I had to waste my time thinking about another 100 things to take my mind of the addiction that kept coming back .       But once i made Eating nicotine gums a habit , That strange irritation of addiction went away .     Nowadays i eat a pack of gums only every three or four days .       That is a big improvementEdited March 18 by Redemption3
    No one is attacking you R !!!they are trying to help... When ever..if and when you stop the gun ...you will still have to deal with withdrawal....the gum keeps you a junke to the addiction....    Unless you stay in the gum for life ....this is the fact ....

Redemption I'm really pleased for you that you have stopped smoking for 3 months. That really is a great achievement and you should be super proud.         With regards to NRT I have to disagree with you.  If you feel that taking NRT (possibly for life) is a good trade then you have mis-understood or don't get his addiction. That plan isn't a step forward it is a step sideways.        I have been using NRT for 6 days and my cravings have been pretty subdued. This isn't because my quit is going great, it's because I'm still giving myself nicotine. The theory with NRT is that you use it to get yourself past those first tricky days/weeks. It gives you a bit of time to get used to not smoking but then you have to deal with that physical withdrawal. NRT isn't a long term plan.      Sazerac isn't an NRT hater. She just believes it should come with a plan for coming off it.  I agree with her completely.       Anyway, I just logged in to tell you all that I'm struggling a bit today. I'm not going to smoke so no need for an SOS. I just feel a bit down, I keep getting those destructive thoughts creeping in and I'm exhausted. I'm not letting go of my end goal but it's consuming my thoughts from morning to night the last couple of days          Edited March 18 by Lilly
    Sorry you are having a tough day, Lilly.    Stay focused, you are building a strong quit    and we are behind you all the way.  Some days are just BAD, even in real life.      Soon, you won't have smoking or nicotine ruling your thoughts   and the sooner you can switch them up the better.   I know I waited far too long in purposefully replacing smokey thoughts with thoughts of beauty. Addiction really sucks  but, the recovery doesn't last forever, even though it seems like it at the time.   I promise, soon you will feel clean and clear and more confident and powerful than you can even imagine.    I promise.
    Thanks Saz.  I'm so emotional - I read your post and I burst into tears. I'm hanging on to every word and just praying for the worst to be over. I know it's early days I just wish this would pass.        It's so nice to come here and be around people who get it x
    Just keep telling yourself that this too shall pass Lilly, that's what I did. I hope your tomorrow is better 
If a person chooses to use the nicotine gum to quit smoking, it is irresponsible for anyone to advocate just "popping" a piece of gum whenever the craving hits. It is against this boards policy to support the use of nicotine as a replacement for smoking unless its use is to quit altogether.   Follow directions.  The Gum is a 12 week program.  The patch has a program as well.  Anything other than following the products directions is abusing the product and giving very poor advice.  You are only fooling yourself if you think you are not still addicted.        and one more thing.  Just sayin'......              NOPE is the way for me!
Thanks Jillar. I will definitely do that.       I actually feel a bit better being here.  It's really comforting xEdited March 18 by Lilly

    There are a lot of toxins leaving your system now Lilly; the first two weeks are the worst but they will pass.  Your body will heal itself if you give it a chance to do so after years of abuse.  Come here as much as you need, we are all wanting you to succeed.

    Lilly, I had some really sad days in the beginning.  I think we grieve the loss of smoking while we are quitting.  You are doing great and things will get better.  Stay close to the forum.  We are here for you!.
    Cigarette free and Nicotine free are two different things
    Thanks Linda.  The support here is so uplifting x
    Aw, Lilly, I know those down days are tough. Your emotions are all over the place in the beginning. I'm only just now starting to feel like I'm on a more even keel. But I'm so glad I was patient and didn't light up again! Hang in there. Please don't hesitate to send me a PM if you need a listening ear. I'm here for you!

This ^      I remember tears flowing in my early quit. I grieved the loss of cigarettes but more so I grieved for all the years I wasted believing I needed them. Believing I was ‘choosing’ to smoke when the reality was that I am an addict and the addiction was in charge.         Right now, you’re running low on dopamine because nicotine did the same job so you were not having to produce so much of your own. Your body will catch up and you will feel real joy without the crutch of cigarettes and IT IS WORTH IT. But that is a little further down the line. Don’t avoid the board while you’re sad. That is the best time to be here. Play the games, start a conversation, vent about the smoking or other life stuff that interferes. This place is perfect in these first months to distract you and reinforce your quit. It’s the place where you’re not alone and these people have walked your walk. You got this!
    I needed to hear that today.        I'm avoiding the board because I'm like a fiery ball of anger. I tore all the buttons of my shirt today because when I was ironing it I noticed a little pen mark on the sleeve. I had a fight with a pitta bread yesterday because the lettuce kept falling out.       I'm not going to smoke I just want to get past this part. It's like my quit has become groundhog day!!      Now I'm annoyed at myself for not being happy I haven't lit up. 
    Lilly, all those feelings are normal.  It is like your clawing to get to the other side.  There was about three weeks, during my quit, I did not think my husband would survive me.     Just know if you can keep going, it gets better each day.  Just keep hanging tough.     Don't not post.  We all understand because we have been there. I often found the humor on the forum got me through.  Give us the chance to help you through or make your smile.
    When you get frustrated and angry, go back to deep breathing. That and calming your mind are the best ways to relax and get "out of the moment". By the way, that's all normal. It will pass - just not as quickly as you'd like  
    Well I'm still going. Nobody is more surprised than me to be honest. I've not been happy at all but I've not once contemplated smoking. Today was Mother's Day and my children told me how proud they were of me not smoking  x
    It's a good feeling Lilly to have your kids proud of you ....This means a lot to me ...and keeps me motivated.... Well done ...
    Thanks Doreen xxx
    Lilly, I am so proud of you.  You are finally conquering the struggle.  I think you finally have this!  Keep that quit going. 
    Linda I wake up in the morning and I say I'm not smoking today but if I want to smoke tomorrow then I definitely will.      I think because I give myself the option it takes the pressure off a bit and obviously tomorrow never comes lol x
Oh hang on to that message, your kids being proud....if you do have an urge to smoke just remember how it felt when the kidlets told you they were proud of you.Edited March 31 by notsmokinjoKidneys are not kidlets...bloody auto correct.
    I am so glad you found something that worked.  I really think you have it this time.  You are only going to get more stronger and powerful.  
    I will Jo xx

    So it doesn't matter what stage of our quit we are in we are going to face triggers to wanting a smoke. The earlier you are in your quit the more triggers you will face and you will be surprised how many things you will learn were triggers and you didn't even know. So first rule of triggers avoidance... don't expect your triggers to be concurred over night, it took time to program your brain with all your smoking triggers its going to take time to unprogram them.     The first few days of quitting are often the most challenging. You’re likely to have strong regular cravings due to nicotine withdrawal and also from smoking triggers. Being prepared and knowing what to expect can make things easier. As each day passes the cravings occur less and less often. They grow weaker until you’re not thinking of smoking for days, then weeks, then months at a time. You just need to beat the triggers, outsmart the little buggers, and beat them into oblivion one by one.        Triggers are all those little habits, experiences, situations and feelings that you have learnt to associate with having a smoke. Some can just be avoided but some can't.      So change your routine.... I used to get up, fill the kettle and put it on as I went outside for my first hit... every morning it was the same thing....didn't matter if I needed the loo.... nothing happened before that first smoke.... so I switched it up... get up, go to the dunny, have a shower, then a coffee.... I changed the pattern, and the trigger lost its strength and went away. The whole first year was a master class in avoiding triggers, re-writing them, and deleting them from my mind. Everyone who quits faces triggers, some are the same, some are different.... so oldies and inbetweenies share you tricks of the trade with our newbies... how did you deal with your triggers.       Here are some tips from the quit people down under:  
    Great post Jo.!!!!  Change your routine ... Change your thoughts to positives ..instead of negatives .....

Once I saw that, it was so much easier to deal with triggers, or to respond in different ways other than lightening up.            Example, from back in october. At that point I thought I was done with morning triggers: 'Started with the SAD (seasonal affective disorder)  lamp this morning,  third year in a row﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿. Made myself a nice coffee and had some papers ready, to prepare for today. So I am sitting behind this absurdly bright light an﻿d suddenly this intense crave hits me... omg!!! In a flash I see myself lighting up, immediately having that 'Ahhhhh'moment﻿, so at first I'm all 'wtf is this, where does this come from, oh nooo'. Panick, 'Will this ever st....'﻿   And then it dawns on me. The lamp is HEAVILY connected with morning smoking rituals. Waking ﻿up, coffee, lamp, one or two cigarettes (the only ones﻿during all seasons I allowed myself to smoke IN the house,  as to ease and boost myself for REALLY doing this lamp thing, waddajamean fvcking up my reward system), and I kidd you not, the crave eases out the second I understand  the connection.    Knowing this intens 'wanting' is nothing more than a brainfart, a result of programming. Knowing that here and now, in this moment, I cut yet another tie with this darned addiction!      My tip would be to try to remove the emotional aspect of triggers, try to detach from that. Ofcourse, cry if you need to, because of the sudden surprise, or scare maybe. And after that comes healing. Each time a little bit more.         Edited March 26 by MLMR
    Great post Jo, thanks!  
    There is a saying-      "There is no extra credit for making quitting harder."      I avoided places where I would smoke for the first few months of my quit.
    I walked away from my husband if I thought an argument was brewing, as that was always a green light to go and smoke.   I refused to let myself get worked up to the point I knew I would be checking my purse to see if i had enough for a pack!               Great post Jo..Thank you.   
    I also tried changing my routine but the biggest thing I always did when a trigger hit was to identify all the circumstances around the trigger to identify and to learn so that I could handle them.  Also I had to learn the the farther into the quit the more "out of left field" that the triggers came from and that triggers come from anywhere.  Learn to live with them and to conquer them -- it gets easier!!!!
    If a big trigger happens to be excitement, maybe pester a room mate instead. Or aggravate the neighbor's dogs.      Yeah, my biggest emotional trigger is when I get excited, say like finding some awesome deal on ebay

Excellent post Jo as usual.     I always, always ask my trigger ( I actually have a mental conversation with it :p) what does it need? My attention on a memory? My celebration for something good? My anger on something wrong? Anxiety at work?Post the answer my trigger gives, I'm like, hmm and where would that be after the 7 minutes of puffing like a defunct coal engine? Nowhere so how about instead I give you a nice walk, or a cool drink (It's hotter than a pig's backside here right now) and by that time, my trigger has left the building.
    I love this Tammie. It’s actually enlightening listening to our minds trying to tell us something we always deadened it with cigs buts it’s actually something to be heard. Every day is a learning day
    Jo thank you for such a helpful post.       I always remember Jillar saying don't smoke in places you usually smoke before you quit. I stopped smoking in the car, at my smoking spot in the garden and my work grounds. I didn't find new regular spots, I smoked in completely different spots each time so none became habitual.         This really helped break associations before I'd even quit. 
    I'm being sent to a pulmonologist. My autoimmune disease is attacking my lungs. I can't breathe properly. I find myself gasping for breath during conversations. The other night my lungs were burning as if I'd sprinted up a hill, and all I was doing was sitting on my arse watching television. I feel like I can never get quite enough air. It's a truly terrifying feeling.     Please don't smoke. If you have quit, STAY quit. Keep that precious quit at all costs. If you are still smoking and thinking of quitting, do it now. Don't wait until you reach the point of no return. Your lungs are precious, and every breath is a gift.
    abby so sorry to read that you are having such a hard time. I am new here and don't know much about your quit but being a long time smoker myself I can feel the damage I have done to myself. I hope you find some relief from all that you are going through. My thoughts are with you. 
    Oh, abby !  I am so sorry you are going through this.   I can only imagine the panic you must feel.     Thank you for your posts, you help all of us everyday.  We have taken our breath for granted and are stupid.    Breath is the most important part of our survival.      Keep us posted.  Hopefully the pulmonologist will be able to alleviate your distress.
    Abby, I wish I had something insightful or at least helpful to add to the conversation.     That not being an option, I send you my best wishes and hope you're doing better soon.      Take care.
    I know how it feels to not be able to breathe Abby. Some of what you are going through could be your lungs cleaning out all the gunk from smoking. I remember when I first quit that my breathing got worse than when I smoked. So much so that I thought, why did I even quit! I do have asthma too though and it seemed quitting made it worse But my pulmonologist told me that my lungs were actually starting to repair themselves. Hopefully your pulmonologist will be able to assure you that's the case for you too and also give you something to help with your breathing. 
    Sorry you are experiencing this Abby. Frightening I'm sure but glad to hear your are going to see the pulmonologist. That's the Dr. that will be able to give you the best status report and treatment plan for your lung function. Will be thinking of you and hoping you get good results. Please keep us informed .... we care 
    Oh Abby, so sorry to hear this.  Please know I will be praying for you.  Please try to keep positive thoughts and concentrate on healing.   Please keep in touch.   Linda
    Ugh, that must be so scary. Sorry you are going through this.       Thanks for taking the time to write this down.. these are the messages that keep reminding me to do everything in my power to protect my quit.      Whishing you well, hope there's treatment for this ugly part of your autoimmune disease.        Take care!       
    I mirror all the above .... Hopefully with time ..the longer you stay quit ..the damage can be repaired ....take care Abby...
    Abby, so sorry that you're having to deal with this.  Being this is caused from an autoimmune disease, are they able to stop any of this?  Thanks for the wise words and the great reminder.
    I’m so glad you’re going to see a pulmonologist.  I hope you get some answers and relief.  Please keep us posted. 
    I too am glad you are going to see a pulmonologist, hopefully the doctor will be able to help you and find some answers.  I too have felt how bad my lungs have been damaged and it can be a roller coaster of a ride but my doctor has been helping me.  Good luck and keep us posted!!!!!
Not breathing or struggling too is a horrible feeling. After smoking close to 40 years it’s a wonder I can breathe at all. Our bodies must be tougher than we give it credit for. I hope they get you taken care of sooner than later. I just didn’t think it made any sense that you could quit smoking and breathe worse than what did while smoking.  I think that is one reason it’s been somewhat difficult for me of late. Best wishes Abby.

There are immunosuppressive treatments that can help stop my body from attacking my lungs, but unfortunately those drugs attack the liver. My rheumatologist is not a fan of using them unless absolutely necessary. I'm hoping the pulmonologist will have more answers and suggestions for treatment. I will keep everyone posted.        Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. I appreciate you all so much. ❤
    Just want to add my best wishes  for a quick, positive turnaround. Hopefully this is a temporary setback and you'll get some relief and be back on track very soon.  Your strength and amazing attitude will get you through this and we will be cheering you on every step of the way.

Hi Abby, just checking in to see how you are doing.  Have you seen the pulmonologist yet?  Hopefully they are figuring things out and getting you on the road to recovery.  Wishing you the very best and hoping that you're getting some relief from your symptoms. Edited March 26 by Jordan7
@Jordan7 Thank you for checking in! I have an appointment to see the pulmonologist on May 8. I'll keep everyone posted as to what I find out.       Right now I'm dealing with a nasty cold. Been in bed for a few days. I'm just so glad I don't smoke anymore! I can't believe I used to try to smoke when I was sick! Ugh!
    Hope you feel better soon Abby, xoxo. I used to gauge how sick I still was by how my cigarette tasted!
Well Abby at least you have been smoke free for almost 3 months -- that should help you with the cold that you have.  Glad you have the doctors appointment  you take it easy now and get better!!!!

That is a long G.D. time to wait when someone is having problems breathing.     If things get too bad, just get to E.R. A slightly achy tooth could wait several more weeks, lungs cannot.
    Hope you kick that cold soon.  Not what you needed, but hopefully it will be over soon.  Any chance you can get on a waiting list for an earlier pulmo appointment if they have a cancellation?
    I swear by this ...much easier than yoga....    I was introduced to this Chinese art very early in my quit ....its very relaxing and good for the mind and soul.....    You can follow it on  you tube ...try the beginners .....   I do a excersise every day ...       
    Great stuff Doreen! Going to give it a shot. Did some yoga years ago and I like this. Still looking for a warm and comfortable place though!
Doreen and I were talking, and realized our husbands are the same age, 66.  That is about the only thing they have in common.  I am going to tell you first about my husband, Dennis, and then Doreen will be along to tell you about Tony. Hopefully there are smokers who will read this who still have the opportunity to choose which husband and father they would like to be. Dennis is a never smoker.  At 66, he still works 40 hours a week.  He enjoys golf, and boating.  He maintains our home and houseboat.  As many of you know, this past year he and his 70 year old brother totally remodeled the upstairs of our home. They took the kitchen down to the studs and rebuilt (and Dennis was still working 40 hours each week).  Dennis recently walked his oldest daughter down the aisle with pride.  He loves life and has a wonderful laugh.  He takes medicine to control blood pressure and cholesterol, but is in great health otherwise.    Doreen will tell you about Tony, soon.
I carnt post pictures, but I'm sure Tony would not want you all to see how sick he looks...Tony has end stage emphysema... He smoked until he physically couldn't put a cigarette in his mouth and smoke it..It takes all the strength and breath he has ..to just get out of bed in the morning...with my help...After a rest...he needs my help to wash...shave..Chair lift gets him downstairs...gets settled in a chair..where he stays till we have a bedtime routine.Emergency ambulances ,and hospital is never too far away...lung infections are almost on going..Doctors fight to keep pneumonia at bay...Because his blood doesn't retain oxygen...he needs a machine 16 hours a day....Sleeping with the mask on and the machine going all night is only half of it...Tony relies on me for everything...as sooon as he tries to move ...he is breathless...I have watched him the last 14 years slowly get worse ,this is a very cruel illness.I have shortened this thread...I could write a book...Tony and I don't know just how bad this will get...we live our lives on a daily basis..If you are out there reading this...wanting to quit...please do it now..I thank Nancy ....brilliant idea..
This is very moving...thank you for sharing-Nat
Now tell them about your boyfriends.....
This is very moving...thank you for sharing-Nat Thanks, NatalieNow tell them about your boyfriends.....Everyone already knows all about you...
Goodness me Doreen just goes to show doesn't it? I only hope those thinking of quitting read that, don't brush it off as 'well it won't happen to me' because as your poor Tony has sadly found, it could and does. Thank goodness you stopped Doreen!
This is a very powerful post.  Thank you both for sharing.  I pray the message in this post is taken to heart by all who continue to smoke.  This is reality folks.  Smoking doesn't help you with stress & it's not your friend.  Smoking only makes you sick and anything you tell yourself to the contrary is just the addict talking.
Doreen and Namcy. Such a hard hitting post. Dorren, the sheer and utter madness of it is that even though he refused to quit smoking, eventually he couldn't physically smoke and he quit anyway! After all the pain and the hardship and suffering. Denial and refusal. The excuses and all that we all have done. He quit anyway.  I wonder does he miss smoking or wish he quit earlier?  Does he feel the same way you do now?  I'm so very very sorry for your situation. For both of you. But for a strange day in October 2015, I could be Tony 30 years down the line. Any one of us could. I think I thought I might be. When I allow myself to dwell on the insanity of smoking, the industry, the lies, the excuses we allow purses to make....... It's so..........pointless. My heart goes out to you. I'm glad you quit and have got healthier.  Nancy, I'm glad you were able to quit and join your husband in a shared future.  Thank you both for sharing your stories. X
PP..when tony first had his  diagnosis ....he was very much in denial....his head was firmly in the sand...His addiction took away any fear of what this illness entailed...He doesn't miss smoking now....he has more important things to think about....taking each breath....Our Xmas was shared with a lung team ,that came to see him every day...to try and keep him home for Xmas...I am so grateful ,relieved,happy....that I quit before the s***t hit the fan for me....I was so close....Never stick anything in your mouth ....and set fire to it....If anyone out there is reading this...that wants to quit....do it today....For those who have already quit....never doubt ....never miss it....Because your health is something you will miss more....if you lose it....trust me....I know..
Wow. Beautifully done ladies. My Dad was 59. The operation on the aneurysm went well.  Unfortunately smoking had reduced his lung capacity to the extent that they could not get him off the respirator. He caught an infection.  He never woke up.

Tragic...I know it still hurts....thank you for sharing.  So sad Stuart....so young....I'm sorry...  Thank you ladies. Just the way it is. The cigarettes don't care how old you are, who you are or what you have done. They kill you just as dead. Good news for anyone reading this is that you CAN quit. It is very doable.
wow- very powerful,,,  I am sorry for you,, and I love you all, I done even need to see you,, That's just how it is- I have lost people,,  and I have found you,, for everything we get,,, we give up something,,,, I truly believe- Thank you my quit train friends,,,,, for being,, RC

Loads of Brackets D.
Doreen-I'm so sorry you and your husband are going through this terrible time.  Thank both you and Nancy for this post. I'm still early in my quit, which has been reeaaaalllllllyyyyyy difficult for me. I'm going through a stressful time and just tonight was thinking I wish I had just one.  If I did, I could go outside, by myself and escape for a few minutes. But your tales have reminded me why I am working SO hard to stay quit. So, thank you for that. (And thankfully, all nicotine products have been removed from the house and I'm not craving enough to drive to the gas station because tonight could have easily turned into a slip for me).  Nancy- As a side note, where do you keep your houseboat?  We have friends who have a houseboat on Norris Lake and it's one of our favorite places to visit. 
I'm also saddened and sorry for Doreen and her husband. But when I see replies like I can do this, above me, I'm thankful for her strength in posting this, because I know how much it will help people, even if most of them never tell us. I can do this - you're doing amazingly! Whatever you're facing, face it down, and let your resolve grow even stronger. 
Thank you Nancy and Doreen for sharing.Cigarettes killed many in my family.  I thought they would end me too.
Time for a update...for those sitting on the fence...for those struggling and romancing the smoke...Those who know me well..know my story... If your new ...please take the time to read...it just might save your quit...OkTony went for his oxygen lever test today..to make sure the oxygen machines at home are set at the right setting..This is a very painful thing to have done...the out a needle in your wrist just abokve the top side of your hand..He cries out in pain...they take blood and test it...i find this hard enough to watch..i casn only imagine the pain involved..it turned out the 16 hours of oxygen on setting 4 is OK for now...The carers still come in every day...but they have cut his showers down...as it totally takes his breath away ,and he struggles to breath...He has been on two courses of antibiotics and steroids since the last couple of months..This is why our daughter has travelled  half around the world ...to nurse  her dad ,while I had 5 days away...This is what smoking does...Please....don't smoke....
Doreen, that really drives the point home concerning the way cigarettes destroy our health.  I know it must be difficult, but thank you for sharing your story. Best wishes to you, Tony, and your daughter.
Oh Doreen. Your story breaks my heart. Such wasted opportunity. I'm sorry you and Your husband have to suffer through this.
As sad as Tony condition is...thats not the reason I came to the board although it should have been..No my lungs were OK...I can breath OK...I havnt got c.o.p.d...so why should I quit...(numpty addict )...Something else sinister was happening to me...my blood was clotting around my ankles cutting off the blood flow..I just happened to be at the docs...hey take a look at my black ankles...Doc....do you smoke...Me....yes for 52 years...Doc...if you don't stop now...you will lose your feet for sure...This is what brought me to the board for support...The damage is not always obvious....Just take a minute to imagine...the nightmare our lives would have been ...Never take another puff....never....
Always in my thoughts and heart you guys. xx
Powerful stuff Doreen.  Glad you quit.  Glad you're here on the Train with the rest of us numpty addicts.
Doreen, My heart is with you! I'm pretty new here and am only on day 5 of no nicotine and this was such a heart felt post. I really respect you and respect your decision to share such an emotional part of your life. Thank you =)
Doreen, My heart is with you! I'm pretty new here and am only on day 5 of no nicotine and this was such a heart felt post. I really respect you and respect your decision to share such an emotional part of your life. Thank you =)Thank you...you fight for your quit...your life depends on it...It may be uncomfortable at the beginning...but so worth it...Post ,post... You will have support all the way...This is a very small support site to others...but this little family truly cares for each other..xx
Thank you Nancy and Doreen for starting this powerful post.I am very grateful to you both and to everyone posting.Truths like these help keep me Free.S
Bumping this...for mom...and anyone who doesn't understand copd /emphysema..Husband ?...wife ?...emphysema doesn't care ...the effects are the same....
Thank you for sharing this Doreen...yes, very powerful stuff and my heart goes out to you and your husband. I want to share your story with my mother. She has emphysema, diagnosed a few years ago. She is in major denial. Still smoking and blaming her awful coughs on "the weather, a chest cold" etc. it is already getting bad and she is on steroid inhalers, etc. but refuses to quit smoking. Reading your story, I kept picturing every detail you described, happening to my mother, and it made me cry. So sad. How to make her understand what will happen? Maybe I can't, but I want her to know what others are going through with this, thank you for sharing the truth and how it has affected your life.
Tony was in denial too brandy...he smoked until he physically couldn't smoke...He didn't need all the warnings...very sad xx
Tony didn't quit cigarettes.  Cigarettes quit Tony.   ...and only when they were "done" with him. 
I'm sorry, no words, just a big motivation. 
Tony didn't quit cigarettes.  Cigarettes quit Tony.   ...and only when they were "done" with him. This is so true..                 
Nancy has asked for a update ...We seem to be in a regular routine now,a couple of weeks without antibiotics and steroids, and then one week blast course..a continuous cough...just have to recognise when the cough could turn in to a infection..Keep infections and pneumonia at bay,is a daily battle...The lung  specialist can do no more...it's all about making him comfortable ..if he was younger and not as sick ,they could have took a lot of his right lung away...but it's gone past this stage..The c.o.p.d nurses are trying him with a volumer..a glass tube..which you breath your inhaler from..to see if it helps...He is at risk of going into hospital again..Of course this has also took its toll on me..its a constant battle...C.O.P.d / emphysema... This is a very cruel illness...that very slowly Robs you of your life..it leaves you with no dignity..All you have left is doctors,hospitals,carers,Don't even risk this happening  to you and your loved ones..If we had understood this terrible illness...it might have made all the difference..Knowledge...learn about this illness..understand it.And quit and stay quit.All my best xx
Doreen, I hate what you and Tony are going through, but your story and the bravery to share it make a powerful statement. If you are reading this and still wavering about quitting, stop it.  Education, commitment, and support will allow you to set yourself free from this dreadful addiction.  You will never regret quitting, but if you continue smoking you may be left with little more than regret. Today is the perfect day to quit.
Oh, Doreen,Emphysema is such a gruesome way to go and not just for the patient.You are a hero being a carer and this must just rip you up.It rips me up knowing you. Smoking and nicotine addiction is complete selfishness.We don't comprehend our loved ones having to care for us, having to watch and listen to us slowly suffocate.It is a horrible REALITY. Smokers, do you have children ?  wives,  husbands ?  friends ?We all have to die but, why are you choosing painful, ugly death ?You'll be the lucky one on pain meds while your family takes care of you, listens to you gasping, coughing.  Listening for the 'rattle'.Then, you'll be the lucky one, DEADwhile your family recovers from the horror you put them through. Please quit.  It isn't hard.  It won't kill you.  
Thank you friends..for your never ending support..it helps me so much through the bad times..xxx
Thinking of you and sad that we didn't see the light sooner, all of us and those we love. x
Nancy and I have agreed to post a update here..Tony,s physical health is stil how it was..he still depends on me for all his needs..We are now worried about his mental health...he has lost interest...sometimes it's a battle...he carnt be bothered,Everything is too much effort..,so this brings agitation on both sides..If I mention resbite..to give me a rest ..he gets upset..he wants to stay with me...We have been married 46 years..and have never been apart..so i can understand...But it's so hard...C.O.P.D.,/ emphysema... You can live for years suffering ...If posting this thread helps that one person from relapsing ,or helps you decide to quit..This is what i intended...This is what smoking does..don't let it be you xxI'm sure Nancy will update ,when she can..
>Wipes tear away and clears throat Thank you for the courage it took to share with us.  
My heart breaks for you and Tony, dear friend.  It is horrible what the addiction has done to your family. Since I last updated on Dennis, he has retired.  He is still in excellent health, and is now helping his brother remodel his home.
Thank you sweetheart..Good to hear Dennis is enjoying his retirement..and when it's your turn to retire too,you will have happy times together ..that's the way it should be..xxxx
So very touching and personal thank you for sharing because it is very important for us all to understand the end results of this evil habit. Will keep you in my prayers.
I have nothing to add here that others haven't already said to you Doreen. I do want to thank you for sharing your terrible journey and please do keep this one updated for newbies like me. I just read the whole thing today and it does have a profound affect on those of us who are just starting out in our new smoke free lives - it does help us!Lots of love to you my dear - you're a very special lady  :wub:   
Thank you for your kind words...R if it makes your fight here stronger..I'm happy to keep it going...It's helping good folk like yourself...kick this dreadful addiction for good..
Time for a another update...    Been up all night again....Tony,s health took a nose dive...his blood is not holding a steady rate of oxygen ,if fell to 80 /%. This causes all kinds of problems.. Which can lead to cardiac....confusion... Tired....feeling all together unwell  He also is on the verge of any bout of phuomonia... So needs a whack of antibiotics.... Every time he gets phuomonia ,it weakens his lungs further....  Emphysema is not good  in extreme weathers....so this spell of extreme heat will not help....   So after doctors advice....he was taken to hospital by ambulance... Just when you think..yep.... Things are pretty crap just now...we have been thrown a huge spanner in the works...   He has recently been diagnosed with Vascular Dementia.... And is undergoing test to see exactly which part of the brain has been effected...    We already more or less know....it's the I don't care about anything part...which is found in the frontal area....but tests will proove this... Of course this will progress too....        If any one here is pondering whether they are doing the right thing...and miss a smoke....please read this thread from the beginning..  It's not just your life that gets ruined...your partner and your family suffer too....  Until next time.    KTQ....

    Oh Mammy my thoughts are with you both.     I'm sorry that you both have to go through this but I am thankful that you are sharing your experience because people really do need to know. Emphysema is an insidious disease and its effects on those with it and those surrounding them is horrifying.  I really hope that this serves as a "wake-up call" to anyone that nicotine is tempting and to those who are on the fence about quitting. 
    Damn. Doreen keep strong. Best wishes 
    Doreen, not much I can say other than thank you for having the strength to share this. Sending my love and best wishes. 
    I'm really sorry Doreen, i'll be thinking positive thoughts for you and Tony....  
    Thank you lovely peeps....  You guys keep me going ....I know I can come here...and find something to laugh about...even if it's laughing at myself ....    It's nice to know...friends are always at the end of pushing a few buttons...xxxxx
    Hi doreen, i was thinking, thats good you can still have a sense of humour throughout bad times. But i thought that might be inappropriate for me to say. But since you said it, thats great doreen. I cant begin to imagine what you are going through but glad you can still have a laugh somehow. Keep us posted and lets keep having a laugh too xx
    My love from Canada D! So sorry both of you are going through this. Wish we could do more to assist in some way.    If there were time travel, you'd be surrounded by kind, giving souls  Keep us updated please and take good care of yourself too.
    Doreensfree,        I appreciate the updates, It aids my resolve.       Can't say that's much of a consolation...my thanks.      
    I am sending you hugs, Doreen. I wish I could do more.
    For those who may not have seen...Doreen, never to cause you pain...just to help others
    Aww ..no worries Nancy ...glad you dug this up ...time for another update ...   Well you wouldn't have thought things could get much worse ..but of course they can .   A short while ago Tony was diagnosed with Alziemers/ Vascular Dementia.... This sent me in a spin for sure..... They have placed him in Middle stage ...i have been informed because of all his other illnesses and Emphysema... He will deteriorate much quicker ...   Who knows what our future holds....One day at a time ....

    I'm so sad to read this @Doreensfree,  I hope you find some comfort in knowing how much you're loved....xoxo
    It blows my mind how much pain and suffering is caused by nicotine. Thank you for everything you do and everything you are, my friend.
    So sorry to read your story Doreen. you and Tony are in my thoughts.    Take good care of you Doreen. I know first hand what looking after someone with mixed dementia is like. Very hard indeed. I looked after my Mother in law until she went into a home.   Take care x
    Doreen sending you and your husband lots of well wishes.        Thank you for being here and for giving us your time x
Sorry to hear of the latest news, Doreen ....very sad for you both. My thoughts are with you as you continue being the strong woman you are in caring for your husband, Tony, and doing what you do here in caring about all of us in our quit journeys. Simply amazing! Edited March 23 by Rozukigrammar? run on sentences? :)
    Oh Doreen, you are such a rock.  Not only do you care for all of us, you are caring for your husband.  I am familiar with what you are going through, our neighbor, living across the street, has the vascular dementia.  He also was a smoker, had lung cancer, went through radiation and then was diagnosed with the vascular dementia.      I so wish I lived close that I could be there for you.  Know that we are here to offer our prayers and be here to listen.  I so admire your strength and have been so honored to have you help me along my journey. Much love to you,   Linda
    Aww Thank you ...   I would never got through all this ,if it wasn't for my  Quit Train Friends...xx
Ok so I was so ashamed and was going to delete my account and hide forever and then I realised I really need your help and advice and I need to be accountable for my actions. So I’ll bore you with a little of my background. Hubby and I both smoke and both quit at the same time. This can be both supportive but also can be destructive as one of us will sabotage our quit and we know which buttons to press to achieve this. We also only smoke at home which means that we can go without smoking for periods of time and will wait to satisfy the addiction.    So the trigger this time was stress. I am in Christchurch and had one teenager in lockdown at school ( 5 minutes) from the shooting and another in lockdown at the nearby mall. Hubby bought the smokes but I didn’t hesitate to smoke one. It didn’t solve anything and it certainly didn’t help any of the families and didn’t get rid of the deep sadness I feel right now. We had to finish the packet being the true addicts which we are. So been back on the train for 2 days. Nope
Welcome back DizzyD - you were missed!  I can't tell you how deeply saddened we all were to hear of the tragedy in Christchurch. That was horrible and to have gone through what you did was something none of us would have wanted to go through. You have both learned a lesson about your addiction though by going through what you have - smoking makes NOTHING better, only make things worse. Carry that lesson forward and let us support you through your new, permanent quit. I understand why you feel bad about falling off the train but don't dwell on that. Just see it as a learning experience. What counts is that you keep at it until you find your freedom.        We're still here to support you. Let us give you a hand to board the train again             Edited March 20 by reciprocity
    So pleased you didn't delete your account here...and came back...   I'm sorry you have had to endure this horrendous act of cowardly action first hand ...my thoughts with everyone involved....    Take your seat D....buckle up.....your amongst friends here....who will support as best we can ...hugs x
If at first you don't succeed, try again! I'd guess 99% of us here did not manage to quit first time so we understand. Welcome back         You must have been terrified, I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
    Hi Dizzy        So you got off the train at the station and stretched your legs but you got back on the train before it left the station.       Sorry you lost your quit but congrats on requiting.     It just shows that no matter what the circumstances having a cig is never a help and that there is no such thing as just one for us addicts.         
    Welcome back! You have nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about regarding the relapse.  You’ve acknowledged it, time to move on.          Thank goodness your family is physically safe. The mental damage will take much time to heal if it ever does.  I’m broken hearted over the tragedy in Christchurch.  I’m so sad for NZ-heck- for all of us! 
    Welcome back DD. Don't dwell on the lost quit... its gone now, save your energy to focus on this quit, lets make it the forever one.        I'm sorry you were caught up in Fridays terror. Keeping you all in my thoughts and prayers.
    What a nightmare you lived through, Dizz.  I'm so glad you're safe and decided to come back. Good for you for jumping right back into quitting, and I believe you're going to make it stick this time. 
    So very sorry about the latest Terror.  It is all too sad.  Nicotine addiction is a fierce foe and you needn't feel shame or embarrassment over struggling with it. We are on your side and you will build a successful quick of this I have no doubt.   Please take very good care of yourself and hug your children extra tight.
    That must have been so scary for your family dizzyd. I'm glad your family is ok. And I'm glad you didn't delete your account! Congratulations on getting back on your quit. Remember that you are quitting for yourself first and foremost so if hubby buys another pack of cigarettes let him blow his own quit, not yours too.    Smokers love a "partner in crime" so your refusing to smoke any that he may buy will probably help him realize he can quit and stay quit too...
    Glad you are back dizzy and that you did not delete the account.  At least you committed to quit again and that is important.  My heart goes out to all of you in New Zealand -- It must be horrifying to go thru something like that.  Anyway take your place back on the train and know we will be behind you!!!
    Hi Dizzy and welcome back. I am so sorry for all you have been through. I too was ready to not come back. So glad I did. Only advise I can offer being so new here is stick around and if need be post an SOS if things get tough. These wonderful people saved my quit the other day. Had coat on and was ready to walk out the door and felt embarrassed to sos. But I did and it worked. So happy we are going to ride this journey together.     
    We are so glad to see you both back....we are a family....I'm proud of you both !!!!

    Doh ... Smoking is not an option. 
There's something that's bothering me for some time now and that is the grave importance of, well, EVERYTHING, since I quit. Its like I became 10 times as serious. I think I used to be more fun to be around.     All the reading and studying, Im pretty fed up with it, to be honest. I want my humor back, my non-planning, my go-with-the-flow and ... pretty much, my old me but without the smoking ofcourse. Let it be clear, i dont miss that for one second.     Do people recognize this and if so, when and how did you settle that?
    It'll pass MLMR, it's that first year quit thing and learning to adjust to our new normal. Once that first year hurdle is crossed you'll probably be able to relax and have fun much more easily  
MLMR I agree with Jillar above.  I went thru the same thing during my quit especially the 6-8 month part of it.  I started coming out the down and out and no fun type of thing in the autumn when I really began to notice all the benefits of no longer smoking one day when I was on the front porch and realized that I could smell all the things that make up the seasons.  From that point on I started getting used to "the new normal" and since then have been getting back to the new normal.  The first year you will see many changes and in the end you will be proud and glad that you did quit.!!!!!Edited March 20 by Martian5
    It's all Temporary.... I used to worry my personality had changed...gradually it can back ....  We spent years, decades feeding our bodies poisions..... It takes time to adjust ...    Doing over think things ....you are where you need to be ,just now ...look at the positives .....your free on nicotine at last ...
    You are building the foundation to a really wonderful life as well as a nicotine free one.  There will still be some growing pains but nothing radical. Just like everybody said, you will get to know the new you and you will just be a deeper, kinder spirit. Your capacity for fun will evolve, do not worry.
Of course everything is more important/serious now that our shutdown mechanism is gone. Go ahead and just dig on all the formerly unseen/ignored things now dancing in the forefront of consciousness. Quitting smoking really is a big deal, and so is this life. Just say wow.Edited March 20 by comrade simba
    How is our Chicklette doing ?????   We missing you .!!!!.....   Pop in soon ...we worry....!!!!!
    I woke up thinking the same thing. Check in @Icanhike, we worry.......
    I agree.  I hope all is well.       Hope so hear from you soon @Icanhike
    Also hope @DizzyD and @kallisonmk check in soon as well.    We're a bit like mother hens here when it comes to new quitters. We get worried when you stray too far from home  
    I hope her ribs are ok.         Come back soon 
    Thinking of you ICH..... Hope all is well with you and the family. 
@Icanhike! It's so good to see you, we were all so worried. How are you?
    Oh my Heavens, you guys are spectacular!   You have hearts of gold!   Every day, I've been meaning to get online, but a weird thing happened.  I woke up one morning with a phenomenal burst of energy, and I've been doing chores and projects like a madwoman for a week straight.  And at the end of the day, I sit on the couch and turn on my computer, but I'm so wiped out I fall asleep immediately.  I'm finally burning out, and sick of sleeping on the couch.   I'm suddenly looking back at my life, which was spent smoking,  and sorry that I missed out on the rewards of being productive.  And my aching lung is getting better every day;  it seems to have been from the injury when I fell.  But it scared me so much that I've been on a major health kick, no more junk food.  Sooooo, that's the update.  I hope you're all doing well, and a thousand "thank you's" for thinking of me!!!   hugs
    Thanks for the update icanhike, and I'm glad you're lung is getting better 
    Glad to see you back with your quit still intact

Stay focused and don't fear any random, errant crave or trigger just protect your quit with your life.
    Hi Icanhike and thanks for your update. New here and was so encouraged by your post. Always glad to read when someone a bit further along in their quit is doing so well. Keeps me motivated. 
Many will cough more after quitting,    here is our friend, Joel Spitzer, explaining why.Why Many People Cough More After Quitting      Video discusses cilia repair that occurs after quitting which often results in an increase in coughing  and he has a lot of links on Cilia repair, etc.Edited March 19 by Sazerac
Hubby quit!!!!!! Was three weeks Thursday!!!! And........I am still alive He did a patch for 4 days, nrt gum for 2 weeks.....I am so HAPPY!
    Great news, you stand as the role model and showing him how it could be done.   Congrats and happy for you and the hubby!!!
    Congratulations to you and your husband.        The freedom is contagious.
    That's great news Parsley! Having both of you quit is fabulous. You'll be able to give him a lot of tips on how to deal with things too because you've already been there; done that!
That's fantastic parsley! I'm really happy for you  Tell hubby congratulations from the gang on the train Edited March 18 by jillar
    Great news, so good to be free together 
    That is awesome, Parsley!  Congratulations to both of you!
    What happy news, Parsley !   
    Congrats!
    Brilliant news ...  Well done MR Parsley ...

    Craves coming one after another. Doing deep breathing, pacing and just feeling rotten. Went from energetic to feeling just beat. Getting a minor throbbing sinus headachey feeling with a drippy nose. Could be my sinuses are clearing?  Geez up one day down the next. Some tightness in the chest but thinking it is still anxiety. Drinking water and juice. Ate a little something which seems to help. Almost to the point of having a good cry. Keep reminding myself that this is part of healing and that in order to come out the other side I must deal with these things and keep fighting.     This is not an sos but just a rant to keep me motivated. It helps to write it all down.     A friend gave me some of those marshmallow peeps and I think I am gonna go and bite their heads off and then take a nap.    Refuse to smoke but withdrawal sucks. There now I feel better already. 
That's the way to do it desperate1, vent all you need and get it out! The chest tightness is normal, your lungs are already trying to start clear that gunk out. The tiredness too is normal. Sweets help a lot with keeping blood sugar up so indulge yourself. It's very important to listen to your body during these first few weeks. If it's hungry, eat. Tired, sleep. It's working hard on trying to  repair all the damage done by our years of smoking. You're doing great!
It can suck the first few days and is a struggle but it can be done and you are showing that it can be done.  Keep up with the advice that you have been given and are following -- it will help.  It will get better (slowly), once you get thru the first 72 to 96 hours you get past the physical symptoms.  From what you say about how you feel seems pretty typical from withdrawing from smoking.  You are strong and can do this.  Great on posting and post as much as you want -- it can really help!!!!
    Hey D! Unfortunately, it's all part of the early days. Do what ever you have to NOT TO SMOKE. That's really critical at this point. Cry your eyes out or come here and rant & rave. We don't mind and it'll be good for you.        If you end up waking at crazy hours of the night with nothing to occupy your mind, come here and go to the games page. You can get lost there for hours playing whatever games strike your fancy. I spent hours there in my early days. You are going cold turkey I believe. I did as well. Those first days were challenging for sure but, you CAN do it. 
    Good for you having a rant on here.         It's horrible how our emotions are all over the place when we quit smoking. I enjoy having a nice bath with a few candles - it's good for the soul.         I have recently discovered podcasts. I downloaded an app called castbox so I pop on my headphones and just listen for hours. There's so much choice and so many subjects to choose from. You said on your profile you liked true stories and there's loads of those.        You're doing great 
It gets better desperate1, lilly gave you an idea. Serial is a podcast if you like true crime.. Take a nice long walk or workout, keep yourself/mind busy on other things
    Shut up whiner.....just messing.    you will live and it will suck at first say NOPE a million times, it helps  time will drive you crazy, you will have more on your hands and grow bored, so move around. Walk or just do laundry.  Keep busy.    sleep will come and go  chin up Keep Marching
    Lol bacon. I was like what. Thanks for the laugh...needed that 
    Change your name now. Everyone getting to know someone called desperate. Your no longer that.  Don’t use cat in the name either. Cat lady. Cat lover. All bad       Bubbles.  That’s one never used     Dolly was used once...maybe.  Think it might have been Daisy.       Either way pick a name name you like so we get to know YOu.  Not desperate 
    Maybe you shouldn't talk about biting off the heads of bunnies - Jillar might get nervous!      Take it one day at a time, one hour at a time, one moment at a time - you can do this.      My go-to time kill was forum games - find what works for you.       You don't sound desperate at all, you sound committed, keep that positive mindset!      Glad to hear you have been reading, educating yourself about this addiction will bring you the strength needed to separate the truths from the lies.        You are doing great!  KTQ
    Sounds familiar.  Yuck.  Make it a memory by not smoking. Smoke & the vicious cycle continues.   Peeps over poison sounds like a good plan! beazel is right- the games are a great distraction.         Keep up the good work! 
    You are doing great work, D !   Keep your focus.    You quit smoking.   Reward yourself.        You will find that certain craves actually have nothing to do with smoking, they are signals from your body that you are  Hungry,  Angry (emotional),  Lonesome (bored), or  Tired. H.A.L.T.    These bodily needs were gangstered by nicotine and we often just lit up instead of acknowledging  them. Here are two threads that address this.Riffing on H.A.L.T   andHALT      
I walked, went to the sos board, learned how to make hummus to dip stupid vegetables in when eating something was all that was left, outside causing harm to others. Lol. Then I walked some more. And some more. I would suddenly leap up at work and go walk around some buildings. It helped to know that most craves last around 3 minutes, though they seem to last 3 hours. I just had to beat basically a soft boiled egg.       There are are so many jokes I could end with here...
Thanks Aine for the advise. Love hummus by the way. Jokes are always helpful. Keep me upbeat.   Bacon maybe Dolly Bubbles or Daisy Duke I'll stay away from bunnies for sure beazel.    Ty lust4life and Sazerac. Every suggestion helps.
    Hi Redemption and thanks for the tip. Some of those jump out of your skin feelings are brutal. So far I have gotten up and paced and deep breathing exercises have helped. Coughing has started today. I notice that when I suck on a peppermint candy and do the breathing exercise it seems to mimic smoking somehow. Works for now. Just a soothing feeling. But know I will have to stop that. Don't want to keep thinking of smoking. This too shall pass. Hanging in there
    I used ordinary regular gum D....it kept my mind and my mouth busy ...you have no nicotine in your body now ....    No reason to put it back .....your clean ....it's just you and your mind now ...your stronger than any crave ...outsmart it ....keep busy.  Nope !!!!!
Congratulations !   You already have most of the nicotine out of your body  and will find the power to crush your craves and triggers !     Expect some discomfort and learn new skills to handle them.     Be kind to yourself.    Reward yourself with every crave you beat.  Drink water.    Use Jillars Air Cigarette or a stick of cinnamon.   Drink juice, keep your blood sugar up.      Do anything but bring nicotine back into your life. You are winning and we are all so proud of you. S            Edited March 18 by Sazerac
    No I have no intention of putting nicotine in me again. Am drinking tons of water and using the peppermint candy. Also have some regular gum. Chomping away on it. Also eating those marshmallow peeps and doing jillars air cigarette...it helps. Just the peeps jillar...no bunnies. Going to watch videos. 
            The enemy is our addiction to nicotine.  
    Quote taken from The Harmful Effects of Nicotine        "Nicotine poses several health hazards. There is an increased risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal disorders.  There is decreased immune response and it also poses ill impacts on the reproductive health.    It affects the cell proliferation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, DNA mutation by various mechanisms which leads to cancer.   It also affects the tumor proliferation and metastasis and causes resistance to chemo and radio therapeutic agents."
    Quote taken from The Oral Cancer Foundation's article,   Cancer Risk of Nicotine Gum and Lozenges   "Scientists have discovered a link between mouth cancer and exposure to nicotine,   which may indicate that using oral nicotine replacement therapies for long periods could contribute to a raised risk of the disease.    A study funded by the Medical Research Council, led by Muy-Teck Teh, of Queen Mary, University of London,   has found that the effects of a genetic mutation that is common in mouth cancer can be worsened by nicotine in the levels that are typically found in smoking cessation products"
I think sometimes telling ourselves and others why we quit to begin with can help hold us accountable.  I quit for a lot of reasons,  being diagnosed with COPD, Not wanting my son to pick up the habit, and the fact that I was just tired of it top the list.
My simplest answer is that I truly hated smoking.  Everything about it sucked and I couldn't see anything positive to doing it.  For a long time all I could think about is how much I hated smoking but I kept doing it.  Eventually I got sick with a respiratory thing and that sealed the deal.  I woke up one morning 4.5 months ago and just didn't smoke. The rest is history.
I quit smoking so it didn`t rob me of my mobility or increase my chances of diseases and ill health for later in my  life.
Hmmm - Clearly need to work on my tech skills One word. FREEDOM!
This is what I meant - I hope....  
Mine was being a slave to checking my purse each day, for the money needed to fund it.
I was at risk of having my feet amputated......can you imagine that.....I like them just where they are....on the end of my legs......not in the dust bin.....Also my hubby on oxygen......What a right pair we would have looked like.....At least I can still do the shuffle.....Well sort of
I was tired of something so stupid controlling me.  I was smarter than that addiction but I was a prisoner.  I wanted freedom I knew that some day I would quit.  Whether it was forced upon me or by choice.  I preferred the latter.  It was a great choice!  FREEDOM ROCKS!
To increase the chance of getting pregnant.  But I know that it is so much more than that now!!
I quit smoking for the same reason I started smoking. It was a choice. I chose to smoke. And 35 years later I chose to quit. I hold myself accountable for all of my choices, good or bad.
 I had a multitude of reasons that began piling up......outweighing the dysfunctional voice of addiction.......but this, this little man was the icing on the cake. He was what gave me the final push I needed.

I really admire your courage and good humour!
I was constantly having to clear my throat.  It drove me crazy.  It was gross and embarrassing.  I could barely get a sentence out. 
I don't like doctors.
Thanks stu....I pray.....I havnt left it too late.....We would have both been in a wheel chair.....who pushes who....If you try picture it.....it would be funny.....bit like...Wheel chair towing....l.ol
To fix a problem.  I knew I would one morning when I was coughing so hard that I couldn't smoke my first cigarette.  I would take half a puff then start a coughing fit again.  I was getting really pissed that I couldn't smoke my cigarette in peace because of the constant smokers' hack.  Smoking a cigarette was battled to a standstill by cigarette smoking's effects and my poor body was the battleground.  At that moment I thought of way to solve this problem!  ( If you are not a nicotine addict the problem seems pretty easy to fix. )
There are really lots of reasons to quit! 1. Health2. Money3. Family4. Smell5. Freedom
So many reasons! I think I originally decided to quit because I was sick. I was also sick of making myself sick from smoking. At the time of my quit, I had been sick for about a week with a terrible throat thing that just did not want to go away. I was still smoking, even while sick. I got to the point where I asked myself WHY. Why was I making my situation worse? I'd smoke and cough... and cough... and cough some more! It was terrible.  I was lucky to have amazing support from my never-smoker boyfriend. He was great. I don't think I would have been successful without him to be honest. My entire family smokes and it would have been very difficult for me to do so being around them.  There are many reasons I quit. Health was a big one, followed by watching some of my loved ones suffer with illnesses. Money was a big factor too. My addiction was so bad, I replaced food with smoking sometimes. Talk about mental!
I didn't like the smell of burning cigarettes.
i didnt want to die at 56 like my dad did and didnt want to be on a mechine to breathdidnt like the morning coughingdidnt enjoy smoking anymore
High blood pressure, high cholesterol, impending diabetes, and imminent heart attack . Doctors Orders: Sarge Must Not Smoke! And so he quit.    Easy Peasy
I wanted to make 50 and beyond smoke free.
What a great thread to re-read :) 
I quit because....I wanted too.I stayed quit because of some of members here helping, and someone in real world said "You'll start again." Proved them wrong.....asshole.
I was starting to suffer shortness of breath, my teeth were in a bad way, my oldest kept begging me to quit and I was really ashamed to be a smoker, hated stinking soo much.Vanity aswell, noticed I started getting a few wrinkles, yellow teeth, hair wasn't in great condition, yellow fingers, coughing.
I quitted  because I was at risk oh having both my feet amputated......due to no circulation....This freaked me out....I finally realised having two feet were better that 20 cigs a day....Plus hubby on a oxygen machine most of the day.....One could say..I woke up and smelt the coffee....
I stay quit for my above reasons 
I quit on my 39th Birthday so I'd be a year long non smoker by 40. Still not smoking over a year later.
I quit cause I love my kids and I want to be with them as long as possible.  I also did not want them the see me die a horrible death. keepin on
Newbies..and not so newbies..add your reason..its good to look back on ....
Not sure why i quit, but i somehow managed it, so now i have a crap ton of reasons to not go back. And i wont. Seriously, who wants to go back to smoking??
I finally got fed up with smoking.  Planning my every waking hour around smokebreaks was a pain in the ass.  It felt like the Marlboro Man had taken the helm and I was just along for the ride.
I think part of the reason was also that I wanted to see if I could actually do it because I knew it would be really tough. Sounds weird but I like to challenge myself from time to time and that has ended me up in hospital twice in my lifetime with serious injuries so I figured that this challenge would either have no effect on my life if I failed or, it would benefit me if I was successful. I know that's strange but as long as it works out; it's all good :)
I quit because....I wanted too.I stayed quit because of some of members here helping, and someone in real world said "You'll start again." Proved them wrong.....asshole. Hmmm... If he helped you to stay off the smokes then are you entirely certain that he deserves that honorific?

I was thinking about asking this question today,    Why Did You Quit Smoking ?      Glad I found this thread.   Good to read all the anecdotal evidence and see the nascence of many successful quits.      I quit smoking on a whim and as a challenge to myself.  I considered myself a strong/powerful woman but, it was slowly dawning on me that I was just a slave to nicotine.       I was curious to see if I had the muster to quit.   I did.  You do too !            Why did y'all quit smoking ?         Edited March 16 by Sazerac

I was one of those dummies who smoked in my house. Now with all this anxiety I am feeling I decided to get up tomorrow and start scrubbing some walls to keep me busy. Can anyone tell me how to get nicotine off walls and what to use to get some of the smell out of my house?  At almost 16 hours in am really anxious but hanging in there. Drinking lots of water and by going through posts and watching videos at why quit has helped immensely. So glad I found this train. Just having so much of this antsy feeling. As if I need to get up and move. Sorry if I seem to be rambling on. Just need to keep busy.
    When I became I homeowner I quit smoking in my house but in the rental houses before that I used TSP to scrub the walls. It's a powder that you mix with water and it did a good job at getting rid of the nicotine. You could probably even use Simple Green mixed with water and it's got a nice smell too  The antsy feeling is totally normal. I wish I had of got that instead of the tired feeling. I was too exhausted to even think about doing anything. So when you're done doing your stuff and are feeling antsy still, come on over and clean my house 
    No need to say sorry, good for you  to reach out.       Its been a long time since i smoked in the house, but I remember I put cups of water with vinegar in the house, vinegar attracts odours (and flies!). I even sprayed it on the couch. The smell of the vinegar itself diasappears after a while.        Windows open, curtains in the washing machine... enjoy!
    Ty Jillar. Will look into getting some. I know that my attempted quits(lasting not even a day) I would be extra tired. Now this one is different. I think its way too much coffee. So cut that out for today. Will gladly do yours next if it helps keep the quit.  Thanks MLMR vinegar it is. 
Be careful with coffee.         "Anyone who feels jittery after a few days of quitting should examine his or her caffeine consumption levels. Many find that they cannot tolerate caffeine consumption at prequit levels," says Spitzer. "If you are experiencing a jittery feeling you may want to experiment with reducing quantity or strength of caffeinated drinks or products."    https://whyquit.com/pr/041407.html
It gets all over everything, i just re painted the walls.           The White Vinegar Solution  More than one method removes tar and nicotine cigarette stains from walls. Start by adding warmed vinegar to a spray bottle for tough stains. Dilute using a one-to-one ratio with warm water for less noticeable stains. Apply the warmed vinegar or mixture directly to the walls. Because tar and nicotine develop a sticky and hardened surface, the warmth of the vinegar helps to soften these substances. Vinegar removes both smells and stains.    The Ammonia Method  Ammonia can also remove cigarette tar and nicotine from walls when mixed with water. Combine a tablespoon of ammonia for every cup of water, or roughly 1/2 cup of ammonia to a gallon of warm water. For painted walls, reduce the mixture to 1/4 cup to a gallon of water. For a stronger solution, increase the ammonia to a full cup. Apply the cleaning agent directly to the wall and let it sit for about five minutes before wiping it off. Follow with a clean rinse of warm water.    For Tough Cigarette Stains  Trisodium phosphate works best to get rid of tough stains because it also degreases the tars from cigarette smoke. You can find trisodium phosphate where you normally purchase household cleaning agents or at your local home improvement or hardware store. Wear gloves when you apply it to the walls after mixing 1 tablespoon in a gallon of warm water. To avoid streaks, start at the bottom of the wall and work your way up. Let the mixture sit on the walls before wiping it off. Rinse with a sponge dipped in clean water, changing the rinse water often as you work. Once walls are clean, they might require a primer and paint coat to freshen them up. Choose a primer product that can cover tough stains.  The Smoky Smell All of these solutions can remove the cigarette stink from the walls, but the smell may linger inside the home and recontaminate the walls if you forget to clean the filters for the home's HVAC system. As you clean the walls, ventilate the house thoroughly. If the house has a whole house fan, turn it on or temporarily set a large reversible square fan inside a window to vent the household air outside. Remove and clean washable cold-air return filters or replace them completely. Clean the grates around the cold-air return to remove tar and nicotine stains. Clean the carpet and drapes thoroughly to get all the offensive odors out of the home.
    Thank you Whispers. Awesome and thorough reply. Very helpful. Yes I have called it a day on the coffee. Hope I can get some sleep tonight!!!
    I smoked in my house too. The smell goes away.  I laundered everything I could with a big spash of white vinegar or baking soda and would have a spray bottle handy.    Once things were pretty clean, I soaked small strips of cloth in peppermint or lemon grass oil or orange oil or what ever you like....lavender ?    and tied them to the front of a few house fans.     If you want fresh paint to stick you should wash with Trisodium phosphat﻿e (TSP) anyway.   Wear gloves. I scoured my house top to bottom during those first weeks/months.   Sure wish that chick would show up once in a while now !        Make sure you look at the link from @MLMR   which addresses the changes in caffeine tolerance when you quit smoking.     
    I’ve never smoked in my own residence (except my parents).  I remember as a pre-smoking teen helping dad clean the kitchen to prepare for painting.  We used a common household cleaner called Spic-N-Span which worked great on the walls and cabinets.   Had to change the water constantly as it would be black with a dozen rinses of the sponge.   Use a nice big sponge when cleaning and then throw the spong away when your done        Dad was under no illusion of what caused the yellowed walls but Mom kept trying to say it was the furnace that caused it, like we were burning coal or something.                
    Lol Wayne. I sure remember spic and span. Thanks for your input. Will try all the above. 
100% smoked in my house...vinegar in a bowl extracted the smell. Scrubbing all the shiz in my house gave me a new lease of life. Both
    Marti I will put out a bowl tonight.  
    I dunno how it worked? Tres odd! But was ever so greatful! The car however needed selling so there's that lol. 
    Industrial grade de-greasers cut the yellow/brown tar stains on everything.     EZPZ
    Thanks sgt.  Will keep that in mind. 
Wow! Lots of input here on this one      Here's my 2 cents worth:   Freshening the smell - get fabric items in your home cleaned - carpets, drapes fabric covered furniture. That's what holds the smokey smell the most.       If your walls are stained, by all means wash them down with whatever you like but understand that you may have to repaint depending on the paint finish on the walls you're washing. Do a small test spot first and let it dry completely to see if the paint color changes. Flat or eggshell finish (most often used in living areas/bedrooms/closets) do not wash well. They may end up streaky and faded after washing. Gloss or semi - gloss finish (most often used in kitchens & bathrooms) withstands washing pretty well.       Keep yourself occupied and stay focused on your quit. That's job 1 for now      .
    I would just slap a coat of paint on in every room. It will keep you busy and the house will smell divine.      Buy one of those small steamers and run it over the carpets and then just wash everything before you put it back in the room.                    
    Recip thanks for your input. Figured anything to keep busy will help. Plus doing something helps curb pent up anxiety.  Lilly you must have read my mind. Decided to start painting at least some of house. I can afford some paint now with extra money I have now
    There you go. Fresh coat of paint as a reward for quitting. Love it!
Last night I got my ECG results in an email: abnormal ECG. Evidence of possible myocardial infarction (heart attack), age unknown. I can only take comfort in the fact that it must have been very minor if it indeed occurred. I'm scared out of my wits waiting for the cardiologist to call and explain further. I hope she doesn't keep me waiting too long. There is an extensive history of heart disease in my family. One thing is certain:     I WILL NEVER SMOKE AGAIN. EVER.     In other news, today is my birthday.  The big 42! (Nerds across the galaxy will understand the significance of that number.) I'm happy to be celebrating it smoke free!Edited March 13 by abbynormal
    Hi      I hope its good news .      Whichever way at least you are determined not to smoke again.       PS I loved Douglas Adams (Sad I know)
    Oh Abby that is not the present you had hoped for today.        You really have done the best thing you could have done for your health by quitting smoking.        I'm praying that the Cardiologist gives you some good news.         Please let us know what they say xx
    Hey, Abby.  Sorry you are on tenterhooks waiting for the Doctor, stressful Birthday !   Keep calling her back and often !  so, you don't get lost between the cracks.       Remember to Breathe and do something to reward yourself today.  Make it something extra soothing.   Maybe an hours long bath with a martini in hand or, cocoa ?
    Hoping for the best result for you Abby.......  Pamper yourself ...it's your Birthday ...   Good to hear  you will never smoke again ..x
    We can't change decisions we made in the past. All we can do is make better decisions today and .... you have done that by committing to a smoke free future  
    Sorry for the bum news Abby, thank goodness it was  minor! And thank goodness you quit smoking!! I hope your birthday gets better...……..
    Sorry to hear this, Abby.  I hope you get good news from the doctor.        And yes, this is a huge reason to stay smoke free. 
    I agree it must have been minor- or they would’ve seen you in person to discuss the results or send you for further testing STAT.  Nonetheless, super scary to read that news.  How great is it that you are already a non-smoker?? One less thing to worry over or change. You can focus on other things.      Your recommitment to stay smoke free is the best present (especially birthday) you could give yourself! Great job!      Happy Birthday and cheers to many more! 
    Happy Birthday to you Abby and a good one to be smoke free.  Sorry about the news but one of the best things that you can do for this is to quit smoking and that you have done, will help your heart greatly (know from experience and I am kind of going thru the same thing now).  As said above could be minor or they would have had the discussion face to face. I am sure your cardiologist will have more to say to help you along.
    Happy Birthday Abby and my best wishes and prayers for good news for you.
    Abby Normal!  Happy birthday, and remember you are still very young!  I'll be thinking happy, positive thoughts about your heart.  Thank God you quit smoking already, you've done a great thing for your health.  I hope you do something fun for your birthday, you are in my thoughts!

How Addiction Hijacks Your Brain    By The Fix staff 03/06/19 Sponsored What we know, and what is still a mystery.  It’s impossible to talk about addiction and recovery without considering the effect that substance abuse has on the brain, and how brain changes wrought by addiction can affect a person’s ability to get and stay sober.  “The brain is the main player in addiction, and countless areas of the brain are affected. Addiction is a disease of the brain,” said Beth Wright, a therapist intern at MFI Recovery Center, which provides affordable rehab for people with substance use disorder in California. “When we are using substances we are tampering with our brains and all the amazing natural chemicals in it.”    Understanding how addiction affects our brains and the chemical communications that take place within them can help people understand the process of addiction and recovery.    How Does the Brain Become Addicted? Although there is still an idea that substance use is a choice, science is making it clear that addictive substances change the make-up of our brains, making it more likely that people will continue to use substances even if it does them harm. “While addiction professionals and addicts understand that addiction is a chronic disease, often an individual who has never struggled with addiction will frustratingly argue that addiction is a matter of willpower,” Wright said. “Addiction occurs in incredibly intelligent, high-functioning individuals and does not discriminate. It is not a matter of sheer willpower.”  This is because addiction affects two important systems in the brain: the amygdala, which controls conditioned learning and affects our feeling or rewards, and the frontal cortex, which affects decision making, judgement and much more. “Brain structure and function are both altered by addiction. An addict becomes trapped in the endless cycle of craving, intoxication, and withdrawal, which leads to cravings, intoxication and withdrawal – the endless cycle,” Wright said. This becomes worse over time. “The more the individual uses a substance, the greater the damage done to the brain,” Wright said. Rather than thinking rationally, a person’s decision making becomes dominated by their need to get the next dose of their drug of choice.    “The individual in the simplest terms becomes motivated by the reward system, and all rational thinking becomes secondary,” Wright said. “Motivation for all behavior begins coming from the addict believing the drug is needed to survive, which is the mid-brain running the show and overriding any rational thinking our frontal cortex would normally suggest, such as not selling all of our family’s jewelry for meth, or spending our last dime on a gram of heroin when we are late on our rent.” In addition, facing life without the drug becomes unbearable. The person who is addicted believes that they need their drug of choice to survive, and that becomes the primary driving force in their day to day lives. “The desire for the drug will override the need for food, shelter, sex, our basic human needs,” Wright said.    Repairing the Dopamine System   Dopamine is a brain chemical that is naturally released when we experience pleasure. However, drugs flood the dopamine system. To attempt to regulate this, the brains of people using drugs will stop producing dopamine and eliminate dopamine receptors, Wright said.    This can make it tough when people with substance use disorder enter a drug treatment program and get sober, since they don’t feel the same dopamine hit from regular activities like music or physical touch.  “If and when an addict decides to enter recovery and stop substance use, the brain needs time to begin producing its own natural dopamine and begin repairing receptors. We have to patiently wait as our brain heals itself and we have usually by this point depleted our natural ‘feel good’ chemicals in our brains,” Wright said. “This takes time, where with addiction, the dopamine surge is immediate. Instant gratification is what every addict becomes accustomed to, hence the horrible relapse statistics.”   People in recovery also need to retrain their brains to remember not just the euphoric high of their drug of choice, but also the real negative consequences.   “Recovery will involve uncovering and challenging the addict to face memories or ‘triggers’ such as seeing a needle or a bottle of alcohol, and with time the implementing of new behaviors and creating coping skills in order to rewire the brain,” Wright said.  The Unknowns About Addiction and the Brain  How exactly drugs affect the brain depends on many factors, including what type of drug a person uses.  “This is the absolute simplest way of describing the brain. So many fascinating and terrifying changes can occur in the brain during substance abuse depending on numerous factors – age of onset, mental health disorders, substance being abused, etc.,” Wright said. Methamphetamine use can cause psychosis in an individual who previously has not had mental health issues. Alcoholics can drink themselves to the point of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which causes dementia-like symptoms. Memory loss can be permanent, and psychosis may occur for several days or several months.   Although the specifics may vary, it is clear that drugs can have lasting and dangerous effects on brain health.          https://www.thefix.com/how-addiction-hijacks-your-brain
Wrenching my brain back from addiction was my biggest challenge.I know I am not alone in this.When I started to purposefully replace smokey thoughts with thoughts of beauty, my healing accelerated.    I would physically look, listen, touch or taste something of beauty to give my brain an alternative that also provided endorphins and triggered my reward response.     I still use this technique if troubled in any way and it helps me stop the tape loop in my head.    
    Very informative post. Very good advice too Sazerac

But I got this.

Damn!  Just did the math and the lowball number came out to 27,500 cigarettes not smoked(the actual number would be slightly higher than that).     Kill them.  Kill them with fire!
Quitting Smoking: Closer with Every Attempt Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States, accounting for 480,000 premature deaths per year.1 The havoc cigarettes wreak on the body has been widely known for many years now among health professionals and the public, yet according to the latest data from the National Health Information Survey, 34.3 million U.S. adults still smoked cigarettes in 2017.2   What keeps people smoking even when they know cigarettes are harmful to their health? Nicotine. Nicotine, the highly addictive drug present in tobacco products, is the main reason that people continue to use tobacco even when they want to quit.3 According to a 2015 survey, about 70 percent of current adult smokers in the United States wanted to quit, and although about 55 percent had attempted to do so in the past year, only 7 percent were successful in quitting for 6-12 months.4    If you are in the majority of adult smokers who have made an unsuccessful quit attempt in the last year, do not give up. Try again. Cigarettes are designed to deliver nicotine quickly to the brain, and because your brain is addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes, they are difficult to quit, both physically and mentally. Although addiction makes quitting especially hard, remember it can be done.   Quitting Smoking: Closer with Each Attempt  When you first quit smoking, your body goes through withdrawal, or the physical manifestation of nicotine leaving your system.  Withdrawal symptoms may include: temporary depression; disrupted sleep patterns; irritability; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; increased appetite.5 The first few days are the most uncomfortable, and physical symptoms of withdrawal should only last about three weeks. However, many smokers find that certain places, occasions, and behaviors—such as drinking coffee going out with friends, or particularly stressful events—can bring up an urge to smoke even after withdrawal symptoms have ended.6 While it may take longer to break these patterns, it is possible to live a completely smoke-free life.    Cigarettes’ addictive nature, the discomfort of withdrawal, and environmental factors associated with the act of smoking all play a role in making quitting a difficult and daunting task.  But quitting is possible.  It takes many smokers multiple tries to permanently quit smoking, but each quit attempt is not in vain, but rather, can be thought of as practice for quitting for good.  With every attempt, you learn more about yourself and your addiction,7 including what techniques work for you to help you stave off cravings.  Each of these practice tries gets you that much closer to quitting cigarettes forever.  Nicotine Replacement Therapy    If you have struggled with quitting in the past and are ready to try again, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may help. NRT can help get addicted smokers through the toughest part of quitting, by relieving cravings, lessening withdrawal symptoms, and helping to reduce stress. When you use FDA-approved NRTs, you gradually withdraw from smoking by receiving measured amounts of nicotine without the toxic chemicals from cigarette smoke. When used properly, NRTs are safe and effective cessation methods and can double a smoker’s chances of quitting cigarettes successfully.8 NRTs are available both by prescription and over-the-counter for adults age 18 and over, and include:   Skin patches that deliver nicotine through the skin.    Nicotine gum that releases nicotine as you chew it. Nicotine lozenges that dissolve in your mouth.  Although NRTs are intended to be used temporarily with the nicotine amounts decreased over time, and eventually removed completely, FDA and doctors recognize that some addicted smokers may need NRTs for longer lengths of time to avoid smoking. If you have unsuccessfully attempted to quit smoking with NRTs, you may want to revisit this option. Many smokers need to experiment with different NRT options before finding one that works for their individual needs. NRTs are considered safe enough that multiple methods9—for instance the patch and the gum—can be used at the same time, and you may start using NRT prior to quitting cigarettes.10  This tactic may alleviate some withdrawal symptoms, as your brain will still receive nicotine during your transition from cigarettes to NRTs. Telephone quit line counseling (PDF) is another effective strategy, and combining counseling with NRTs can be more successful for quitting smoking than nicotine replacement therapy alone.11  How Tobacco Regulation Plays a Role in Helping You Quit FDA understands that quitting is a difficult process, and that NRTs may not work for everyone. The agency’s Nicotine Steering Committee is tasked with researching potential new harm reduction and cessation methods for addicted smokers.  Additionally, in July 2017, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., announced the agency’s intention to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to minimally addictive or nonaddictive levels. While this action would not remove cigarettes from the market, taking the addictive property out of cigarettes would provide addicted adult smokers with a chance to attempt to quit with the help of NRTs, or to switch to other potentially less harmful tobacco products, like e-cigarettes. While more research is needed to understand the potential health risks and benefits of e-cigarettes at both the individual and population level, a 2018 report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine found that completely switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes may offer addicted adult smokers a significant harm-reduction opportunity.    Each Quit Attempt is a Step Forward As 2019 approaches, if you are among the 34 million U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes in this country,12 and your New Year’s Resolution is to quit smoking, either for the first time or to make another attempt, do not give up, and know that you are not alone. Many smokers do not quit on their first attempt and need several tries before they succeed.. Even small successes are wins.  For instance, you may find that the next time you try to quit, you are able to go longer without a cigarette than the last time; or you might discover exercise helps to stave off your cravings. Each time you make a quit attempt, you learn new techniques to implement and move one step closer to being able to call yourself a “former smoker.”         https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/PublicHealthEducation/HealthInformation/ucm628369.htm?utm_source=CTPTwitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ctp-healthobservance
    This post is great Whispers x
This is a post that Joel used to use quite often at the Freedom From Nicotine Message Board before they implemented their no relapse policy.  While it's no longer used at Freedom, it's a very insightful and an excellent message for all of us, especially those who have relapsed and most importantly, mirrors our ideology concerning relapse.  A special thanks to Joel for allowing us to use this. I tried freedom once, why bother trying again? Some past participants have shown a certain reluctance to return to Freedom after relapsing back to smoking.  Many are embarrassed to come back admitting failure.  Others feel they tried Freedom once, and, since they went back to smoking, its techniques must not have worked for them, so why bother trying the same approach again?  Still others feel it is an inconvenience and an unnecessary commitment of time and effort considering they "heard it all before." The concept of returning after a relapse may seem embarrassing at first, but, the ex-smoker will probably see quickly he is not alone.  Many people have had past quits prior to joining Freedom and understand the fragility of a quit. They will generally understand and accept the presence of repeaters enthusiastically.  Relapsers offer a strong confirmation of the concept of addiction to our old members and to all new participants.  They often openly share their past experience of how, after initially quitting, they came to a point of complacency which allowed the relapse to occur.  They generally reflect back at their non-smoking period as a time where they felt emotionally and physically better, and then openly express the disgust and misery that the relapse brought on.  Not only did it cause embarrassment, physical discomfort, and maybe even serious health complications, but also, it was putting them through quitting all over again.  Their insights offer a valuable lesson to first time participants not to make the one tragic mistake that could lead them back to smoking and the need for quitting over again--taking a puff on a cigarette. As far as it being an inconvenience, while reading and posting may take a chunk of time out of a smokers life the first few days, in all probability, there is nothing a smoker has to do the week that he or she is stopping that is as important as quitting smoking.  Failure to touch base daily with us because of conflicts of time with social or even professional commitments makes about as much sense as a cancer patient skipping life saving chemotherapy treatments for the same events.  Missing an entire day because of prior time commitments may jeopardize the quitting process or the long-term maintenance of smoking cessation.  This may cost the person his or her life.  In the long run, it will probably be viewed as an error in judgment by the patient as well as any significant others who recognize what was put at risk and what was lost in the process. For those who feel that Freedom didn't work, the fact is that the techniques taught here didn't fail, the smoker's implementation did.  Only one recurrent theme runs through Freedom: if you don't wish to go back to smoking--NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!  No one ever went back to smoking without disregarding that rule.  Relapsing is an automatic admission that the smoker disregarded the basic principal taught at Freedom. As far as feeling that "I've heard it all before," being a relapser is evidence enough that the smoker did not hear it or comprehend it all before, or is the type of person who needs to hear it over and over again in order to keep believing it.  Repeaters are people who have trouble initially accepting or keeping the concept of addiction alive.  This trait is in all probability the reason why the ex-smoker originally relapsed, or maybe didn't stop at all the first time.  He or she reached a point of complacency where it was believed that smoking could be controlled at an acceptable level.  Smoking is an all or nothing proposition.  The repeater must recognize the reason for the past failure and learn from the experience.  Otherwise, he or she will be doomed to repeat it over and over again. If you have gone back to smoking, come in and try again.  Once you quit smoking, do everything in your power to stay off.  Come in for continued reinforcement and witness the mistakes of other past participants who got complacent.  As far as addiction goes, it is much better to learn from others' mistakes than having to attend later due to your own.  You just don't know whether you will ever have the strength, desire, or opportunity to quit the next time.  In today's society, failing to stay off smoking carries long-term risks which include loss of social status, and respect of others; financial implications which range from supporting an addiction costing hundreds to thousands of dollars per year as well as possibly costing your job and career; and, most significantly, eventual loss of health, and possibly loss of life.  Considering all of this, the choice to quit smoking and to stay off is an important one.  To keep the ability to stay off smoking you need to always remember to NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF! © Joel Spitzer, 2000

    Well, I had a dream that a coworker and I were hanging out in a bar in a casino smoking. I woke up with that familiar guilty feeling only to realize it was a dream and all is well.        It's so strange that -after being quit for over two years and having no desire to smoke- I still have the occasional smoking dream. What a crazy addiction.
    I too have this happen every so often, I feel so guilty when I wake up then come to see it is only a dream -- in a way it seems to strengthen my quit--- as you say "crazy"!!!!!
    Your thread title scared me, Jim, but I knew you weren't going to light back up.        I still have the occasional smoking dream as well..
Cleary, dreaming is hazardous to your health Edited March 11 by Wayne045
    Glad that was just a dream..was worried there....
Jim,    You're click bait headline is misleading and aggravating.   Glad it was just a dream.Edited March 13 by Sazerac
1. Get 20 popsicle sticks   2. Write a reason to quit on each stick 3.Take an empty cigarette pack ~ and fill it with the popsicle sticks.  Every time you feel like lighting up, pull out a reason to quit instead
    LOVE this, great idea whispers 
    That's clever, I love it!
    The day before I quit, I took a bunch of old butts and put them in a clean mayonnaise jar and set it on my desk. Whenever I got a craving, I'd unscrew the lid and take a big whiff.        I only needed to do that a few times.        
    Great idea Whispers!!!
    I love this idea Whispers 
No Smoking Day was first celebrated on Ash Wednesday 1984 in the United Kingdom. Designed as a day to educate and encourage smokers to quit from its humble beginnings it is now celebrated around the world in many countries. Today (yep its already the 13th down under) is about encouraging those who still smoke to break free of the chains of tobacco and nicotine addiction.       Time has shown us just how terrible smoking is. Even if you don't care that your stink, you don't care if your teeth rot or your gums retract, the health dangers can not be denied. The toxins in a cigarette can cause many different forms of cancer from the mouth to the lungs. It can destroy your heart, your lungs, your circulatory system affecting your feet. What is also important to know is that while it may be a personal choice to smoke or not, when one smokes near another person -or even a pet – the second-hand smoke is just as dangerous to them. So, in fact, it really isn’t just a personal decision. The protection of people who do not want to be effected by second-hand smoke has led to new laws in most communities that ban smoking in most public spaces.     But we have all quit you say, how do we celebrate No Smoking Day... its simple, reflect on everything you have gained since you quit. Remember the journey you have taken to get back your freedom. Remember the one or two thing that really helped you keep your quit when you were still doing the hard slog. Remember all these things, reflect on them and then share them.        If you are still a smoker, and lurking out there waiting to jump aboard the QuitTrain make today the day you quit. We know at least one person out there who is quitting today. Contact a quit councilor, look at the options available to aid your quit, not everyone needs them but some of us do. But even if you aren't ready to take the plunge, take the time to do 3 things to move towards your quit, watch a video, read an article, ask a question, learn one new thing. If you have health insurance, see if you plan includes support to quit smoking. Just do something.
    These are what helped me through....     
    I just wrote this on DizzyD's introductory thread   I kept yelling, 'FREE YOUR HEAD!"   I took screaming hot showers.   I drank water.  I ate all the Satsumas in town. Finally, I was able to replace a smokey thought with something of beauty, a sensory delight.    'that light on that leaf' or 'the taste explosion of that Satsuma',  I would listen intently to that piece of music or, luxuriate in that warm embryonic wind...    This technique helped me the most. ﻿
    You can do it ....all you need is the will to win....the determination.... You can rid yourself of this  killer addiction for good....  Quitting with friends is so much more easier and fun too.....trust me !!!.....
Hey, March 13th is also my birthday! I'm honored to share it with No Smoking Day.       I wrote the following on another post last night, but it just about sums up my quit and all that I've learned so far in the process...      I've always been a "stress smoker." Time after time I used stress as an excuse to light up again, even after I had quit for a long time. But what I've finally learned about smoking and it's relationship to stress is this:       Smoking doesn't help. Not even a little bit.        Smoking ADDS to my stress by compounding my current health issues and putting me in danger of new (and worse) ones.     Smoking adds stress by costing me money I don't have, so I can't afford the basic necessities.      Smoking adds stress by making me cough every time I laugh.      Smoking adds stress by putting me into a constant state of nicotine withdrawal.     Smoking adds stress by causing me to have to hide my disgusting habit from others.      Smoking adds stress by forcing me to face my mortality with each and every puff.        You see, I finally figured out that I am more afraid of dying than I am of living.      I just want to live the best life I can, one day at a time. And smoking just doesn't fit into that equation.        Happy smoke-free birthday to me!
    Jo that's a great post. If you are reading and thinking of quitting you will find a ton of support here.        Happy Birthday Abby.  You already gave yourself the best gift by quitting  Hope you have a great day.

I get sad whenever I read about someone that relapses after rocking an awesome quit for weeks or months. I quit smoking 290 days ago and I'm extremely confident I'll never smoke again. Things were a little different on day 142 though. That's the day I almost smoked a cigarette.....      Quote       Day 142.        I have been romanticizing the cigarette for about a week now. I've been daydreaming about the simple joy of holding a cigarette between my fingers, the wonderful tobacco smell of a freshly opened pack, and the feeling of euphoria when taking that first drag. Mmmm....just thinking about it makes my pulse quicken in glorious anticipation.      W. T. F.            This is day 142! I'm "this close" to 5 months.  6 months (HALF A YEAR!) is within spitting distance. How the hell could I let myself get so damn complacent that I'm having thoughts like this? For the most part, my quit has been on auto-pilot for the last couple of months. I stopped actively "quitting" a long time ago. I didn't feel the need, or desire, to spend hours a day reading/posting about nicotine addiction like I did the first several weeks of my quit.         I've lost my motivation and I'm tired of fighting. THAT right there scares the crap out of me. I do NOT want to be a smoker again. I will NOT be a smoker again. I REFUSE to be a smoker again. It is time to fix this thing and get my head back in this quit.         During the early days of a new quit everything is so exciting. You are doing a Good Thing and it's AWESOME! YOU are AWESOME! Loved ones shower you with praise! Strangers on the internet tell you how wonderful you are! You can suddenly smell and taste All The Things! People at work give you high fives and fist bumps! There are parades in your honor! The mayor gives you the key to the city! TMZ hounds you for an interview! Life is FREAKING AMAZING!!!        And then, a few weeks or months later…..things change. Family and friends begin treating you the way they did before you quit. No more high fives. No more fist bumps. No one asks about your quit anymore. Even the paparazzi stop following you around. This “thing” (your quit) isn't fun anymore. Yeah, it’s gotten a lot easier to not smoke but you still sometimes get cravings from hell and you are SO TIRED of fighting. So tired. You feel lonely. You start to hear whispers in your head. It's a voice you thought you silenced a while ago. “Why don’t you just smoke one? It will taste and feel so good. You know you can quit anytime you want.” (My Inner Junkie has a seductive bedroom voice like Barry White and looks like a more sinister version of Wile E. Coyote. Stop judging me!)       Relapse was a very real option for me on day 142 (I'm on day 290 now). I am VERY thankful that I turned things around before it was too late. Some folks don’t. They smoke a cigarette and then a beautiful quit is lost…up in smoke.       I am only posting this to remind everyone, myself included, that we can never let our guards down. I KNOW why I got close to relapse. The reasons are as plain as day to me now:        1.    I stopped educating myself about my addiction.    2.    I greatly decreased the time I spent on this site because I didn't think I needed a support group any longer. 3.    I let a small seed of negative thought (daydreaming of smoking a cigarette) grow until it became a Really Bad Thing.  4.    I fooled myself into thinking I wasn't an addict any more.        What did I do to get my quit back on track?     1.    I re-read all the newbie info here and at whyquit.com 2.    I read Allen Carr’s book. (I read a little bit each day over the course of a couple of months. It was a good daily dose of inspiration.)  3.    I recommitted to spending time on this site reading and helping out where I could.    4.    I admitted to myself that I was always going to be an addict. I can NEVER become complacent again.    5.    I stopped random smoking thoughts IMMEDIATELY whenever I realized what I was thinking about.      Have you come close to relapsing? What did you do to avoid it?      Have you relapsed after a weeks or months long quit? If so, why did it happen and what are you doing now to make sure it doesn't happen again?
    This is a great post from Craig, Jillar.  Thanks for the re-post.   We must never become complacent because addiction doesn't disappear,    it can only be put to sleep and kept asleep. 
    I never get complacent..... Folks have smoked ,when they have a long quit too....we just always be on our guard....
    Bump
    Jillar, Thanks for posting this.        People start their quit full of enthusiasm, excitement, and/or terror.      As with all things wherein we clock the hours it can become a grind.        .  
I remember having some curiosity about whether I would stay quit.More out of interest, really, rather than any real doubt.   For certain,  I did not relish repeating Hell week.  That will never happen again.  Ever.   I gained confidence at one week, two weeks and a big boost at one month, then two.At Three Months I was fully realizing that I would never smoke again.I might still have some struggles but, the die was cast.     When did you have confidence in your quit ?         Edited September 10, 2018 by Sazerac

I went back and looked up an old post of mine, I wrote it about three-weeks in.  The realization that the quit was completely in my control finally started to sink in.  There was no need to look around every corner for nicotine monsters and cigarette boogymen.  They don't exist.  You either smoke or you don't.  I also stopped creating hypothetical scenarios and wondering if I could refrain from smoking.  What if this happens...What if that happens?  No external factors have any bearing on whether you smoke or not.  If you are having the best day of your life, a cigarette will not enhance the experience.  If you are having the worst day of your life, a cigarette will not alleviate your problems.  The cigarette offers nothing positive. The day I recognized my addiction as my own creation that has as much or as little power as I give it and stripped the process down to bare essentials, it all started to make sense.  As soon as I stopped complicating quitting, it became simple.
From day one...I knew there was no going back..I started to feel proud of my quit very early on...going from struggling to walk..without pain..To loving the new me..I could walk,dance..cycle..swim etc..pain free..There's nothing like a good amputation scare to make you open your eyes...I have a couple of war wounds left...I think God has left me them to remember .never take another puff..
Took me around five months I think. I never knew from day one, thought I was just going through the motions of pervious attempts. Once I got to five I thought this will be my first Christmas, smoke free, and I knew it was going to be smoke free....and it was.
1 year
 A broad question . Everyone is different . Many factors could apply  . Quitting is not linear . "You are right where you are suppose to be , would have to be my response to others who feel they are not being confident soon enough . I did not make comparisons to others. 
My quit was mixed up in other issues.  I'd guess that I was mostly out of the woods by the 4th month.   The physical craves were intense but passed after a few weeks.  It's the mental habit monster that is so tied up with my behaviors and routines that played merry hell with my resolve. I didn't so much as break the habit as slowly bury it in the casual sediments of passing days, weeks, and months.
When I realise that one, means a pack and that I'm probably ill due smoking and soda. I need to stick with it. NOPE. No matter what.No excuses.
  I didn't so much as break the habit as slowly bury it in the casual sediments of passing days, weeks, and months. this is a beautiful visual, Sirius.
Day two. Day one was The Great Unknown, but from the second day it was in the bag.   Easy Peasy
Today, after a bumpy day yesterday I realized that I don't smoke because its what I want. Freedom from the nic demon and freedom to enjoy my life.
Great thinking D...freedom is a wonderful place to be..a slave no more...x
Today, after a bumpy day yesterday I realized that I don't smoke because its what I want. Freedom from the nic demon and freedom to enjoy my life. And that's how it's done.  Congratulations and enjoy your newfound freedom.

Nice post.      After relapsing after a 1 year quit previously, I know to stay vigilant.        i am confident that if I remember I could ruin my quit at any time with “just one”, I am unlikely to lose my quit.
About a month into the quit I really believed that I could make it this time. I agree with Boo that you have to stop complicating the quit. I was in the hospital for 9 days with pneumonia and told them that I did not want a patch. I had been telling myself for so long that if only I couldn't smoke for a few days I could make it. The hospital time gave me that and now it was put up or shut up time. Once I got home I took the half pack that was opened and 2 full packs and dumped them in a bucket of water and tossed ash trays in the trash. After 3 to 4 weeks I realized it wasn't all that hard. Craves and stressful but not what I had imagined. I do believe that I had complicated the simple act of stop smoking as an excuse to continue to smoke even though it was taking a hard toll on me.
From the very first minute after I flicked that last cigarette in the air into a snow bank in the Urgent Care parking lot (I announced "this is it, this is my last cigarette!!) and  got in co-workers truck to be transported to the hospital (I was having a stroke at the time!) and he was not waiting for an ambulance!!      Once I accepted the fact that I was fighting an addiction (oh, so hard for me to admit this!) and that I was an addict, I was determined not to blow my second chance.....I read everything I could about the nicotine addiction. Joining an online support forum cemented the quit! Also, I told everyone I knew that I had quit....I didn't keep it a secret like I did the first two times I quit. My life was on the line now.......and I am sure that my being quit for 14 months when I was told I now needed CABGx3 surgery (a triple bypass!) helped me survive!        I agree with others above...don't complicate the quit.....just do it....one day at a time....you will not regret it!
There was that nervous initial leap on oct 6th 2017, and honestly after three days i thought, "alright, I can do this". But still nerve racked. When the three week battle never arrived, THAT is when true confidence set in.      But yeah that initial leap, oh yeah, the days or hours building up to it suuuuuuck.
    The minute I put out my last cigarette, I knew I would never smoke again.
Honestly, 8 months in I'm still not confident, but I'm doing it. It is getting easier with the passing of time, so one day soon will be the turning point.
Although I was firm in my commitment to myself never to smoke again right from the first, I think it was about 6 to 7 months in before I really knew I had turned the corner on this addiction and that I had faced pretty much every battle it could through at me. From that point forward I was somehow just more confident that I wouldn't waver in my commitment to quitting.
I don't want to sound cocky but I,too, knew the minute I put out my last cigarette.     Then, again, around the 4 month mark, I told jillar that I'd see her on the lido deck
So I kind of knew the day I played a game on the over there where you had to list famous people and I was stuck in a battle with another newbie (I was about 6 weeks in) using the initials AA... 3 things happened that day, 1. I realised I was about to invent famous people with the intials AA to make sure I won, 2. There was no way I was giving up my quit if the other person didn't give up theirs first the annoying pain in my backside, I mean who did they think they were .... LOL they know who they are and that they went on to become a great friend and not a mortal enemy to be beaten in every game.... so the seeds of a great friendship were sewn and.... 3. I think I can do this became a reality. (although until about the 3.5 month it was still, well shit their still here, can't quit today.... yes I am that mental).  [ No wait, because I know you will read this and I know you will know who you are... if you toss your quit I will probably just go ahead and toss mine too so now you can't toss yours because it's two quits you are responsible for .... joke joyce.... I know I am the only one responsible for my quit and I have my grown up hat on now so don't stress, you are officially off the hook]        Then about 5 months I started to realise I felt completely different about this quit than my big one... every little event that happened the last time I had a substantial quit I looked at it and said, hmmm is that a good reason to have a smoke... and I hadn't done that with this quit, not once, not at all.... I wasn't thinking about smoking all the time... mentally this quit was different....         But just after my 6 month anni when I put in my Lido Deck catering order with Reci it kinda became a done deal... doesn't mean I haven't had bad days, or close calls since because we all know I have... but the reality is I don't see myself ever smoking again and unlike last time I don't want to, I LIKE THE FREEDOM.        I know one puff is it for me... that's all it will take... so NOPE NOPE NOPE... there is still a niggle of self doubt,  but I think that will always be there even in 20 years because I know I do stupid shit, and I know i'm only 1 puff away.... so I need to have that little negative voice of doubt to keep me on the straight and narrow.Edited September 12, 2018 by notsmokinjo
    I can still remember the day I watched the Tobacco War Documentaries....( front page if you havnt watched them )... This changed my whole view of smoking....I knew from then on...I hated the whole scenario.....  No way..was these evil money grabbing ( bleep)....going to get another penny of me...I refused to be another number...   
Id say about 6 months in i was clear...  First 5 months were gangsta. At the 1 year mark i was done.

For myself it was over a year when i got drunk and had no urge to smoke, i was afraid of alcohol that it would trigger me wanting to smoke. I had quit in the past which i had mentioned but i was also avoiding certain triggers. After meeting the triggers head on and flat out saying NO which we do our pledge of NOPE on here i felt confident. To you and sslip, at times even now for myself certain things pop up and I just learned not to reach for them. Thats the difference for me, I'll go for a walk or work out and accepted i had that addict brain and you know what ... Having an addict brain is OK. We're all human and are born to make mistakes..  @Sslip
I just wanted to add something for you peeps who are 7 or 8 months or even a year into your quits. I''m a year and a half in now and I can tell you for sure, I feel A LOT more confident now than I did at even a year so ........ if you are still feeling those small occasional moments of uncertainty, it does still get better as you build even more time into your quit.        I just went through a whole pile of life crap in one month and the stress levels were very high for some time yet not once did the thought of having a smoke enter my mind in terms of making things better - not once!! I can't say the same would have been true at even 1 year quit so ........ it does still keep getting better and better the longer you just say NOPE  Edited September 12, 2018 by reciprocity

Some really great responses here.  In my own case, it was probably 11 months or so that I was really convinced that I was non/ex-smoker (as opposed to convincing myself that I was a non/ex-smoker).  That said, while I haven't had a single craving for or even a passing thought of smoking a cigarette for well over fifteen years, I remain (quietly and gently) vigilant.  The addiction scares me and always will.          Christian99 17+ Years QuitEdited March 8 by Christian99
I have good confidence that I will reach the one year mark. Its the straightforward confidence of NOPE.     But. That doesnt mean I am free of the thoughts, the many addict voices, the rotten days, the 'will this ever end-s'. Still there, though not at all what it was.       I am sure that maintaining my quit through some dramatic life events like the death of a loved one and breakup doubled confidence.      I long for happier days and I know that by the time they arive, the excess of addiction has made room for a more grounded me.       Yes, I am confident about quitting and it means the world to me to be able to say that!Edited March 8 by MLMR
Hi everyone,    I was thinking about what I did before I started smoking cigarettes.  I basically know what I did;  I was an average kid who climbed trees, went to school, etc...   But I was trying to remember what I loved, what made me happy before smoking.  I started smoking when I was 11, so I'm having to think pretty far back in the past.   Do you have memories of your life prior to smoking?
I started smoking my freshman year in college at age 18.  I smoked one memorable (and disgusting) cigarette before then.        I ran cross-country in high school and was an avid runner, mediocre but enthusiastic basketball player, and overall fairly physically fit prior to becoming a smoker.       As I started to smoke in college , I found it gradually harder to run for endurance, stay physically active, etc. and I became a lot less athletic as staying physically fit slowly became less of a priority.      Smoking robs people of their quality of life in so many different ways.Edited March 4 by johnny5
I had three brothers to keep up with.  We climbed trees, caught poly wogs in the creek near our home and made forts.  All the kids in the neighborhood played together.  I never saw that kind of togetherness in any neighborhood after my childhood.    I did not start until I was 18.  I had a very strict upbringing and would not dare defy my parents.  My smoking was me busting into adulthood.  I still can feel that moment I coughed through my first cigarette and felt so cool.  I am sure I looked very foolish.
Like many, I started around 17 years old as a result of hanging around a buddy who also started at the same time - it was the cool, grown up thing to do in those days. Before then I was just a regular kid doing regular kid things.      The conversion from non smoker to smoker was seamless. The conversion from smoker back to non smoker ........ not so much
I grew up in Alabama and on occasion during the summers someone would sneak a smoke from their folks and we'd sit around acting cool. But my real smoking started in high school out here in California. I still remember the day I inhaled for the first time and my sister congratulating me!  That led to us putting our lunch money together to buy a pack of cigarettes for 52¢ a pack. When I finally quit, 35 years later, cigs were $5.68 a pack IF you bought them by the carton. Which being the dedicated smoker I was, I did

I regret all the time I wasted and the damage it caused my body but am grateful that I have had the last 2 years to get myself into a good place both physically and mentally since quitting.
    I can remember my life before smoking.      I was more a girly girl so no tree climbing for me. I would be more likely to be brushing my dolls hair or having a tea party for all my teddies.

I started smoking at 11...rebelled... Started hanging out with older kids ..and tried to keep up ...    From a early age I was sent to Ballet school....so most of my days were spent there...I was on blocks at the age of ten...  My life was a strict schedule... Hence the rebellion... My mother was obsessed ...  That rebellion cost me 52 years of my life ...  I would have loved to play in the mud and catch frogs ...
I had a great childhood.    Tadpoles, trees, horses for a spell.    We moved around every year or two and I LOVED that.     I remember at twelve or so, flying by myself somewhere. (we didn't have to be chaperoned back then) The ticket agent asked me,  'smoking or non-smoking'    I said, 'smoking'   because that's where all the hip people were.       I am thinking somewhere from 14-16, I was smoking.  Started hanging out with dealers, poets, musicians and pimps,   I was in such a hurry to be an adult.
    Doreensfree,    I was forced into ballet school, too.  I felt so out of place in ballet class that I used to deliberately hurt myself in attempts to get out of class.  LOL

Really I remember my life pretty well before smoking -- school, sports, running around with friends and going thru the high school life and all that came with that.  I did not start smoking until I went into the Army, smoking was part of the Army life then and it was so cheap to buy cigs.  Even got free cigs then with the c-rations at that time, so sad!!!Edited March 4 by Martian5
Memories...!        Building lots and lots of mysterious lego constructions, reading under the blankets with a flashlight, four years of ice skating(for which I lacked total talent), more reading, also catching tadpoles and watch them grow. I once went cleaning the bowl they were in and dropped it. We found dried mini frogs all year. I spent so much time with my younger sister, we did everything together. From annoying our parents to comforting eachother when they were having another one of their awfull fights.        I stole my first cigaret when I was 13, didnt have a clue how to light it. I almost choked and swore I would never start doing that, even pledged it in my diary. I recall writing something about vomiting and death, happy cheerfull kid that I was. One year later I was occasionaly having smokes with some of the badass neighbour kids and at 15 I spent my paper route money on Luckies. Which became John Player Special, Chesterfield, Gauloises, roll your owns Drum and later on Javaanse jongens 3/4.
I didnt start til I was 27, so childhood had already passed.
Wow, you didn't start till you were 27...that's got such a wholesome ring to it!
I started on/off smoking at 18 (post high school) and daily at 22 in college.  So, like JB, my child years were pretty much behind me       I was an avid cyclist.  Still am but I use my exercise bike more than my real one.  Waiting for warm weather to return.     I also remember having more hair back then.  Can I blame that on smoking too?

(here you go Amy) :)How do you feel about a friend who has to go everywhere with you? Not only does he tag along all the time, but since he is so offensive and vulgar, you become unwelcome when with him. He has a peculiar odor that sticks to you wherever you go. Others think both of you stink.He controls you totally. When he says jump, you jump. Sometimes in the middle of a blizzard or storm, he wants you to come to the store and pick him up. You would give your spouse hell if he or she did that to you all the time, but you can't argue with your friend. Sometimes, when you are out at a movie or play he says he wants you to go stand in the lobby with him and miss important scenes. Since he calls all the shots in your life, you go.Your friend doesn't like your choice of clothing either. Instead of politely telling you that you have lousy taste, he burns little holes in these items so you will want to throw them out. Sometimes, he tires of the furniture and gets rid of it too. Occasionally, he gets really nasty and decides the whole house must go.He gets pretty expensive to support. Not only is his knack of property destruction costly, but you must pay to keep him with you. In fact, he will cost you thousands of dollars over your lifetime. And you can count on one thing, he will never pay you a penny in return.Often at picnics you watch others playing vigorous activities and having lots of fun doing them. But your friend won't let you. He doesn't believe in physical activity. In his opinion, you are too old to have that kind of fun. So he kind of sits on your chest and makes it difficult for you to breathe. Now you don't want to go off and play with other people when you can't breathe, do you?Your friend does not believe in being healthy. He is really repulsed by the thought of you living a long and productive life. So, every chance he gets he makes you sick. He helps you catch colds and flu. Not just by running out in the middle of the lousy weather to pick him up at the store. He is more creative than that. He carries thousands of poisons with him which he constantly blows in your face. When you inhale some of them, they wipe out cilia in your lungs which would have helped you prevent these diseases.But colds and flu are just his form of child's play. He especially likes diseases that slowly cripple you - like emphysema. He considers this disease great. Once he gets you to have this, you will give up all your other friends, family, career goals, activities - everything. You will just sit home and caress him, telling him what a great friend he is while you desperately gasp for air.But eventually your friend tires of you. He decides he no longer wishes to have your company. Instead of letting you go your separate ways, he decides to kill you. He has a wonderful arsenal of weapons behind him. In fact, he has been plotting your death since the day you met him. He picked all the top killers in society and did everything in his power to ensure you would get one of them. He overworked your heart and lungs. He clogged up the arteries to your heart, brain, and every other part of your body. In case you were too strong to succumb to this, he constantly exposed you to cancer causing agents. He knew he would get you sooner or later.Well, this is the story of your "friend," your cigarette. No real friend would do all this to you. Cigarettes are the worst possible enemies you ever had. They are expensive, addictive, socially unacceptable, and deadly.

Found this at the back of the cupboard...
Doreen, thank you for this. Just read it to my other half who has quit with me and he asked me to send it to him so he can print out the words and keep them with him. He doesn't use the forums. He doesn't use NRT. He's doing this on willpower alone so I'm really pleased when I can help him in anyway. You should be too!  You're all cracking out the inspirational posts today!  Thank you for taking the time. X

Not only does he tag along all the time, but since he is so offensive and vulgar, you become unwelcome when with him. He has a peculiar odor that sticks to you wherever you go. Others think both of you stink.            He controls you totally. When he says jump, you jump. Sometimes in the middle of a blizzard or storm, he wants you to come to the store and pick him up. You would give your spouse hell if he or she did that to you all the time, but you can't argue with your friend. Sometimes, when you are out at a movie or play he says he wants you to go stand in the lobby with him and miss important scenes. Since he calls all the shots in your life, you go.           Your friend doesn't like your choice of clothing either. Instead of politely telling you that you have lousy taste, he burns little holes in these items so you will want to throw them out. Sometimes, he tires of the furniture and gets rid of it too. Occasionally, he gets really nasty and decides the whole house must go.           He gets pretty expensive to support. Not only is his knack of property destruction costly, but you must pay to keep him with you. In fact, he will cost you thousands of dollars over your lifetime. And you can count on one thing, he will never pay you a penny in return.           Often at picnics you watch others playing vigorous activities and having lots of fun doing them. But your friend won't let you. He doesn't believe in physical activity. In his opinion, you are too old to have that kind of fun. So he kind of sits on your chest and makes it difficult for you to breathe. Now you don't want to go off and play with other people when you can't breathe, do you?          Your friend does not believe in being healthy. He is really repulsed by the thought of you living a long and productive life. So, every chance he gets he makes you sick. He helps you catch colds and flu. Not just by running out in the middle of the lousy weather to pick him up at the store. He is more creative than that. He carries thousands of poisons with him which he constantly blows in your face. When you inhale some of them, they wipe out cilia in your lungs which would have helped you prevent these diseases.         But colds and flu are just his form of child's play. He especially likes diseases that slowly cripple you - like emphysema. He considers this disease great. Once he gets you to have this, you will give up all your other friends, family, career goals, activities - everything. You will just sit home and caress him, telling him what a great friend he is while you desperately gasp for air.            But eventually your friend tires of you. He decides he no longer wishes to have your company. Instead of letting you go your separate ways, he decides to kill you. He has a wonderful arsenal of weapons behind him. In fact, he has been plotting your death since the day you met him. He picked all the top killers in society and did everything in his power to ensure you would get one of them. He overworked your heart and lungs. He clogged up the arteries to your heart, brain, and every other part of your body. In case you were too strong to succumb to this, he constantly exposed you to cancer causing agents. He knew he would get you sooner or later.           Well, this is the story of your "friend," your cigarette. No real friend would do all this to you. Cigarettes are the worst possible enemies you ever had. They are expensive, addictive, socially unacceptable, and deadly. Consider all this and - NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!                   Joel© Joel Spitzer 1990
    Damn Girl !  AAA ok I see you did not write this let me rephrase   Damn Joel !   I am not sure I would have ever associated smoking as a friend, more of a need   But if one was to embody smoking I think Joel has captured it (he or she) a relationship you wish had never started.  Think I'll print thi and take it with me tomorrow,      Thank you Julie for sharing it with us
Thanks for the bump Sazerak. This essay was always one of my favorites/most helpful, it really made me think about what I was doing with my smoking. I had it bookmarked for ready reading for my first 6 months.....
    One of the few essays that truly get to me.
    This has to be one of my favourite posts..I never tire reading it...    My friend my reward...geez....

Consider all this and - NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!                   Joel© Joel Spitzer 1990         Bump for @Lilly and all of us, really.  We were all such obedient slaves.
    Things are getting Better and Better, like this week end Family over fun, food,  alot of conversation, and not one thouight about smoking.  Death makes me want to smoke,  when I found my younger Brother dead is when I lasped .  Now My BHB Best Hunting Buddy Joe out of the Blue dies ?  and yes I wanted to smoke.  I did learn from my episode with my Brother althought it helped sooth my nerves and emotions it was very temporary and it put me right back on that smoking for no reason except to feed my addition. So with Joe I looked deper into myself to cope with not having him around anymore. I still need to take time to Grieve, I don't know,  what is grieve ? I will miss him,  I will have moments that his absence may overwhelm me at a moment.  But I will also have him in the Mountains, in the early morning fog, beside the camp fire.   So I am not sure if Grieve is correct.   Lets just say  I need to take time to say good bye, Love you and will miss you.  I will be assisting his wife in getting herself organized and the whole clearing of stuff.,    Sho and Joe both smoked  and I know I will need to be extra dilligent and stead fast when over there house helping.  I have made some preperations, I am bringing my son in law and my daughter both non smokers and both strong supporters of me not smoking.   so if I need a pep talk, hug or reinforment it is there.   You know back around Christmas I was writing about how good things were going and all seemed so bright and wonderful the future was looking and then one morning I woke up and was sucker punched right between the eyes, losing my Job, Bill my brother in law, Joe my Best hunting bud, it is amazing how fast life can turn on you.   Not much I can do about it except work my way through it,  Pull my man pants up and get to moving things back in to the sunlight.  Deep breathes, a tear hear and there when a moment floods in memory of Bill or Joe and new aventures ahead.   Looking at the difference between when My Brother passed and now I am so much more stable,  my thoughts are clearer,  my reasoning sharper, my strength and self assteem provide me the foundation to put into prospective and pritoritize what needs to be done, how to do it and when to stop and breath, close my eyes, to cleanse some of the emotional clutter.   I feel much better, the Vent has done what a vent should do.   Deep breath and  get ready for the final interview tomorrow.
    Aw man opah, sorry for the loss of your brother in law and  friend 
dear Opah, you are having a horrible time lately,  I am so sorry.   Don't make it all worse by smoking. Remember Cristóbal's WisdomYour Quit & Your Life        There are a lot of 'grief' sites out there  maybe one can help youTop 50 Web Sites and Forums For Grief Counseling
    I'm sorry for your losses Opah. It might not feel like it now but it gets better and easier... and smoking wont make that happen, only time will. I lost a friend and a family member within days of each other early in my quit and it was a close call at times but smoking wasn't going to help me heal and I am so glad I realised that. I think you know that too. I also lost my job as the business I had worked for closed down, being able to tell prospective employers I was a non-smoker certainly lifted my spirits.   Good luck with the interview.
    This post is so sad. I felt like it was just you and me when I read that.       So sorry for what you are going through - and have been through.        Rooting for you with your interview X x      
    Aww O....this is sad reading ...I'm sorry for your losses.....  Stay strong....and sending you a cyber hug x
I have desided to call it a day here at work, the DC is so quite, machines are still and I am having such a hard time setting here. Need to be "all that" tomorrow morning for this interview.   if all works out A job will not be one of the things i need to worry about, then  I can deal with the Loss of my Friends and family.   They say Death comes in 3s ?  if that is true I am done with it for the now,  Marky my younger brother, Bill  my brother in law and Joe makes 3.    Back to Deep breathes, and focus one the Immidiate   "The Interview"     God I miss being Young the Good old Days
So here I am Wednesday midle of the week and just read an Email stating thats it, we are dne, no possiblility or Hope of staying open.  you have 29 days of work and then Austa yo whaivos, arrivadurchy, any other way we need to say good bye.    29 days, I have spent the last 30 days selling my self on the internet, I have song my praise over the phone and pandered in person.    and a job is still not a positive.   I have had hard times in the Past and here I am  in all my glory, ready to take on this new challenge, I my younger I would Boast when your good your good, BUT when your better than good your Me and could pretty much prove it any day of the week.  So now Opah its time to prove it to your self,  are you as good as you once was ?       Nothing Better for the soul then a huge smile and a Cyber hug !Edited March 6 by Opah
    Hang in there Opah. Things have a way of working out    regardless of how much we worry or fret.    Protect your quit and be kind to yourself.  Reward yourself, you still need to be diligent in re-wiring your brain receptors.   So, take a nice walk. Do something that you really, really will enjoy.
0...as one door shuts ..another one opens ...its not over till the fat lady sings ...   Sending you that Smile and a Hug ....go pamper yourself on something good....your worth it .!!!!
    Big (((hug))) from me x
    WHOOO HOOOO,  Ive been Hugged
    Opah, we all hate those times in life that we have lost all control.  As difficult as those periods were hard to go through, they always make you grow and were changes that were meant to be.  I think you have a wonderful attitude and it will carry you through this.   You have a hug from me too.  Hang in there.
So sorry for your loses Opah. These last 3 out of four months have been a bit trying here as well. But the strange thing is every time I thought about a smoke for a second it vanished as quick as it came. I didn't even consider lighting up. It has been 4 months and I feel totally different than I have in 40 years. I don't feel like I have to have the damn things every time something bad happens and it sounds like you are almost there yourself. Don't give in now because you're there! I saw first hand what it looks like to go through the pain of needing the Nicobitch and I didn't realize I was once that way. It saddened me see her go through the desperation of needing that first smoke of the day and not able to have it, it had been14 hours, being around our grandkids. I actually hurt for her so bad that I told her to please consider and try to think about putting them down. Done rambling but Great job Opah, and keep on keepin on!
    Wantsit:    Your Rambles are my insperation, Thank you 
    I know you have a lot going on, Opah,   none of which will change for the better if you smoke.  Smoking will only bring you down.       At two months, your quit is young and tender.   Please, protect it and be extra kind to yourself.   These are crucial months of your successful quit.   Be aware of triggers and stay vigilant.     You are winning.  You Don't Smoke.
    You guys inspire me on a daily basis,  I realy am a Blessed man.  How antone could quit without a premire support group on their side is beyound me.   I hope there is someone out there peeking in on us, wondering if they could quit and see what a beautiful avenue this is to take.  in fact,         I know  i play this quit often but it really cheers me up and reminds me of us.   
I'm in another quitt group and quite a few do this and some reward themselves with a cruise on that lido deck for the 1 year anny
    I first kept seven to ten bucks a day between the pages of a book   which quickly became unweidly so, I switched to a big mason jar and watched my wealth like Midas.   Money or,  the accumulation thereof, was a huge motivation for me.       
Yup, when u see it. One guy put a picture of  a boat he always wanted with $ he saved . My ticker im at 12,000, put that cash in a jar
The recovered alcoholic, the heroin addict, the nicotine addict, deep down each knows the "Law of Addiction."  They've heard it over and over again.  Just one sip, one tiny fix, or one little puff of nicotine, just once, that's all it takes and the addict is back!  They know that either immediately or in a short period of time they'll once again be slaves to their old level of drug use or greater.  We know the Law of Addiction so why do we break it? There are three primary factors associated with relapse: (1) rewriting the law of addiction; (2) an excuse; and (3) a vague memory.  It doesn't matter if it happens within two hours, two days, two weeks, two months, two years, or twenty, the factors remain the same and apply to all of us.  Rewriting the law of addiction is easy and you don't need a pencil, paper or computer to do it. Amending the Law of Addition"Just one puff" and then "do not pass go, do not collect $200, but go directly to the addict's prison and surrender your freedom for good."  It isn't that the recovering nicotine addict doesn't know or believe the law of addiction because we do.  It's just that we begin to believe that we're the exception.  We convince ourselves that we're stronger and smarter than those who discovered the law, and wiser than all addicts who came before us.  We amend the law.  We put ourselves above it.  "Just one, it'll be ok, I can handle it, I'm stronger than the others, a little reward, it's been a while, I've earned it." I'm sorry.  As soon as such thoughts begin infecting the mind they tend to start feeding on themselves and in all likelihood your body's period of healing and freedom is over.  Your dreams and hard work are all being thrown into a dirty toilet that one puff of nicotine is about to flush. Instead of saying that you can handle "just one," a truthful statement would have been "I can handle them all, give them all back to me, my entire addiction, all the ashtrays, the coughs, the stink, the endless stream of 4,000 plus deadly chemicals that come with each puff (including up to 81 known cancer causing agents), the constant gradual destruction of every cell in my lungs and the gradual clogging and hardening of every blood vessel in my body, the 50/50 chance of killing myself 13-14 years early, all the money it will cost me to stay enslaved for years and years to come (together with massive future price increases designed to get me to quit), the growing social pressures that will make me feel even more like an outcast, I want it all back, all of it!" It's far easier for the junkie mind to create a one puff or one cigarette exception to the law" than admit the truth.  A one pack a day addiction is 7,300 cigarettes a year.  Don't picture smoking just one.  Instead, picture yourself sticking at least a year's supply into your mouth all at once. Try fitting them all into your mouth because in truth that's exactly where they'll be going, year after year after year.  "To thine own self be true."   You deserve the truth - you paid the price - you earned it. The Perfect ExcuseThe excuse can be anything.  Usually the addict waits for that great excuse to come along, but some get tired of waiting and any old excuse will do.  Even joy!  A reunion with an old smoking buddy, a few drinks with friends, a wedding, a graduation, or even a baby's birth and a free nicotine laden cigar, or trying a harmless looking new nicotine delivery device like the 27 flavors of suckers, the straw, lozenges, candy or even nicotine water or soda, why not!  But joyful or even stupid nicotine relapse is harder to explain to yourself and those you love. The smart nicotine addict waits for the great excuse, the one that we know we can sell to ourselves and others.  As sick as it may sound, the easiest to sell and the best of all is the death of a loved one.  Although everyone we love is destined to die and it'll happen sooner or later, for the reformed addict it's the perfect excuse for relapse.  I mean, who can blame us for ingesting highly addictive drugs into our bodies upon our mother's death.  Anyone who does would have to be extremely insensitive or totally heartless!  Right?  Losing a job, the end of a relationship, serious illness, disease or financial problems are all great excuses too - it's drug time again!  The addict is back! Lost MemoriesBut an excuse doesn't work alone.  It needs help.  Failing memories of "why" we were willing to put ourselves through the anxieties and emotion of physical withdrawal, and weeks and weeks of psychological adjustment in order to break free, breathe fatal life into any excuse.  Most of us failed to keep a detailed record of why we commenced recovery or what it was like.  Instead, we are forced to rely upon our memory to accurately and vividly preserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  But now, the memory in which we placed all our trust has failed us. It isn't that your memory is bad, faulty or doing anything wrong.  In fact, it's working as it should to preserve in as much detail as possible the joyful events of life, while forgetting, as quickly as possible, all the pain and anguish that we've felt, including our disdain for the addict's life we lived.  To have our brains do otherwise would make life inside our minds unbearable.  If women were forced to remember the true agony and intense pain of childbirth, most would have just one.  We are each blessed with the gift to forget. So how does the reformed nicotine addict who failed to keep accurate records of their journey revive their passion for freedom and recall liberty's price?  If we forget the past, are we destined to repeat it?  Not necessarily.  It doesn't have to be.  But just as any loving relationship needs nourishment to flourish, we can never take our recovery for granted or the flame will eventually die and the fire will go out.  We have to want to protect this glory until the day we die.  We have to turn that "want" into action.  If we do, we win.  If not, our fate may be up in the air with serious risk of relapse followed by crippling disease or even a very early grave. Whether it's daily, weekly or monthly, our recovery needs care.  If you don't have a detailed log to regularly review when faced with adversity, upon each anniversary of your quit, or at each birthday, do your best to create one now.  Talk to those still smoking and ask for help in revitalizing your memories.  Encourage them to be as truthful as possible.  Although they may look like they're enjoying their addiction to smoking nicotine, the primary joy they get is in keeping their body's blood serum nicotine level within the comfort zone, so as to avoid the onset of the anxieties and craves of early withdrawal.  Show them your pen and paper and invite them to help you create your list.  You may even cause a spark in them.  Be kind and sincere.  It wasn't long ago that those were our shoes. Also, try envisioning the first week. What was it like?  Can you still feel the powerful craves as your body begged and cried to be fed?  Can you still feel the pain?  Do you see yourself not being able to concentrate, having difficulty sleeping, feeling depressed, angry, irritable, frustrated, restless, with tremendous anxiety, a foggy mind, sweating palms, rapidly cycling emotions, irrational thinking, emotional outbursts or even the shakes?  Do you remember these things?  Do you remember the price you paid for freedom?  Do you remember why you were willing to pay it? If you have access to a computer, you won't need a smoker's help or even to recall the early days of your own journey.  You can go on-line to scores of smoking cessation support groups and find thousands of battles being fought, hear tons of cries and watch hundreds struggling for survival as they cling to the promise of the rich sense of inner calmness, quiet and comfort that lies beyond.  Visit as often as possible.  Make a few posts to those in need.  The most important thing you can tell them is the truth about why you are there.  Tell them how comfortable and complacent you've become.  It's what they yearn to hear!  Many smoked their entire adult life and have a difficult time believing that withdrawal isn't permanent.  Fear of the unknown is frightening.  Help them and in doing so help yourself. If you find yourself attempting to rewrite the law of addiction, stop, think, remember, read, revisit, revive and give to others, but most important, be honest with you.  Terrible and emotional events will happen in each of our lives - such is life.  Adding full-blown nicotine relapse to any situation won't fix, correct or undo your underlying concern.  In your mind, plan for disaster today.  How will you cope and keep your healing alive should the person you love most in this world suddenly die?  What will you do?  Remember, we've only traded places with our chemical dependency and the key to the cell is one puff of nicotine.  As long as we stay on this side of the bars, we are the jailors and our dependency the prisoner. We only have two choices. We can complete this temporary period of adjustment and enjoy comfortable probation for life or we can smoke nicotine, relapse, and intentionally inflict cruel and unusual punishment upon these innocent bodies for the remainder of their life, together with inviting a 50/50 chance that you'll be putting yourself to death. If the first choice sounds better - comfortable lifetime probation - then we each need only follow one simple rule - NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF! Breathe deep, hug hard, live long!John

Aww youre a sweetie. Its amazing how far reaching the addiction is, to call 7 months early (i believe you btw), then this is such a monumental jorney of perseverance its amazing
There will be a point when you stop abstaining and accept that you are done with smoking, it's over.  The struggle you feel will fall from you like a snowflake and you will be free.  Come back and tell us when it happens for you.
God knows i have 7 months on my belt and still feel like smoking it never really goes away does it...? It just decreases i guess... Are you unhappy about this ?  Does it bother you that you still feel like smoking ?
Breathe deep, hug hard, live long!JohnQuote shortened for space, however, this really needs to be at the top of EVERY page.   I wish I could have read this days ago....... even weeks.  
    Protect your quit,  friends.    Protect it with everything you have, everything you are.    Freedom from addiction is a generous reward for any toil or trouble you may experience  and our bodies are amazing healing machines when we give them the opportunity.

    This is a great post, thank you @Sazerac for bumping. I chronicled my journey through my first year and read it every monthaversary to remind myself where I started and how far I'd come. Unfortunately it was lost when our old board went down 
@jillar The loss of your archives is a terrible loss to you, to all of us.      I am so glad you and most of your gang are here creating new ones.
    For the newbies !!!
I am on another forum (nothing to do with smoking or not) but someone brought up how coffins just seemed like a waste of money, too much of a luxury for a corpse.  Anyways I mentioned not wanting to know any details of my own death. I am mid 40's and when I was 38, my mom died. That was kind of something that made me realize that death means business.   When I threw away my last cigarette in Oct 2017, one thing I had recurring thoughts of before I quit was, "What if this really does kill me early than I would like to die?     I mean my breath rattled at night, I could not laugh without coughing, everything stank of smoke, blood pressure was a little high...   I honest to God thought I would be dead by age 60 if I kept smoking. That is a little early. I would like to make it to at least age 75.        I just wonder if it's common for people in their 40's to start having recurring thoughts of death. If so, why would anyone this age or older STILL puff away on those cancer sticks?    Some of these young smokers do not think about death of course but they will someday.       Think about this - most forums lose members because they got banned over something, or maybe they got mad and just left. Forums like this sometimes lose members because their respiratory problems got the best of them. At what age though do smokers say, "Hmm, I would rather live a few more years than smoke this piece of crap cigarette".       Sometimes I still want a cigarette but I am not dieing for one.
    unfortunately....the fear of death and dying would make an addicted smoker...smoke more!  That's what I did...until I was truly ready       When the student is ready....the teacher appears
    I was in deep denial over health issues attributed to smoking   and if I ever thought about them,  I didn't care.   Health was not a factor in my quitting. My freedom was the main impetus.        I don't really have a fear of dying.    I still think I am going to live forever, lol.
     Some people don't value life like we do. They flat out dont care. My mother got a health scare when she couldn't breathe and quit, why wait till we get that scare? Most of us do, i have sinus issues and  i would always buy advil cold and sinus pills to open me back up instead of quitting... Took me years but after i quit i don't need the pills anymore . My good friend quit and it was after we were on the phone and we were laughing and he was choking he quit and went back, when i asked him why he went back he got upset so i stopped. Same goes for drinking, eating healthy. People get defensive and lash back at you when you try to help. When they ask i offer help now and i love that "When the student is ready....the teacher appears". Dead on... I like that one         
    I took the approach that I was dying for the day I was born, I might as well be "happy" while i was here cos I was gunna die anyway. I kid you not my health had nothing to do with quitting. I still can't pin why I quit probably money but more resentment that the smokes were in control not me.
    Cigarettes are just so addictive that even dying people can't stop smoking them.        I used to think people cared more about smoking than themselves and their families when they chose them over life. I even used to say I would rather live two years less and smoke than have the extra two years and be miserable without smoking.      Babs is spot on in that fear keeps smokers smoking more - even when they could die.         I think it was Reci who recently said something that sums this addiction up for me. He said something on the lines of the transition from non smoker to smoker is so easy but smoker to non smoker is not so easy. That's pretty much it in a nutshell.                          
    Smokers only fear that they might succeed in quitting.  It was years before I could tell myself that cigarettes were killing me.  If you are talking to someone about quitting, start by telling them not to be afraid.
    I think that most smokers figure out at some time that cigarettes are in fact compromising their quality of life and in fact may even die due to smoking.  That is when the fear might set in -- fear of no longer having a "lifelong friend" or dying to a enemy that they themselves have created (kind of a fear of their own stupidity).  These are thoughts that do not come up when we begin smoking but at some point this idea slaps us in the face, then we have to face what indeed is comfortable to us -- for me it was quitting!!!!
    '...The memory of her last few months haunts me. She was in so much pain and couldn't breathe. Watching your loved one go through something like this is heartbreaking and if this email stops just one person from taking a puff, then I feel that it's worth it.'  https://whyquit.com/whyquit/Memorial.html      Not only would you die early,  chances are you'd put your loved ones up with awfull memories. Ten times worse than just dying if you ask me.  These stories are actually real.   
Smoking takes all the fear of dying away... Last year I watched my best friend take her last breath hours after her last cigarette..... Thankfully I had the strength to quit ,when I got my health scare...me and my feet have had over 5 years more together..and God willing many more...
    The fact is the addiction always over road what the consequences were going to be.  I feared dying from smoking but also feared not smoking.  It wasn't until some kindhearted, caring people stood beside me and guided me to the other side.  I never thought I was strong enough to do it.  They showed me differently.  For that I will always be grateful and hope that I can help others.
    My perception of death or debilitating disease as a result of smoking was one thing when I was a smoker but is now completely different as a non-smoker.
I remember feeling very mortal early in my quit and actually still to this day. As a smoker I felt invinsible I suppose. Too busy smoking, too much in denial to see what's really happening.   But it was a lung cancer diagnosis that prompted my quit. And that young mum that got diagnosed did die shortly after diagnosis.    Her getting diagnosed just clicked something in me. She wasn't old. She was young. Had a wonderful husband...children. I dinny want that to me and seen for the first time ever that it could be.   So yes I think the thought of death is absolutely enough to make people quit. And it's really pretty straight forward once you realise these fags will kill you.    Other quit reasons in previous quits, those quits were hard for me and I never managed longer than 22 days.
"We're all gonna die from something...what are you gonna do?"       That and: "I could quit smoking and live longer, but where's the fun in that?"      I was an addict.  Any acknowledgement that my addiction was going to kill me was masked by denial and delusion.  Throw in a bit of gallows humor and I was ready to totally ignore the realities and consequences of my decision to continue smoking.       I was so delusional while smoking, I convinced myself that cigarettes were such an integral part of an enjoyable life that the risks involved with smoking were worth it.       Addiction breeds delusional thinking.  Delusional thinking shapes your perception.  Your perception becomes your reality.

One of those stories a man mentioned his brother died because he was addicted to Marlboros. Now I understand all cigarettes are equally lethal but something about that particular brand pisses me off. Might sound strange but I always thought of that company as the "asshole" of the tobacco industry. Of course I am not at all a fan of anything that is overly masculine.            9 hours ago, Doreensfree said:              Smoking takes all the fear of dying away...

That would **** with someone's head. But since you are quit and plan on keeping them until the end, might I recommend a few different brands of shoes -       Saucony makes the best overall street shoes. Good style, comfortable, durable, all at a fair price. Clark's makes some nice sandals.    B.O.C. makes the most comfortable high heel wedge sandals. The bottoms are cushioned so you won't die after 5 minutes of walking in them.

Havaianas make slightly fancy thongs in many pretty colours....Berkinstock make the overpriced thongs of Europeans and Hipsters.... Blundstone and RM Williams for ya boots, Dunlop for ya runners and UGGs for comfort.
    Thanks ladies ..for all your recommendations....    I'm so grateful to have my feet ..I do go for comfort now ...had to hang up my high heels....I treat them with respect....  Jo !!!!....love my Australian Hugg boots...best thing ever...
    Huff boots ... Yet more evidence of Australia's greatness....moccos are pretty good too.
    Just to remind folks ....It's not just your lungs and heart that smoking effects ....my lungs were fine...I didn't have a cough ...smoking can effect any part of the body ....and it not always where you expect ....  My friend had Pancreatic Cancer.....it was far to late by the time symptoms showed....when she was given her diagnosis ,she carried on smoking ...she believed all the lies that surround this killer addiction...very sad ...  In answer to your question  JB.....Yes ....I was very scared....    When I joined these great people ,I didn't know whether it was too late.... I owe this board alot ....

    I thought smoking would help me grow up faster so I could be an adult and call the shots in my own life.  For me, smoking was freedom.  I finally quit when I was out on a busy hiking trail, and there were older people trotting up mountains, and I was at the bottom gasping while my poor dog waited patiently by my side.   Other peoples' dogs were having a blast, running up the trail.  But my dog had to stand next to me while I wheezed and struggled, and it was just humiliating.  I wasn't thinking about my health, I was just thinking about my lack of dignity.  Sounds so crazy!!!  But there it is.  I just want my dignity, and I also want my genuine freedom, that I gave up the day I started smoking.  
    ^^^ Ironic isn't it ICH?    Started smoking  to find freedom yet now you will actually find freedom by quitting.
    You will get your Dignity. ICH......and a whole lot more ...Freedom is wonderful....soon youj,ll be running that fast,your dog will be panting....
my dad smoked till the day he died at the ripe old age of 56. and yet I smoked for years after word my self but 6 years ago I took my life back and quit. with a lot of help from the great people on here. I will be 56 july 12th so yes I does bother me. but I wont ever smoke again  so if you haven't quit do so now.  its so worth it. sorry my ticker is off but cant get it to count up. so just leaving it as is.Edited March 5 by jimmy
    Where you at Mona.....????? Give us a update .....
    Please help .       I want to restart now
    Hi      Congrats on Quitting        Just don't put anything in your mouth and set fire to it and you should be fine.        if you know why you started again it may be worth doing a list of things or situations to avoid for the first few months;       Post an SOS if you are struggling there is usually someone online to try to help you.
Thanks a lot for the reply despair not .        I have to think positive now .      First time my quit lasted for 6 days .  Second time it lasted for 24 days .     This time this has to be forever
    Let us just be clear.  You did not have to smoke, you chose to smoke. Don't do it again!
Try to remember that the first week is the hardest. Don't torture yourself by repeating the first week withdrawal over and over.        I avoided things that I associated with smoking so I didn't socialise much for 6 months and quit drinking. It worked for me.it may for you. Stick close to this site and read as much as you can to educate yourself.
    @Nancy , @despair not       Thanks for the tips     I will do everything i can to avoid it this time
    You can do it Redemption.  Take smoking off the table.  You don't "have to" smoke.  You choose to.   The secret to quitting is to choose not to smoke.  The control is all yours.  Stay close to the board and let us know when you are struggling most.  I can tell you that if you stick to it, over time, not smoking will become a non issue.  It truly will.
What happened when you all of a sudden chose to purchase and light up a cigarette again after 24 days smoke free? You need to understand what happened this time so you can avoid it again this time. What is your quit plan this time? Is it the same as last time? Last time you used nicotine gum to control your cravings. You have been on this site now for awhile yet you did not reach out to anyone here by posting an SOS on the SOS page. You might have been able to get past your situation if you had posted there and waited for at least 3 replies. SOS posts have saved a lot of quits in the past. I wish you the best in your renewed quit attempt. Please read as much as you can here and learn about nicotine addiction. Have you watched any of the Joel Spitzer Videos? There's a whole library of them on a separate page of the forum. They may help you understand much about this addiction and it's affects on us.
Redemption, it is very difficult to believe you seriously want to quit.  You have been on and off the forum for months.  You have never taken the Nope pledge in all your attempts.  That is all it takes is to pledge nope to smoking and stick to it.  It is not going to happen until you truly want it and work toward that goal.  Only you can change your life.  Edited December 23, 2018 by Linda Thomas
Good to see you back redemption. It took me 7 times to get my forever quit. You will get there. Seems like drink and stress was trigger? Some people do say avoid alcohol early in your quit so maybe you should consider that?

Neither in The Pledge Post, nor any other   A "pledge" is bullsh|t.     Hundreds here. Thousands elsewhere. Millions everywhere, each and every year participate in some sort of pledge or promise...   And yet they still smoke.   A pledge is neither necessary, nor sufficient ... and for most it is a lie.     The only thing that matters is to ACTUALLY PRACTICE Nope.   Practicing Nope is both necessary, and sufficient.  ALL successful quitters live the Nope.  Anyone can write/say some words and pledge the Nope.    Successful Quitters live the Nope.  EZPZ
    The Daily Nope can for many be a powerful tool....and can make the difference between smoking or not ....   Anything that helps us along has got to be good thing ..... Everyone is different ...every quit is different ....   I pledged myself for a long time ...    As long as you keep the promise you pledged ....I say ...go for it ....
    ^^^ I agree that the physical and mental process of actually making that pledge daily, even if it's just silently to yourself, is what sets up the motivation to stay smoke free for that day with many folks. Of course it doesn't mean anything if a person doesn't follow though on it but it's like making a promise to someone else about something. Those don't mean anything either if they aren't kept but speaking the words to start off with defines what kind of a person you are based on the end results and I think most folk want to be seen as decent people who are true to their word. Making the pledge daily certainly doesn't hurt anyone but the person making it if it isn't followed up on.

My goal is to always help others achieve, what I once felt impossible and found difficult to do.

It was very important to me to not only affirm to myself that I wasn't going to smoke that day but also to stand with my fellow NOPers as united in beating this addiction.
    I don't pledge nope therefore it's certainly not all it takes to quit!!         But I wouldn't scoff at those who pledge nope or those who do not.      Just do what ever works for you.             
    NOPE, as a concept  and     NOPE,  as a personal commitment were v. helpful to me in my quit.   Now, the commitment holds   and for me, it is a sense of joyful camaraderie     that continues to encourage me in the NOPE thread.

I do feel the same @Sazerac.  I would wake up many days over the years and say I wasn't going to smoke anymore but did not hold to it.  Pledging with my friends and supporters was different.  They believed in me more than I did and gave me the strength to not let them down!
    Awesome but still not required reading....  Sgt by no means meant it personal....he is his own person but never personal offending people...ideas sure. But we are all on the same side here.   Whatever works.

    You might get help if you tell people why you smoked.       Please don't take this the wrong way but every time you relapse you don't want to be stopped. That is why you tell the forum after you do it. I have done it myself lots of times which is why I recognise it.      It's a bit like people who are only sorry they were unfaithful because they got caught.         I'm glad you've quit again

    I have tried hundreds of times to quit and the only thing that has worked so far is this forum. I check it every day. I also try to nope pledge  everyday. The nope pledge might be symbolic but it is a ritual that I find very useful. Rituals are not fantasy and forming new habits to replace smoking is key. I feel like rituals, habits, pledges all are part of "process", the process of not smoking.
Redemption 3,       You say that you want to restart smoking, but I'd like you to look a bit deeper.     You want to quit smoking.  If you didn't, you would never had quit to begin with.      It's actually the addiction that wants you to restart.          The longer you abstain from smoking the more removed the addiction will be from your person.     Never think for a moment that you want to smoke.
Sgt. Barney,        I gather from the fecal matter present in your posts that you have nothing but contempt     for verbalized commitments.         I did quit and I did, on occasion, pledge.      It can help us conceptualize what we want (or don't want)   and help to renew our commitment by making it a daily,  verbalized, focus of attention.     By making the pledge in public we magnify the commitment as we incur social expectations    and well wishes ...or disappointment.       A pledge is just another tool in our arsenal.       I confess that I am morbidly curious how you might value the concept of prayer in terms of  its usefulness in defeating addiction as, while very similar,  a prayer is an externalized plea wherein a pledge tends to be more of a internalized affirmation.                                                             Edited December 28, 2018 by Sirius
    I think sgt.barney might just be saying a pledge is not enough to stop someone from smoking.        I'm pretty sure if you went back through every pledge thread from when this forum started you would find a lot of people who still relapsed. Everyone who gets married takes a pledge to be with that person forever but look at how many end up in divorce.        I'm certainly not saying the pledge is useless because it clearly helps a lot of people. The truth is though that despite what tools we use none of them can stop us smoking. The only thing that stops us smoking is us.       My humble opinion - don't let pledges, NRT, forums or anything else take any credit. The one thing actually keeping a quit is YOU.       
    Support comes in all shapes and sizes here...   Some is very fluffy..hitting you with a feather duster....there there....stop it ....don't smoke ...    Some use patience...keep on and on and on and on .....telling you smoking is bad for you ...please please stop....  I tend to whack you with a frying pan...if you keep wanting to smoke after you have  quit ...   And some come in wearing boxing gloves... Fighting ...straight talking .... It's what makes this place work ... This is your quit !!!!.....no one else's....it's your life your fighting for ....do whatever you need to ,  Never stick anything in your mouth and smoke it ....NOPE !!!
Personally...pledging helped me keep my quit.... because if I publicly declared it then I felt that I needed to keep my word not to myself but to others.... BUT that's me... My very dear quit buddy Weegie didn't/doesn't NOPE but she is just as successful as i, she didn't need it and I think that is just fine and dandy and she never told me I was wrong or delusional for needing to NOPE never implied it made me a weaker person or a subpar quitter but because she was my mate she supported my need to nope.. just as I supported her need not to NOPE.... me mate Saz.. she quit cold turkey... and me I used NRT for 9 weeks... but hey both of us have kept our quit, neither of us did it the wrong way or a bullshit way... we did it the way that worked for us...and you know what I don't judge those that use methods different to the way that worked for me and I don't disparage those different methods... because why put someone else off or belittle something they find beneficial just because you didn't, let them take the steps they need to get to the end goal without shitting all over them.        Recently I have felt a degree of negativity creeping in here and that anything that deviates from an easy, cold turkey quit is sub par. Its no one person in particular, but its like there is becoming a divide between how one should or should not quit and that is bullshit. You know how one should quit??... whatever bloody way works for them!!. It's kind of off putting and I'm comfy with my quit. I thought the QT was a community to support others in their quit process not to put down anyone who deviates from what worked for you or to belittle and mock what works for another. Or cast doubt on another's approach. Everyone needs to step back, take a deep breath, and chill..... but please don't suggest we sing Kumbaya.      Everyone here has something of value to add, lets respect each other enough to let them say it. Sure we can disagree but we can disagree without mocking or insulting the alternate opinion... who can throw the biggest insult has nothing to do with winning an argument and just makes your opinion seem tacky and loose value. See the way I see it we all have a right to our opinions and unless someone is on here saying the only way to successfully quit is to sacrafice a kitten at dawn each day... is it really any skin off your nose if the advice they offer doesn't match your experience. Sure, share that you disagree, hell I'll argue for your right to disagree, we need diversity, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater just cos it didn't work for you.      Now just saying... only 2 months ago anyone had of told our @Linda Thomas her NOPE pledge was bullshit and meant nothing she would have slinked away and probably never come back, possibly had a smoke or 10 too, but our girl done gone and growed herself a big set of hairy quit balls (kinda proud down here in Aus).... so sure, disagree with each other, the varied opinions and approaches are what make the QT work but please do so and still respect the other person's right to have an opinion that is different and not mock, insult or belittle them. Sure there are failed quitters who NOPEd every day... but there are also quitters in there who have been NOPEing for 3 years or more so sweeping generalisations that it means nothing and is pointless are just that..... pointless. Cbdave and Johnny5 NOPE every day... along with a cast of others... who are all successful at being quit... there is some evidence that for some it does work... for some it is a necessary ritual and lets rejoice at the difference ... how boring would life be if we all were the same.         Now as someone else liked to say "let's get this thread back on track"... this comments for @Redemption3 .... hope you are still quit.... No issue with wanting to start again... because lots of us have had more than one quit start... but mate, lets get serious here, lets put our big boy (and girl) pants on and have a good hard look at things... you can start again, and again, and again... keep starting when you fail because one day it will stick... but you need to learn from the failed quits... you need to own the fact you are an addict and Potts mate, you need to be honest with yourself... this is not your third quit... not since you joined the boards at least... you have had multiple quits, know how I know, because I have been here for all of them... its not just 2.. I am pointing this out because you need to be honest with yourself to be successful at quitting. Your 2 best quits have been 6 days and 24 days... but there have been many other 3-4 day quits in there since you joined. You can quit... for good, for ever, but you have to be strong enough to not smoke. You don't loose a quit, you throw it away... we can't do this for you mate, none of us have the miracle cure, we all went about it different ways... some of us read everything we could, some of us played all the games.... some of us posted silly pictures of cats and made bad jokes... some of us swapped recipes and exercise tips... some of us used NRT... some of us relapsed again, and again...some of us pledged... but all of us did not put something in our mouth and did not set it on fire. For some of us it is as easy as saying I don't smoke anymore and they are done, the evidence is in, some people are just that fortunate to have that much willpower.... then others of us battle every day to fight the urge to smoke, getting stronger everyday.... and then others fall somewhere in the middle... What I do know is you want to quit, you wouldn't keep going through those first 3 days if you didn't... you wouldn't keep posting here, copping criticism if you didn't really want to quit... I suspect there is a degree that your posts get twisted with meanings due to English not being your first language... but I wasn't going to post here for 2 reasons... 1 "I had to smoke"... you didn't have to smoke, you wanted to smoke... lets be honest buddy... you did not have to smoke, you life did not depend on it, nooone held a gun to your head, stuck a smoke in your mouth and told you to smoke... you chose to smoke... where was the sos??? where was the hey QT I am day 24 but a want to smoke .... nope you smoked, and then you came back and said I want to start again.... of course you want to quit again... there is no benefit to smoking... being smoke free is wonderful (after you get past the worst of the craves, and thoughts)....and 2 because you need to be honest with yourself and accept you are an addict.. which I don't think you do.... Just do one thing for me... let me know what you learnt from the last time you lost your quit... use those lessons to grow this quit into your forever quit.
    Great post Jo! Well put.    This is a place of support for anyone and everyone who truly wants to quit, no matter what their methods. 
    I've been here for over five years ....this is the first time of my knowledge that the NOP E thread ,has ever come to be questioned ....    It's here for a reason....  It a daily pledge you won't smoke that day ...a promise to yourself ....    Yes OK...some have pledged and then later smoked ...thier choice to break a promise ...but the help and support it gives to the those that  keep their promise is as  I have said before .  Very powerful...    No one here should be made to feel uncomfortable in Pledging ...it's a choice ....  I just want to add...I love watching those pledges ,some are very funny ...and clever...
    Let's not get caught up in majoring in the minors.      If the pledge works for you, do it.     If the pledge is something that you don't care about, forget it.        The only compulsory rule for a successful quit is this: Do Not Smoke!       "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing." --Stephen R. Covey
    The NOPE pledge worked for me because I would never break a pledge to myself.  Once it was done each morning, I knew I had to make it through that day.  Then I got to choose again the next day.

Quitting smoking isn't forever. It's just this moment, this hour, just today.   As long as you stay present-focused, and you're saying, "not today," you'll achieve your goal.      For me, when it's night and it's dark, my willpower wanes and I crave more intensely.   When I'm asleep, I don't crave, so I go to bed early. As early as 5:30 or 6:00 pm on occasion.  When I wake up, I am stronger and still present-focused: "Not this moment, not this hour, not today."
I pointed this out when I was new to the forum and nearly got banned over it.   I guess for some it helps though. For me, I just got tired of all the BS that came with smoking and decided to clean house.     Of course at first I didn't have too hard a time quitting and people got mad over that also. I was thinking, "Excuse me for having some G.D. willpower".                On 12/28/2018 at 11:28 PM, sgt.barney said:                                 If a pledge were worth a shit, no one on this forum (or any other) taking said pledge would smoke.          The evidence is in.

    JB I don't think it was so much that you spoke about how easy it was for you but more the way you spoke about it that got other's backs up.         Sure you have every right to be proud of your will power and how easy you had it, you earnt that pride but to those of us that struggled, or who used different methods to quit than the way you posted about it came across as condescending and as a put down as if anyone who was struggling or had a different quit to how yours was were inferior. I think that was what upset others.     Personally I read back post of yours that triggered me early in my quit and I can see what it was that triggered me but it was equally about my own insecurities with my quit. Some of your earlier posts if you did them again now I'd probably still jump down ya throat for em but it would be more because they can be off putting to newbies or lurkers cos they could be quite negative....that said...we all have different experiences to bring to the board and for every person who doesn't appreciate your approach there will be someone who does. 
    Part of what helped me ease off the cancer sticks though - for about two years prior I mostly smoked roll-your-own smokes. The Top-o-matic machine with the crank handle that crammed tobacco into a tube.  The tobacco sold in bags is cheap for a reason - it sucks. Probably lower nicotine. It is like the "low calorie" version of your favorite comfort food.     I do not know how easy or hard it would have been if I were smoking real cigarettes.
Hello , i have not been able to post about my quitting journey for a while now but ,    I have not smoked any cigarettes since the last 3 weeks .       Well its been really more than 3 weeks away from smoke .        And i am very happy these days .        I have been using nicotine gums for the past 3 weeks .      I had no mood to post for the last few weeks , because it was mostly talking a pledge and breaking it after a week or two .     But this time i did it .        I do not remember the exact date but i am sure it been more than 3 weeks .      I feel a lot more healthier now     What i learned is that , talking to the right people is so important and talking to the wrong people can make you feel mental .     Some people are simply useless talking to
    Well Potts, it is good to see you back and I hope this is the final time for you.  
    Thanks for the reply Linda ,        I am taking another break from the forums .     Sometimes it so important to talk something else .      I have been looking for some other good health related discussion forum too .       Anyway i will be back after February .      Now i know all the tricks and tools to avoid smoking
Welcome back Potts.     >3 weeks is nearly a month buddy... whatever you are doing stick to it... its working.
An interesting exchange of ideas and a fairly civil discourse I might add. I feel for the relapse and am glad for anyone back on the wagon (Train).     The mechanics of NOPE are flawless and living it assures perfection,  and a forever quit. There are other ways that lead to the same end, and having seen those struggles and final successes over the years prove that these alternative paths are effective as well.      But in the end it's all about staying quit isn't it, pledging and doing or living the NOPE?         After all of the hyperbole, no matter how you choose to get there you will never achieve freedom from addiction to nicotine by delivering more nicotine into your system. The Law of Addiction paraphrased I suppose.       KTQ     Markus      Quit 2-18-2008   Edited February 27 by Markus11Para
End of February too , No smoke went in  .       Some cravings in 2 or 3 days , i go out and eat a nicotine gum and its gone .       I think it is officially over .     Thank god
Um Potts....wot is your quit date? Are you nearly 2 months smoke free? This is awesome news! You sneaky quitter hiding in the background.. please let us know how long smoke free so we can all celebrate with you.
"I think it is officially over"     Be careful:  that can be a dangerous attitude at what is still an early point in your recovery.  Remain vigilant--your life depends on it.      Christian 99    17+ Years Quit
@notsmokinjo        Thanks for the reply        I have clearly finished 2 months without smoking . I feel really good , there was cravings but it was not that strong .     I have even managed to avoid smoking without using gums for at least 7 days .       I keep buying these gums these days so that i can chew it whenever i feel really bored .        One important thing i learned is that the cravings for a smoke is always there , you simply stop thinking about cigarettes .That is the best way to avoid it .      I don't even think about cigarettes  much these days , It does not interest me anymore , which is a really good thing .         @Christian99        Thanks for the reply .      Well , whenever i get bored i think of everything else other than cigarettes .      Thanks for all the support
    "cravings for a smoke is always there"  This is untrue. Cravings exist while you maintain your addiction to nicotine.   When you quit nicotine, cravings fade away.
Fuzzy memories of a member who touted a 10 year quit, then one day on the boards copped to 6 years of it having a nicotine gum habit. Can't you feel that hell behind the skull bones, and the devil crunching the numbers?         Whatever works, but that formula never includes more nicotine delivery long term. Smoke free is a start, but nicotine free is the monkey off of your back. Its an affliction.  This whole quit thing is a mind game, so choose wisely, no matter how much you think you have it clinched, be it  a month or a decade free.      KTQ     Markus      Quit 2-18-2008
Next stop no more NRT gum...but mate be very proud of your 2 months smoke free....that's huge and you have done it....I was still using NRT at 2 months too....it got much easier when I stopped the nrt...the smoking thoughts were less too.  My goal was to be NRT free by 3months...I think I went a little over...but I new when it was time for me and you will too.
My thoughts about NRT gum was always - "wow, that is not cheap! Wouldn't it be cheaper to quit cold turkey?"    I don't know, it just seemed like taking up smoking cessation of any kind would just be a lateral move. Plus some commercials had people saying, "I tried everything. slowing down, gums, patches, hypnosis, nothing worked... but then this new product came along." I thought "Well if none of those things work to make someone quit smoking, why waste cash on them? And what if this "new" product failed? Even when I was a kid and thought "I will never smoke", somehow I knew cessation products were a load of bull.              20 hours ago, Markus11 said:                Fuzzy memories of a member who touted a 10 year quit, then one day on the boards copped to 6 years of it having a nicotine gum habit.

    NRT worked for me Potts...took the edge off enough so my crazy arse could get over that quit line....so it does work for some....and for others it doesn't....but it's working for you too so keep learning.
    I remember the 'intense face with uninterested posture' was one of the aspects of smoking I liked doing, as a teen. It was undeniable: 'Wow that girl is one with her cigaret and look how she LIVES that attitude'.        They feel the same in Sons of Anarchy. Luckily they get to blow party whistles!          
    What is a crime is you carry on Smoking !!!!    Ok you have failed ,maybe more than once ....so what !!!!!..... Keep going ...keep trying ....do you really what to end up with a smokers illness..or worse ??? Just put it behind you ...and start again....   What have you got to lose ..NOTHING.....but could gain...EVERYTHING.....    Do it today !!!!!
    Never give up giving up....because eventually you will get your sticky quit....but you have to try.. if at first you don't succeed, try and try again...learn from each attempt, take away the he positives...focus on those.
    No, relapsing is not a crime.   If that were the case, there's a few here that would be on death row in San Quentin by now for the number of relapses.
    Quitting is serious business and not often a walk in the park in the beginning. You must 'Embrace The Suck' as our friend, The Sarge, says and hold tight to your resolve.      Your commitment to yourself is fundamental as is understanding the addiction.   The rewards are innumerable and you will never regret quitting  you will only regret not quitting sooner.    
I agree relapsing is not a crime.   It is a big deal,   Not a crime.    It is an alarm to let you know it is time to re-evaluate.   Re-evaluate your reasons for quitting.  Re-evaluate your readiness to quit. Re-evaluate your real knowledge of your addiction.  Re-evaluate the relapse.    Toss the pack, take a shower, brush your teeth and  Restart your quit STAT.Edited February 28 by Lust4Life
    If the Sarge were here, he might say -  "Crap or get off the pot"        
    Pity we can't all have loose bowls..takes some a while longer to work their shit out.
Relapsing doesn't mean that you can't quit smoking and certainly doesn't mean that you shouldn't quit smoking immediately.  If you've relapsed, it's important to understand this addiction and more importantly to treat your smoking as a drug addiction and work at keeping your life free of cigarette smoking and nicotine regardless of the delivery method.      Relapsing isn't a crime but smoking is punishable by death.      Video discusses the concept of whether a cigarette induced death should be considered a murder, suicide or an accident.        "So I failed in quitting smoking, big deal. I'm not going to feel guilty or be hard on myself. I mean, it is only cigarette smoking - it is not like a crime punishable by death." I had to refrain from laughing at this statement. It was seriously quoted to me by a clinic participant who failed to abstain from smoking for even two days. She had the same old excuses of new job, family pressures, too many other changes going on.        But to say that cigarette smoking isn't a crime punishable by death - that was news to me. According to the United Nations, tobacco kills 4.9 million users per year. While we know that these people were killed by tobacco, it is hard to classify these deaths. Were they murders, suicides or accidents?        When examining the influence of the tobacco industry, one is tempted to call all tobacco related deaths murder. The tobacco industry uses manipulative advertising trying to make smoking appear harmless, sexy, sophisticated, and adult. These tactics help manipulate adults and kids into experimenting with this highly addictive substance. The tobacco industry knows that if they can just get people started, they can hook them on cigarettes and milk them for thousands of dollars over the smokers' lifetimes.     The tobacco institute always contradicts the research of all credible medical institutions that have unanimously stated that cigarettes are lethal. The tobacco institute tries to make people believe that all these attacks on cigarettes are lies. If the medical profession was going to mislead the public about cigarettes, it would be by minimizing the dangers, not exaggerating them. The medical profession has a vested interest in people continuing to smoke. After all, the more people smoke, the more work there is in treating serious and deadly diseases. But the medical profession recognizes its professional and moral obligation to help people be healthier. On the other hand, the tobacco industry's only goal is to get people to smoke, no matter what the cost.      It could be argued that a smoking death is suicide. While the tobacco industry may dismiss the dangers, any smoker with even average intelligence knows that cigarettes are bad for health but continues to smoke anyway. But I do not believe in classifying most of the smoking deaths as suicidal. Although a smoker knows the risk and still doesn't stop, it is not that he is trying to kill himself. He smokes because he doesn't know how to stop.      A smoking related death is more accidental than suicidal. For while the smoker may die today, his death was in great part due to his first puffs twenty or more years ago. When he started smoking the dangers were unknown. Society made smoking acceptable, if not mandatory in certain groups. Not only did he not know the danger, but also he was unaware of the addictive nature of nicotine. So by the time the dangers were known, he was hooked into what he believed was a permanent way of life. Any smoker can quit, but unfortunately many don't know how.     Whatever the classification–murder, suicide or accident–the end result is the same. You still have a chance, you are alive, and you know how to quit. Take advantage of this knowledge. Don't become a smoking statistic – NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!     © Joel Spitzer 1983
I smoked a pack of JACS tonight.  Tsk tsk for shame on me. Maybe not a whole pack.  A bunch of tokes over the course of an hour or so.  I'm over 2 years quit and I needed my fix.  Life happens.  People suck.  Wine is delicious. A moment to reflect.  To feel, think, hear my breath, feel my lungs inflate.   Inflate with the unaltered air surrounding me.   JACs are Jillar's Air Cigs.  I coined the phrase in 2016.  Back then I was a straw smoker.  It worked.  For me and maybe others.  The battle I fought wasn't really the nicotine.  It was the ritual.  The inhales and exhales.  Screw yoga.  There was something therapeutic about watching the smoke.  I tried NON-nicotine alternatives to mimic the fluid dynamics of those streams- before I quit quitting and Quit.  The "smoke" was therapeutic.   This is another battle to fight and overcome when quitting.  So much is focused on the nicotine addiction.  There is a mental addiction that is, for some like me, more difficult to overcome.        So- for those like me that were more addicted to the act of smoking- do not be ashamed to pretend to smoke thr/ a straw or thr/ your own pursed lips against your fingers.  The end usually justifies the means.  Figure out how and why you wish to live a longer and healthier life and make it happen.  It will suck along the way.  Be sure to stop and breathe unaltered air.
    Yeah, going through the motions without inhaling nicotine is harmless. Placebo effect maybe.    It is kind of like punching something soft and pretending it is the neighbor or boss you hate. It offers a small part of the satisfaction but with none of the consequence.
    No question in my mind that all the other things surrounding nicotine addiction are the things that take the longest to readjust to. Otherwise, we'd be fine after a few days not pumping nicotine into our bodies. Oh no. It's all those mental associations we need to break. That's what takes the time and is what really tests our determination to break free of this addiction once and for all.
    I missed the ceremony of Fire.  Not clear on whether I really missed it or if it was the voice of the addict.   I used matches to start my stove instead of the automatic spark for a while then, forgot about the 'ceremony of Fire'.   
    I also used deep breathing but, didn't need the hand to mouth action so much.       Taking a break on my back stoop to think with a smoke was a serious pattern but,    taking the break on my back stoop to think and breathe became the sustainable ritual.   Oxygen is delicious.
Oh yes lust, you know I love my JAC too. I still use it from time to time.  Edited February 22 by jillar
    Regular gum.... Had to keep my mouth busy....my punching pillow for those moments when I needed to let go of some steam !!!!
    I remember the JAC and good to see that most here understand the what ever it takes is good,    if sucking on a sraw, pincel, pretzel or what ever helps ease that nagging I want to smoke urge its a good thing.   For me it was and is Hard candy and I have sucked a long hard slow breath between my puckered lips on more  than one occation.  Thank you Jill its been a while and I really want you to know,  you were, you are and you always will be appreciated
Sarge sucked on an empty E-Cig for a good 3 weeks.  Shaped like a cigarette. Looked like a cigarette. Gave him something to put in his hands and suck on like a cigarette ... but just sucking air. Sarge's Pops tried quitting with E-Cigs and it still hasn't worked for Pops Sarge to this day ... but the empty sucking of air really worked in those first few weeks for Sarge himself.    EZPZ

    So for me, the most disturbing statement in that is big tobacco identifying vaping as "a potentially safer alternative" ..... 'potentially' playing semantics for defense against future class actions. 
Gday    bigbtabacco would love to be able to sell nicotine vapes in Australia. Sure they love to see in law so they could get a monoply again.  But no one can sell nicotine vape. That’s everyone! As an individual you can buy and import a personal supply. When I checked it was a max of 3 months personal  supply.    But you can’t sell it. That’s illegal.  Off course big tabacco is pissed off cause it can’t control the market! WA is illegal to sell vape equipement of any sort which is diferent to the other states. Big tabacco would love to explote that difference. But from what I’ve read the evidence coming in from around the world doesn’t support the much touted therory that vaping is a pathway to giving up smoking but rather that it has little effect in cutting smoking rates. Big tabacco hasn’t got much to fight with!

It’s been 2 years since I’ve had a smoke.That’s roughly 15,000 cigarettes not smoked. That number blows my mind.        2 years since I decided that living is more important than choosing to slowly kill myself.      2 years since I decided it was more important to grow old with the one that I love than to put something in my mouth and light it on fire.      It seems so long ago and far away that I hardly remember what it was like to be a smoker and sometimes even forget that I was.      2 years of freedom      It makes me mad that my old man, who was a hell of a lot tougher than I am, couldn’t quit. He’d give it up for lent every year (and what a miserable 40 days that was), but he’d start right back up every time.        It makes me sad that he chose smoking over me and my brothers and sisters. Cigarettes were more important than living to see his children and grandchildren grow old.   He smoked up to his final days and took his last breath at the age of 56. I think he would have been a cool old man, but I’ll never know.       **** cigarettes
you Know what makes me Mad !  My Father never smoked, Never Drank, didn't use salt, road his Bicycle to work and back every day for years,His biggest sin Dr Pepper.  He died of a Massive Heart attack age 67, that is seven years more than I am now.     Super work on your two years Jim, I know the Forum would rather see you still quit than to Spank you with the wet noddles.      Keep up the Great work,  Its good to have successful quiter to look up to.  Once again Jim
Warmest congrats on 2 years, Jim!       Christian99
G’day Jim   2 years.... sounds so simple, but if I remember rightly it wasn’t all plain sailing for you. You fell off the wagon and had to get back up. Well done and well deserved 2 years C
You do not remember correctly.  I quit on Feb 9 2017 and haven't touched a cigarette since. I didn't "fall off the wagon".      Thanks though.
I cannot help but wonder why your dad never just quit completely if he was able to make it 40 days without. We all know the crave cycles and we also know if one can make it for 40 days, then staying off the cigarettes is not that hard by that point. The worst is the first week.      Assuming he passed roughly 20 years ago,  back then there wasn't as much support for people trying to quit.
    Same reason millions of people die from smoking. He didn't want to quit. He loved smoking and didn't care that it would kill him.

He loved smoking and didn't care that it would kill him.               I think a lot of us enjoyed the calming effect.  We enjoyed that, but no the bad parts. I imagine though when someone dies of smoking related illness, they probably didn't truly believe smoking would kill them. Some of us though, like myself, kept thinking, "What if I really could die early from smoking?"  Maybe some just come to that realization way too late.
Here is a vid from, our friend, Joel     I know I wanted to 'push the river'and be completely done with craves or triggers quickly (like immediately !)but, to be realistic, it was a full year and a bit more for craves and triggers to back off into oblivion.    In fact, at 10 months, I had a big hurdle.  I was having craves and using them to get in the way of my work (painting).It was akin to writers block but, I was blaming nicotine and whining about quitting.The addiction had changed so many brain receptors and I hadn't dealt with all of them.Not a little disheartened, I wrote in my blogMy Life As One Big Smoke Triggerand the response was heartening.Paul, Action, Marti, Chrysalis and Tinkall gave me their encouragement and I was able to push through.    So, if you are well into your quit and still having moments of despair,please hang on.  It gets better.  You get stronger and your brain gets reclaimed.It just takes time.
    I don't experience cravings anymore.        Let me rephrase that.   I have not experienced a craving in quite some time.        Same with the smoking dreams.  That stuff is in the past.       If I am around people who smoke there is no trigger.  Just a mild annoyance.        You are free from smoking when its no longer a question you bother to ask.      As Sazerac says, it just takes time.
    The craves disappear.       All of them. After a few  years, there are only old memories left.      If they did not, we would never quit smoking permanently.           Cristóbal
Been smoke free for 5 weeks and the cravings are still driving me crazy... I gave in today. I had 2 cigs and they tasted horrible but they did soothe the goddamn itch that I’ve been struggling with for weeks. This is the first time I’ve smoked since my quit date. I’m so tired of distracting myself and I’m all out of willpower. I don’t want to relapse although that would be so easy at this point. Are these cravings ever going to go away? And when do I get my energy back? All I want to do is sleep lately..... I’m getting fat and no one even cares about or supports me quitting. Feels like I’ve taken my only coping strategy away from myself and now I’m just depressed and socially anxious. Edited February 17 by del
Del - you're in a terrible spot. 2 cigs is a relapse. The cravings will eventually become something that don't seem so overwhelming, but only if you don't never have another puff.     Take a breath, remember the things that helped you decide to quit. If you don't smoke then smoking can't hurt your health any further. Smoking can't rob you have energy if you don't do it. Sleeping is good for your body, and you can deal with weight as you get further away from your quit date.      I don't remember any magic formula that made any of the crappy part of quitting go away. It sucks, and the only thing that actually makes it go away is time.       You've made a great decision to quit, it's ok to want to snap, freak out, and stamp your feet, but if you take a puff it all starts again.      This can be a great place to get support when everyone around you seems not to care.        Take a breath del and be at peace as best you can.      R
    Hi and welcome Del...   You had a good quit going ...   You have a train full of quitters here ,who will tell you YES...it does get easier...and the only way this happens is if .....  You Never Stick Anything In Your Mouth And Set Fire To It ....  This is the place to be for Support...we all understand and have been where you are ...my advice...Dust Down ...    Read all you can here...stay around ...post often ...Learn about this awful Addiction....   We have all Quit ...you are no different ,you can and will if you want it bad enough...
    Welcome del, I know how you feel. The first few months are the hardest but they are doable. I too had absolutely no energy. I found that sucking on candy really helped both the craves and the foggy head feeling. I also let my body dictate what it needed in order to try to repair all the damage done by smoking. So if it was hungry, I ate. Tired, I slept, etc.    Also when you get a bad crave you can come on here and post an SOS letting us know you need some extra support. We will come running to help you past it. I did a couple times and they worked  The last tool I used for a good six months was my air cigarette. I just pretended I was holding an actual cigarette then went through the motions of "smoking" it. It worked great at tricking my mind into thinking it was getting the real thing.
    Welcome to the train Del     You've had some great advice already. You now have to decide if you want to get this done or not because, it WILL take an unwavering commitment and follow through to be successful.    Those annoying craves will go away but you need to stick with your commitment not to smoke to make that happen. Knowledge about this addiction and how it works is another key component. Everything to do with that knowledge is available for you here. Read all you can here on the site and watch the Joel videos. All are informative. Knowing how this addiction works will improve your chances of success because you can then outsmart it rather than trying to just fight it. And support from others who are on the same journey as you are is surprisingly helpful. You'll get support here not just for a week or two but for your entire time here on the train. Support and a sharing of helpful information - you can't beat that       So now it's down to you - what will you choose? Continued addiction or a better life smoke free? Get rid of any cigs you have & let's get this done!
    Welcome aboard Del, good to have you along for the journey.  The craves stick around for a bit but after time it does get much better, the first month can be pretty hard then slowly you learn to fight the craves.  Read here and educate yourself, you will see that we hall have gone thru this.  Also come along and post and learn from everyone's experience -- it will help greatly and doing the NOPE pledge each day -- it really did help me.

del,Craves NEVER go away if you smoke, you live in a perpetual circle of craves.Every twenty minutes or so, nicotine levels plummet and create a crave.      .           When you quit, you free yourself from nicotine's  tyranny.Edited February 17 by Sazerac

I found that the people around me were largely disinterested in my quit.  Even my doctor (who had been telling me to quit) barely acknowledged it.      Don’t expect daily applause from casual friends and coworkers, especially as time goes by.  Find a family member or someone who has quit or is also trying to quit, they would provide that positive feedback for you.  This forum is full of successful quitters who will tell you how awesome you (and us) are for quitting and maintaining the quit, but you will still have to do the hard work yourself, no one can do it for you.     I mean, sure, non-smokers had encouraging words when I told them I was quitting, but they never circled back to ask how it was going.   Non smokers think quitting is as easy as it would be to stop toasting your bagel in the morning.  They have no idea the physiological and emotional roller coaster you’re on        Current smokers had encouraging words up front, but will tend to avoid you after, neither encouraging or discouraging.  I think it’s because they’re  envious that you a) had the courage to quit and b) of your continued success.  I’m ashamed to say that I was this was how I felt as a smoker when one of my smoking buddies quit.  I felt validated when they relapsed and started smoking again.     And sadly, some smokers will try to lure you back, because misery loves company.  Best avoid those people entirely.Edited February 17 by Wayne045
Mental Balloons Posted by gonfishn21 on 16 January 2015 - 06:17 PM  As I'm now chasing the tweenie label, and have been thinking a lot about the concerns I have had regading No Man's Land, its got me thinking again. As most of you know, that means I'm going to ramble.    Although I am not one that needs a lot of kudos, it seems that it is a necessary part of this process for a while.  We make it through day 1 HURRAH!!!!!!!!!!   We make it through hell week HURRAY!!!! Heck week over, " I feel better" HURRAy!!   Two weeks, wow, learning to get through the craves, HURRay! Three weeks, can be around my friends and family without committing a felony, HURray    Four weeks, nerves under control, waistband a little tight, not bad, HUrray Five weeks, walking, eating right, digestion shut down, but not smoking, Hurray Six weeks, no craves, no moods, no smoking, digestion shut down, HUH?   Seven to eight weeks, no one wants to know but you, how you are doing. By the way, my digestion is shut down!   They really stopped wanting to hear weeks ago, you just kept talking about it. You can see it in their eyes when you walk up. They probably have a pool about how long it will take you to bring it up. Or even worse, the day your digestion works!    Yeah, wow woot woot yippee, big deal.   Hello No Man's Land'    How am i going to keep going with this? I need to bring my own ballons to the party. I know my friends and family care, but they dont get it.   Even as firm as I have been since day one, this is one of the hardest things I have ever done. I know it, thats all that matters.   As i reach the little milestones ahead, I need to be the one who says HURRAY!!!!!.  I need to be the one who acknowledges the accomplishments. Afterall, in the end, I made the decision to quit, I made it through hell week, heck week, and i am the one who may never digest food again. I need to remind myself everyday, how much I have accomplished, BEFORE I have a chance to get weak. In that way, I can stay ahead, be ready to face any challenge with a strong defense.    Smoking is no longer an option for me. Smoking is just something I used to do. I control my actions, and smoking is a choice. I choose not to smoke, even if I never digest food again. I found a website the other day, that actually teaches you HOW TO SMOKE. I couldn't believe it. It takes you through lighting it, drawing on it, how it feels.......Holy Crap I was feeling it!!!!! Two flipping months into this, and I was feeling it, and then I knew. I had to make mental ballons and carry them with me at all times. Everyday is a celebration, everyday needs reminders, and everyday has its challenges. There is no one here, that can not do it. I'm not special. I'm just going to carry my own balloons.   Just sayin, Gon
You know Del, it's mighty brave of you to own up and mention you relapsed. It's pricking you inside somewhere and you want to get back on your quit, that's why you posted.     you've got the accountability part down to a tee, now for the execution part. Everyone of the stalwarts before me have given you amazing advice, and i'll only probably be repeating what they've said, but repetition helps commit things to memory so here goes...        A crave lasts 3-4 minutes, all you have to do is distract your mind for those 3-4 minutes by watching stuff, reading, getting up and making yourself a cup of joe, or tea or whatever you like. If you're at work then getting up, taking a small walk, talking to a co-worker...just force your brain to think about something else, and that crave will go.   It is highly possible another one will come up, but gradually you'll see these craves reducing in number...it may not look like it now, but it certainly does get easier.       I wish you the best of luck, please stay close to the forum, we love hearing success stories

It really doesnt get any simpler than that!       I whish you determination with your decision, there's absolutely no reason why you wouldn't be able to make it. Instead of idontknowhowmanytoxiccomponents, suck in all the information you can get, pick what works for you, vent, spoil yourself, scream, exercise, do yoga, stand on your head, take on a new hobby, talk to your support system about what you need.        Please let us know how you are doing, it will help us  in offering you much needed support.
    Hi Del, glad you're here because this is where you do really get the support that...i agree with you...is often lacking from friends and family who don't always understand. My son hated me smoking yet after I quit he barely mentioned it!  At the end of the day you do it for yourself, reading the celebrations here after each month of quitting were an enormous personal boost and learning about addiction was the biggest help of all. All the physical symptoms will ease off soon and you can worry about the extra bit of weight in a little while. Hope you get back on track with the quit and hope you stick around here 
Don't be a DumbAss. If they never went away ... why would we quit?  Of course they go away.     Sarge hasn't craved a cigarette in over 7 years.    ... but you can't get there if you keep doin' stupid sh*t, like smokin' ... right?  EZPZ
    I am still wondering how someone can go several weeks and not be able to find the strength to not light up. Sure there are tough times but does someone really think, "Just a couple won't hurt".

So it's like this. You either smoke or you don't smoke.     If you've committed to not smoking, you won't smoke. That's it. You'll deal with the cravings, the lack of energy, the mood swings and the frustration and everything else that goes along with it.     Sorry, but if you were committed, you wouldn't have smoked those two cigarettes. You need to get your sh*t together, get your head on straight and decide if you're going to smoke or not.      You are no more addicted to smoking than anyone else and it's no harder for you than it was for any of us. I struggled for 9 months. It sucked and sometimes I hated it, but I committed to not smoking, so I never did (and never will again). Who cares if no one is supporting you? You're not quitting for them. You're quitting for YOU! So what if you get fat. You'll lose the weight. This isn't a time for vanity.     You need to make a decision and stick with it. Either you smoke or you don't smoke. End of story.Edited February 19 by JimHannoonen
And to answer your question. No, the cravings will never go away if you smoke two cigarettes every 5 weeks.

Many millions of people have quit before you. Any discomfort you have experienced, many others have experienced the same thing. Do not think your experiences are unique.     Invest some time in yourself, your quit and your future, and start reading and watching videos about quitting smoking.

Great video.  There's a lot of talk about the long-term benefits of quitting, but the positive effects of quitting begin immediately.  From there, the benefits increase exponentially.
It's amazing how quickly the body rebuilds. I think it's been about 3 years and 3 months for me now.  I can't even imagine being that ashamed little addict anymore.  And for 20 years I couldn't imagine being anything other than a smoker.  I thought I loved it.  Being a smoker was just embarrassing.  Truly the urge goes away 100%.It can and must be done.
Truly the urge goes away 100%.It can and must be done. It can and must be done.  Thank you,  Madame.

    Some ads, like for Salem, show people having fun hiking, skiing, snow sledding, out for a walk, etc.    Has anyone stopped to think, what if, what if what the ads were REALLY trying to say was, "This is the kind of fun you will have if you do use our product".        There was one where it shows two women and a man on a sled. They are laughing, full of energy, and just look to be having a blast. Smokers can't laugh or move fast without choking half to death.  I know in my case, when I could not even laugh at sick jokes without coughing, I knew it was time to quit.      But yeah, I think the ads showing anything sexy, fun, energetic, mysterious, whatever... maybe it was showing the life you could enjoy as a NON smoker.                 
    Always young, sexy people in those print ads.  Almost never a middle-aged or elderly person,  cause they would’ve looked like, well smokers who can’t walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded

At almost 6 months (i admit... this is also just an excuse to talk about these awesome upcoming 6 months...) my quit is carrying me, instead of the other way 'round. I cling to it like a lifesaver. Last week I had a few really tough days. The joy I experienced afterwards, after NOT lighting up, is so extremely satisfying and self-confidence boosting, daimn.     I can honestly say (and this is huge to grasp!!) the  'Ahhh, thank god I didn't light up!!! I am good at this and I am going to make it to the one year mark!!'  is 1000000x bigger than the 'Ahhhhh, my receptors are having a nicotine orgasm while I almost vomit and curse myself for giving in'.   Do your study, keep telling yourself how great you are for choosing life because you can't expect that from anyone else... and... trust the proces. And all will be fine in the end. Promise.
I lurked for 10 months after I quit and have a great affection for lurkers. There is a lot of scholarly information about nicotine addiction here   and our stories are a treasure trove of anecdotal evidence proving that anybody can quit.       The support provided here is another asset to a successful quit. Plus, we have some fun.        MLMR has one of the best documented quits.  Her journey has been a joy for all of us to witness.    So, believe her when she says, 'trust the process and all will be fine in the end'.  She doesn't lie.
    Just do it !!!.....what have you got to lose ....nothing .....  You have everything to gain.... You might surprise yourself .!!!!!.......so why not try ....    We are so proud of MLMR.....
    The weekend is upon us. GREAT time to quit. Put the smokes down and pamper yourself luxuriously.    You will never regret quitting, never ever.
    I floated different ideas to get people to quit before.     One was the smell- if they knew how bad the smell really was, I mean cat litter stink, they might smoke less and definitely hide it more.       New idea....teeth.  If they saw the yellow more...Saw the results...might embarrass them to smoke less and eventual quit.       We need a slogan.  Different ones for different areas.  Something like  "Smoke if you want British smile"       Or for booger- "kiss your cousin with that breath?"     Canadian version "smoking tar sticks to maple syrup after breakfast puffers"         The New Jersey could combine smell and teeth... Since they are know for both smell and smiles....      Southern....y'all tooth fairy can't afford you smoking....
    That's it? One like? Nobody offended? Nothing to say?  P!ace is getting boring
    There is hardly anyone here!  I'm getting ready for the big day and worry that I might be celebrating by myself.

    Moo ve over cat face.  Your speaking with a genuine super hero and brain washing is my special power.  Ask my three wives.          If I can get you to think it....it's real. And dental embarrassment is the new idea.  Insulting others is just the by product.  So if your from Kentucky and love both front teeth, don't smoke.   
    People putting disgusting things in their mouths is hardly new if there is a perceived benefit.     Also, I noticed you didn't say ex-wives... so... umm... you from Utah?                       
    A Trip to the British Dentist is never .......safe ....lol....

    Yeah if Bakon has been married three times and STILL found the willpower to quit smoking... then no one needs to tell him about strength.        
'If you're a smoker, quit now,' Albany lung cancer victim writes in his obituary    Associated Press |  Feb 20, 2019 | 11:55 AM Geoff Turner died from lung cancer due to smoking — but he didn't want others to suffer the same fight. (Sue Ogrocki / Associated Press)    ALBANY — An upstate man who recently died of lung cancer has a simple message in his obituary: “If you're a smoker — quit now.” The Times Union of Albany reports 66-year-old Geoff Turner wanted to warn others not to make his mistake in a self-written obituary published Saturday. The suburban Albany resident died Feb. 13, about three months after he was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer.   Turner's daughter Sarah Huiest says he smoked most of his life. She says her father knew it was a bad habit, but he couldn't give it up.    Turner said in the obituary that he was “an idiot who made the same stupid decision, day after day.”    The obituary says to remember “life is good — don't let it go up in smoke.”      https://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny-metro-lung-cancer-victim-20190220-story.html           RIP, Geoff Turner
    Every time I read something like this, I wonder how much the person wishes he or she would have quit long ago when they got that nagging voice we have ALL heard in our minds saying, "This habit needs to stop."       Like, "Well, I will quit someday, but it is so hard!"   I wonder if it would be even harder to find out you have lung cancer.       For the other quitters here, I say really be thankful you found the strength to stop the habit before it stopped you.       One just HAS to tell the cigarette, "Good bye you -----ing G.D. worthless piece of life-ending ----.
The below is a repost of a repost of a repost... It is a post that I have found invaluable. I posted it somewhere else today - and LB suggested it have a thread of its own.... Triggers: Reminders From Your Executive Assistant Original post : Kattatonic Gold/ Freedom member. "It's all in your head" has developed a really bad rap in our culture. What's up with that? The power of the brain is remarkable. We should marvel and be impressed. Has anyone told you that since physical withdrawal is over... get a grip... or get over it... or something like that? What about patience with yourself? You've been informed that it's psychological after 2 weeks . Do you think the impulse to smoke should stop now, now, now? Do you think impulses after you have quit for a while indicate you are weak? Quite the contrary, actually. Your brain is working as designed. Okay, listen up. Your brain is amazing. Every time you do anything, one function your brain performs is to try to save you time and prevent you from repeating past mistakes. So quickly and subconsciously, your brain scans the memory banks for similar circumstances whenever you do anything. When it finds comparable history, it compares that with what you are doing now and alerts you to differences, just like an efficient little assistant. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yesterday I pulled on my day pack, went out the front door and turned left to walk up the street. Suddenly I am hit with a trigger. Why? Because I haven't turned left off my front stoop since before I quit. I quit in the winter and I have either gone out the back door to my car, or turned right to walk to the subway. Turning left means I am going to bother to walk to the grocery, which I haven't done since I quit. The part of my brain that tries to save me time, let's call him the Executive Assistant (the EA), recalled past left turns from the stoop. He went down a checklist. What did she need / what did she use on previous excursions like this? Wallet? Check. Keys? Check. Bags? Check. Smokes? NOPE. "Ah, ah, ah, excuse me!" I could imagine him running up behind me yesterday as I set out and picked up pace. "You've forgotten your cigarettes! You're going to need your cigarettes when you get to the café!" (I treat myself to a special coffee when I bother to walk to the market.) Remember all those times you forgot your cigarettes and kicked yourself? It was such an inconvenience when you were an active using addict. Back then, your reaction went something like this: "Memo to self. Don't forget the cigarettes!" What I'm calling the 'EA' function in your brain monitors these memos. He got the memos and he's acting on them. He got thousands of memos like that! The poor guy is just trying to do his job. So I thanked my EA for trying to save me frustration, reminded him that I no longer smoke and that he should refer to the new Never Take Another Puff memo. After my coffee up the street, I paused to listen to the Let's-Smoke trigger, a little different and a more uncomfortable than the Forgot-Your-Cigarettes trigger. There he was again, but this time trying to get me to actually smoke! What a guy! His reasoning? "You've eaten, walked and coffeed, you're about to shop... you are going to want a smoke before you know it and you'd always rather smoke here than while walking home. Always! Always!" This guy is no dummy. I did in fact send him that memo many, many times. For heavens sake, I smoked for 25 years. The filing cabinets are full of those old memos. How to teach an old dog new tricks? Well the EA in our brains can and does learn new routines all the time. We may learn slower as we age but we do still learn and adapt, especially if we do it consciously. We have to note new memos to ourselves, sometimes several times and we have to be kind to ourselves... or our ‘EAs’. The kinder and calmer you are, the more chance you have of him 'getting it' each time. So what to do in the café? I said to my EA, "Thanks! I appreciate the reminder but you have to look at the newer One = All memo again. I am not going to smoke today or ever. Please remember that coffee time is no longer smoke time." He will get it; I know he will. It will just take a while and a walk through all my various scenarios. He is really very, very good. He learned so well the first time -- I have to give him time to learn the new mandate. Thanks for reading my ramblings. You are doing it,! It is doable! It does get better and it is worth it... wait! Make that, YOU are worth it. Yes, you are.The factor that really shows the addiction is not how hard or how easy it is to quit. What really shows the addiction is how universally easy it is to go back. One puff and the quit can go out the window.UCanQuit
thank you El Bandito :-)
I really like this El B thank you!!
Good read :)
I love that post!  Thank you Bandit!!
This is fantastic. Thanks for sharing EB!

Fantastic post El B thanks for sharing.
This one helped me so much!
This is a good one- it has been 13 days and I still feel like I am missing something when I am walking out the door.  Purse, phone,keys check.. cigarettes -  no I don't smoke.
This is a good one- it has been 13 days and I still feel like I am missing something when I am walking out the door.  Purse, phone,keys check.. cigarettes -  no I don't smoke.Yep. We spend years training our EA and then get frustrated when that training takes more than a couple of weeks to undo...
Hat to read this one again
This was a great read....
Bump for the newbies...Tremendous help to me in the beginning :)

I'm bumping this for the newbies,  and myself..   I got the Christmas decorations out to sort thru this morning and kept fighting the urge to go outside and smoke, then I realized, I haven't done this since I quit... I woke up my E.A. but now that I know thats what it was I can brush it off and get to untangling the lights.. (that I swear I had very neatly put away last year *humph*)

Love you too my favourite cross dresser!! Will read and read again, cheers muchly.
'Atta Girl. I still get surprise cravings...around month celebration time usually.  Just gotta laugh them off really!
Bump for the newbies :)
I love this thread!
Bump for J :) x
Awesome read indeed!
What a fantastic post! Thank you for bumping it so I could see it! 
This post was invaluable to my quit.  Read it and read it again.
As we party tomorrow...don't let the EA take over....
Bumping for our newest members :)
time to bump this nugget :)
Bump for the March babies :)
My EA's being trained to go on Quit Train hunting for something to read...before I go out...to replacegetting ready to go out smoke time. Thanks, my EA liked this.
I would bloody that son of a bitch, if I could catch him.
This post always made it make sense to me. Bump. x
Nice bump QB. 
I adore this post. Thank you Marti for bumping it for me. There's not much more to say - it just makes total sense. And now I'll chuckle with cravings as I picture my EA frowning at my new schedule. 
At this juncture of my quit I am happy to have these thoughts in my head.             My EA seems to be referring to the new material most times.  :D    love it when all parts of me are in harmony.
Bumping this post because it had such a profiled felt on my outlook and it really resonated with me

I appreciate the reminder but you have to look at the newer One = All memo again. I am not going to smoke today or ever. Please remember that coffee time is no longer smoke time."           He will get it; I know he will. It will just take a while and a walk through all my various scenarios. He is really very, very good. He learned so well the first time -- I have to give him time to learn the new mandate.             Thanks for reading my ramblings. You are doing it,! It is doable! It does get better and it is worth it... wait! Make that, YOU are worth it. Yes, you are.The factor that really shows the addiction is not how hard or how easy it is to quit.

    This is an excellent read and comes at a time that I am noticing my brain reminding me of my routine! It isn't a crave, it is my mind doing what it has been trained to do.  So listen up  brain, I don't do that anymore!!!!!  
    Great post, great metaphor. Thank you! 
    I'd like to relate a little story about what happened to me a few years after my quit.      Was a hectic time in the office and had less then a half hour before the next blood-on-the-floor meeting was to take place so I ducked out, went down stairs and out the front of the building to the smoking area to have a smoke.  Got all the way to lobby on the first floor before I realize I'd forgotten my cigs.  Back upstairs and walking into my cubicle (ugh!) and reaching for my bag when the realization struck...I don't smoke.     Hi stress, fast paced, rush hour autopilot and I'm operating in a yester-year's mode without a conscious thought.  I'd triggered and hadn't even realized it.                
    What a brilliant way of looking at it. No personified nicotine devil at work, but just your EA doing its job.  
Very, very good video.   
Wow.   It's so scary how much damage smoking does, and what kind of hold it has over people.Freedom is 1000x better.Freedom is possible for all of us.
That is scary stuff!
Wow.I was strolling around the QTrain archives   looking for something that addressed how great the hold Nicotine Addiction can have on us  and chanced upon this. Mind Blowing. Please quit smoking. Please STAY Quit. Please. Love,S
This is a very good video.  It reminds me of someone I know.

It really has an iron grip. But its breakable!! With persistance and some love you can say goodbye to the cancer sticks for good, trust us.
     
    I remembered something the other day that I had forgotten for many years    (due to banishing second husband from my mind)  but,    back in the day, we were on an extended canoe trip in The Quetico   and had been towed out through MN's Boundary Waters.    We were planning on a few weeks.    Compass and Map. Spectacular wilderness, Duluth Packs packed with supplies. At the last minute we decided to forgo cigarettes and the flask of Cognac.      After two days, we went berserk from nicotine withdrawal.   We were ignorant about addiction, we just went nuts and furiously paddled back miles and miles and miles and miles.  We were insane.    It was a v. hard paddle for two more days but, we were driven.  By Addiction.   We finally reached The Boundary Waters and found a Lodge.  Bought smokes and got drunk.  We were so crazed. Nicotine does that.     I am so glad I quit.  Everything is better without Nicotine.  Everything    and as a caveat, camping is better with a flask of Cognac.  Snake bite and all that. LOL.

Nicotine does that...                                   Reminds me of the time that me and my father went on a two day canoeing/camping trip.  Dad had plenty of cigarettes but didn’t get the chance to smoke very many.  You see he had never been canoeing on a real river and he steered us right into a tree within five minutes of the start, overturning the canoe and the water ruined his open pack.   And so the day went.  Each time he opened a pack to have a smoke we would hit a rapid shortly after, turn over and have another wet, wasted pack.  Halfway through the day all 3 packs he had brought were ruined.   He bummed some from a buddy when we stopped for lunch and he put them in a ziplock bag to keep them dry.   But comically,  those were lost too, and soon he was offering $5 for a dry cigarette, $10 as the afternoon wore on.   We finally made it to the campground and he was able to smoke (and dry out).  I’ve got a great photo of him at the camp site sitting on a cooler, still wet, his head resting in his hands, looking exhausted     The 2nd day, he put his cigarettes into a plastic jug and tied it to the canoe so it wouldn’t get lost if we turned over.  When he had a moment to smoke, he would open the jug, take out one cigarette and carefully seal the jar back up before lighting up  We did pretty good the 2nd day and only turned over once on a very fast rapid near a short waterfall.  He still didn’t smoke very much though because floating down a river on a small narrow boat requires your constant attention and work     We never went on another canoe trip.  I always wondered if it was because he knew he wouldn’t be able to smoke as much or it was just too physically exhausting for him.  Still, for me, very fond memories, as well as two days worth of great stories, we weren’t the only amateur river rafters/canoers there             Edited February 20 by Wayne045
What a great story, @Wayne045 !     If addiction wasn't so deadly dangerous, it would be splendid comedy fodder.    What an idiot I was.     Edited February 20 by Sazerac
I haven't been around that much but I was here yesterday and was glad to see all of the long quits. I haven't written in a few years but would like to post a few thoughts about the quit process.      Looking at the new and young quits, and the never-ending fight to gain a foothold on the sticky quit, I just wanted to let the newer quits I see on the QT know, that you'll get there too, by sticking to your plan and what you will learn as you stay quit.      This is only a mind game, where your self control is being tested constantly. It wears on you as you overcome the triggering of craves through attrition, trying to process them simply as your mind/body healing itself naturally through recognition and reaction. That someting so elementary is so taxing is hard to understand sometimes.      It really requires no action other than acknowledgement of the particular craving and the processing of it.     Repetition is the key. The first triggers and craves that you will defeat are the ones you encounter the most. The most infrequent ones are the last to fall, and they do, through repetition.      If you will just keep doing your normal daily and nightly activities sans the nicotine delivery, eventually you'll roll over the addiction and leave it behind. Sounds overly simplistic reading this but remember that you will trigger and crave and try to understand what caused it. Don't be alarmed and dont make a hasty judgement, because sometimes you can't put your finger on the particular cause to your effect.      Could be romancing the cigarette subconsciously and missing that old smoky life, since things have changed and you don't know who you are sometimes. I mean you were this... smoker... and now maybe scared and are wanting to go back to what you see as normal. That is when you get tough and remember that you control your own mind and heart and that you call the shots. It's okay to feel weak, but know that you didn't get this way in a few days so it will take a few months of honest work to get out of the hole.     You will make it, even if you feel like you won't. This will not kill you but it will make you unbelievably strong if you'll just stick to your quit plan and your back up plan, and allow yourself some time to heal.      So be militant anti smoking, and  remember that you are in a fight and that you are unwinding your whole being from the addiction so walk like it and act like it.      Once smoking and cigarettes were every part of you, and now...well now they are not. That hurts and that is painful, but it is the work you have to do, so let the process work. Pay it forward, and stay as strong as you can as you use what you have learned.        And if you fall, it isn't the end. You start again. A dream becomes a wish, and that wish becomes your reality as you work the quit. Time is on your side now, so dont give that addiction any more of you. You're in control of your mind and body and you've taken the chains off. Don't put them back on.        KTQ,     Edited October 29, 2018 by MarkusTypos

    Brilliant as ever post....  Good to see you back on board ....
    Great read Markus, and yes you surely know your way around a quit, so thanks for the wonderful advice, and congratulations on a decade of sticking up for your health and well-being. Thanks for the inspiration as well.
    It is great to read your words again, Markus.   You were a profound influence on my quit and it is great to have the opportunity to express my gratitude    and see your positive effect on even more quitters.  
Hi Markus,      It is great to see you again, I remember you from QSMB.     This is a really good post, because it explains to the reader that nicotine addiction has no intelligence. It is primitive, and not the 10 meter tall monster so many people think it is.       We have intelligence, and we can learn.         Quote                                   Repetition is the key. The first triggers and craves that you will defeat are the ones you encounter the most. The most infrequent ones are the last to fall, and they do, through repetition.                                      If you will just keep doing your normal daily and nightly activities sans the nicotine delivery, eventually you'll roll over the addiction and leave it behind.                                 This is wonderful !!!           Cristóbal
Thanks all for paying it forward because thats really important to cement that quit.The years roll up under you. It only drags on for a short time. I actually forgot my quit date, I thought it was Feb 11 but I got it straight now and was reading Divers 5 year, apparently she missed it (Jen).    This only proves that quitting causes absent mindedness in some people. Seriously though we retrain ourselves as Cristobal just mentioned, and are always retraining until we address every single trigger. I love that ancient post from the qsmb, I think its called "My Personal Assistant". It really is an accurate depiction of the human brain processing life after quitting and how it keeps track of what you have addressed or not with regard to triggers.      You don't have to be strong, just learn to roll with it and it's yours. It's just a mind game.      KTQ

OK so first, my biggest trigger for wanting a smoke is excitement. Well like last night my room mate cooked up an awesome dinner with rice and chicken breast. After eating and feeling stuffed, I thought "Holy crap that was delicious! Time for a cigarette! Eh crap, I don't smoke and ain't got no tobacco anyways".   I do not get excited often but when i do, that is when I feel this weird "nudge" to want a smoke. But not enough to give in.    Maybe I found an awesome deal on ebay. Whatever.        But many people say stress is their big one. Well, no matter our age or whatever, stress is always about. Like at my boring job, sometimes I will be working and thinking of things that piss me off. Something that happened 30 years ago, something that I merely imagined, or whatever. So I will be basking in violent thoughts about people I cannot stand. Very stressful but never once during my hateful fantasies or memories do I think, "I want to smoke".       As we age, stress is more common in life than excitement. Unless you drive a Pontiac. OK stupid joke.   But yeah since life is mostly drudgery and stress, which trigger many smokers to light up, how does anyone manage to lay off?       Side note - my room mate drives a Pontiac. It has  a gas leak. So even if one of us did smoke we could not do it around the car cause it might explode. THAT would be hilarious.
    I used to be an equal opportunity smoker...loved me a good old woohoo smoke but chain smoked when stressed... How did I do it... by realising that having a smoke was not going to cure me, get me a new job, pay the bills, put food on the table, erase my past hurts, comfort me, answer any of my questions.....and have the boys and girls here to remind me of all that when I needed it.     Actually, learning that instead of helping with stress smoking would increase it and understanding the neurological connection between nicotine addiction and anxiety helped me learn to cope with stressful times without putting something iny mouth and burning it....I will confess when I get super stressed now I will reach for a chewy (non-nrt of course) or I'll suck a mint ... But for the most it is just life and the one thing I know for a fact that will not help any situation is a smoke.        It was also having threads like this to read in the early days that made me realise that it wouldn't help and why, so thanks @Jet Black for starting such a good thread.         
    I used to smoke for any reason...Happy ,Sad,Stressed ,Not stressed ...I just Smoked ...because I was a lady smoker who deserved a little treat no matter what was going on ...  I woke up and  smelt the coffee.....No you Idiot your a Addict who needs her fix ....   I now deal with life's up and downs much calmer ...I'm not wound up like a spring ..    Stress can be hard enough without nicotine withdrawal to boot ....  The longer the quit ..the more relaxed you become ....
One of the main tenets of nicotine addiction is the fact that smoking causes stress, much more stress and anxiety.   Here are some resourcesSmoking and Mental HealthExplaining The Stress Inducing Effects of Nicotine To Cigarette Smokersandfrom our friend, Joel             Quitting smoking has taught me how to educate myself about a problem, change my attitude and change my life.If I am encountering too much stress,  I see that as a choice and a challenge to mitigate it.   My life has far more excitement than stress and I am Sixty Three. It is all about one's frame of mind and the choices one makes.There is often the promise of a great adventure right around the cornerall of which makes for an interesting life, for sure.    Drudgery and stress ?Not for me, sugar,I had enough of that as an active nicotine addict !  Edited February 13 by Sazerac
    Stress doesn't trigger a crave.         Stress is just an excuse that you will latch onto.  EZPZ
    The cravings/triggers are starting to become just a dull roar now for me 'most of the time'. Now and again a 'moment' crave or a 'stress' trigger will still grab my attention a little more. I don't really understand why some of them will stand out or become something I have to 'fight off'.      Either way the tactics and strategies that I have used since I started my quit, get me though all the moments. Take a breath........address what is really going on "I want to smoke because I used to be addicted to smoking - now I don't smoke"..........distract myself from the moment 'grab a guitar and play a few licks'.       Peace       Rory
    Well friends, I have become one of them. One of what you ask? One of those folks about to rant about smokers :-)     I took a quick little trip down to the Dominican Republic where I got to take in some vitamin sea (see what I did there :-)). I walked a ton, and checked out as much of the local fare as I could. I was astonished that while eating supper there were people smoking at the tables all around me. While I was playing guitar a couple of nights at local bars, people were smoking two feet away from me. Imagine, while I was trying to entertain these wonderful folks, there was a grey haze three feet from the ceiling.     Everywhere I went, the beach, the bars, the pool, the ....... everywhere were people smoking three to five cigarettes an hour. It was overwhelming. Not in the way of "wow do I need a smoke', it was more like 'I'm dying a little every time I breathe.   For nearly a week after my little adventure, I felt that I was trying to soft cough up something in my lungs that I hadn't experienced in a long while.     I'm taking this as a hugely positive experience. I played (guitar and sang) at two bars while I was in the Dominican and I had a blast. I enjoyed the local people, the beaches and bars, and all the expats that I got to meet. I also didn't smoke. Not a single puff. Not only that, but I didn't obsess about smoking at any point. All the smokers around me, and all the smoking triggers and situations, yet it wasn't an issue for more than a fleeting moment.     My journey continues and I appreciate the friendship and support all you folks offer    Peace   Rory        
    Great news, Rory !  So glad you were able to enjoy yourself, even in a cloud of second hand poison. So glad you did not feel temptation.    Congratulations on your One Year and One Day of Freedom !
Thanks for the update Rory! It's great to hear about how rock solid that quit has become after 1 year off the smokes. It's even better that you can share that with others who are early in their quits or just thinking about quitting. It's too bad you had to endure the conditions you did in the clubs or bars you played at but good to know you now look at those situations in a completely different light than what you used to
    What a great update to your awesome smoke free life. Sucks there's so many smokers there still but what a testament to your commitment to be an ex smoker! Come to California next time. You won't have to worry about playing and singing in a smoky club

Risking to come across as a raging Newborn Quitter... but heck, what an amazing load of bs goes around about quitting! 'It takes multiple tries to quit and that's ok!, 'Nicotine calms you down!' (Yes!! When you inhale that shit, AFTER you once started! It's like... an addiction  duhhh!! Otherwise it does nothing for you!). You were born without it, ffs. This sentence, quote website NiQuitin -> 'Als je een regelmatige roker bent, is de kans groot dat het missen van je regelmatige shot nicotine leidt tot een sterk verlangen naar een sigaret.' Translates to, 'if you are regular smoker, there's a good chance that missing out on your regular shot of nicotine leads to a strong desire for a cigaret'. Wait, what..? Isn't that the whole fckn point? Seriously, who do they think they are adressing,  toddlers? This is what makes it an addiction! Besides,  'a good chance..' implicates there's room for doubt, for dreaming about being able to control the yearning. I did that for years and it made me totally hopeless.   It's crazy how much of this so called information gives a consistent message of how hard it is to quit, how understandable it is to fail, how it's basically ok to be a helpless victim, or even in the case of many vaping websites, to be proud to belong to this new generation of 'aware vapers'.... more enslaved than ever.   I remember earlier in my quit people said, be mad. Understand what's happening, how they do it, educate yourself and be angry! I think this is that. What you were talking about. It's crazy. I can't unsee it anymore. I don't need that shit in my body, I don't need it to poison my mind. The nicotine business, whether it's cigarettes, vaping, chewing, gum or you name it, that business is sick to it's core. There's people making zillions out of it and I walked straight in line...        Never, never ever again.     Edited February 9 by MLMR
    Love this M....Great Post !!!
    Why are you angry?  I thought we were supposed to be angry at tobacco companies so why you so angry at people that are just trying to help others quit?  It might sound like BS to you but if it's helping someone else quit then surely that's a good thing.       Millions of people quit smoking every day and they are doing it with that so called BS advice.      It's great that you're however many months quit but don't knock what makes help others.         Its all education - however it's put. 
I think you have missed the point, @Lilly.   There is a lot of misinformation out there with regards to quitting.One that incensed me was that cold turkey is too hard.  Here is an excerpt from my POST, June 13, 2016"I quit almost three years ago   and have become an advocate of Cold Turkeybut, believe me,I support and encourage everybody in their precious quits.    Any Quit Is A Good Quit  I thought to gather some new information(in a galaxy of  Misinformation)   and was dismayed after googling around  finding numerous instances of 'responsible experts' recommending to  NOT quit cold turkey.   What kind of idiotic advise is that ?  Is this more Big Tobacco poisoning minds ?  Big Drug companies pushing product ?    Ignorance ?Today, I found a great rap about this from our Friend, Joel Spitzer   Edited February 9 by Sazerac
    Right we know I used NRT... Pretty sure noone missed that memo but that said I agree with the girls and I totally get why mlmr is angry. Saz hit the nail on the thread.... The info out there on a lot of places you look is the cold turkey is too hard and doomed to fail...I call bullshit.... It most certainly isn't too hard...look how many ct quitters we have here...it certainly isn't doomed to fail look at how many ct quitters we have here who are years in.... I'm the first to arch up and defend NRT and NRT quitters if I needs be....but mlmr wasn't posting that NRT is bad or pointless she was bemoaning the hypocracy of the misinformation issued by NRT providers to ensure they get business...misinformation that is basically bald faced lies.... That's worth being angry over.
    I haven't missed her point everyone, I just don't agree with it. 
    The thing I read throughout your post MLMR is that mentally you have turned the corner on smoking. I have been reading that in your posts for the past little while and that's a great thing that you finally "get it"! Getting mad at the whole process that enslaved you for so long and everything to do with it is just fine and dandy in my books. Once you have that mindset, it will be almost impossible for you to relapse. That's the great news for you. How you got there matters not. Getting there is key. It's hard to get to this point without some very serious determination and a lot of self examination along the way. You've put in the work, now it's time to reap the rewards       
     @Lilly, so you think there's plenty of solid, trustworthy, sensible information available, to aid people in their quits? Since thát was my point and you say you don't agree with it.   @reciprocity, I am starting to get it yes, somehow the past few weeks have been speeding the proces up. Not only am I able to say 'nope' when life does strange and sometimes unexpected things, noping my way through makes everything better, or less sucky if you will. The craves and thoughts about smoking are NOTHING compared to the misery I'd definitely have about smoking through these same unexpected things. The stink, the shame, even keeping a distance from people because I was afraid I smelled. Imagine that, deliberately staying away. That is just sad.    @Sazerac and @notsmokinjo, jep!
    I just think it's naive to think that everything that is said is BS. It may well be to you and plenty of others BUT millions of people quit every day with the help of that so called BS.       People quit years before the internet and they still quit without it. A lot of people quit successfully who attend quit groups and they spout that BS on a weekly basis.        You may not like that BS but it works for some even if not for you. 
    Ah, so you DID miss my point. Ok, end of discussion as far as I'm concerned.

HONOLULU (KHON2) - Hawaii could be the first state in the U.S. to ban the sale of cigarettes, if a current proposal becomes law.    Adults younger than age 30 could be legally prohibited from buying cigarettes in less than a year's time -- and all cigarette sales would be banned in Hawaii in five years -- under a bill by State Representative Richard Creagan. The bill was co-signed by Representatives John Mizuno, also a Democrat, and Cynthia Thielen, a Republican. "We're taxing them, that did decrease use somewhat, but we still have 140,000 people in our state that smoke cigarettes. You don't see them as much anymore, because we kind of made them hide. But, they're going to die, half of them are going to die if they keep smoking, and we can prevent that."    Creagan dismisses the argument that his proposal would take away a smoker's civil liberty, saying it is something the tobacco industry has long cited. KHON2 was unable to reach the American Civil Liberties Union for comment on this story.  Creagan says smokers are horribly addicted and need freedom from enslavement.   Smokers and non-smokers have mixed feelings.    Kenny Tsai says, "I don't think it's a good idea. It's taking away our rights to choose. That's what I think."  Frank Raken says, "Even tho like it's 21, you have to be 21, there is still kind of places that you can actually get cigarettes or, you know, how they ask someone to buy for them. It's gonna be a good idea." Vickson Victor enjoys smoking and says, "It's my right. It's my life. So, it's my choice."  State Representative Richard Creagan is a retired emergency room physician, who believes that from his Capitol office, he can save more lives.  In addition to smokers' addiction, Creagan says the state also is addicted -- to 110-million dollars in annual, cigarette-tax revenue. While Creagan would prefer the ban be immediate and total, he realizes beneficiaries of those tax dollars, the UH Cancer Research Center and John A. Burns School of Medicine, can't go cold-turkey. That is why the ban would be unrolled in phases.    Creagan believes, if Hawaii becomes the first cigarette-free destination, visitors will flock here. "Our beaches will be free of cigarette butts, our parks, all of that. Kids won't be exposed. You won't have to worry about your baby or your dog chewing on a cigarette butt, I mean, we'll be the first state to be cigarette-free and i think that's really cool."    Hawaii was first to raise the legal smoking age to 21 and with the proposed ban, he believes the state should continue to be a beacon for the rest of the nation.            https://www.kron4.com/news/national/hawaii-could-be-first-in-us-to-ban-sale-of-cigarettes/1745301619
I have predicted this for some time, though I thought it would be a country rather than a US state.  The smoking = freedom argument has been one of the most effective and persuasive ones advanced by tobacco companies and their allies, and I am pleased to see a respected entity simply refuse to accept this absurd association.  ultimately, abolition is the solution, and this scaled approach is precisely the way to achieve it.         Christian99 17 Years Quit

    I don't think the solution is to make smokers into criminals.   You will just repeat the prohibition era. (US)      I would prefer that smoking just fade away on it's own through people quitting or not even starting.   It was well on it's way until the e-cig/vape thing came along.

(1) This is not The State's place - despite what folks think, this is a giant leap of overstepping bounds. Then again, The Sarge thinks same for banning of all drugs. Not government's place.  (B) Did no one learn a thing during Prohibition?

    Better ways to help people than to outlaw things. 
Creagan said taxes and other regulations have slowed down tobacco use, but have not stopped the problem.    "Basically, we essentially have a group who are heavily addicted — in my view enslaved by a ridiculously bad industry, which has enslaved them by designing a cigarette that is highly addictive, knowing that it highly lethal. And, it is," Creagan said. Creagan said he started smoking as a teenager and did so regularly during his medical residency. The state is obligated to "protect the public's health," he said.  "This is more lethal, more dangerous than any prescription drug, and it is more addicting," Creagan said. "In my view, you are taking people who are enslaved from a horrific addiction, and freeing people from horrific enslavement. We, as legislators, have a duty to do things to save people's lives. If we don't ban cigarettes, we are killing people.              Nobody likes to be told what to do and if they aren't asking for help leave them alone.         My views have changed after what i have seen, my mother was quit 9 years and the ending which was a result from smoking that started slowly over the years and boom. You can lead a horse to water ...      I was actually smoking watching the deterioration and like the addict i am i couldn't stop, if they were illegal i would've found a way to get them. Now after what i experienced i will do whatever it takes to never puff again. Ban em, educate them..  But help them        I remember back in HS a friend who could never be wrong about sports. I would remind him and this guy told me... Don't do that, give him this number.... You see the "type" that will make you money! Tell him he has a nice shirt while you're taking his $ that he willingly throws away ... I just looked at him and didn't understand it fully back thenEdited February 8 by Whispers

Those who argue that cigarette smoking is a form of freedom (or that smoking bans restrict freedom) are, unfortunately, arguing in favor of their victimization precisely in the way that the billions of tobacco marketing $$$ have hoped.  And the libertarian argument that the government shouldn't be involved in regulating/prohibiting substances is an interesting one; however, in order to use it in this case, you'd also need to allow, then, that things like methamphetamine and heroin should be decriminalized and readily available as well.  You're comfortable with that?        Commercial tobacco is a product unlike almost any other:  it is purposefully designed for maximum addictiveness, and normal use of it leads to death.  Hence, extraordinary remedies--e.g,, eliminating the product in a scaled way from the marketplace--are needed.       Christian99 17 Years Quit

    I don't think anyone should be banning cigarettes anywhere.         What did make me laugh the most about this is that cigars, chewing tobacco and .....wait for it....e-cigarettes won't be banned.

Gday    I don’t know about banned... easy word to shoot off.    I do know that tabocco is no longer grown in Australia, no longer lisenced. Not banned. There were lisences, it was in the interest of big tabacco companies to controll things. Now no licences are issued to grow in the country so nicotine produces are imported.   It is illegal to sell snuff chewing tobacco and vaping nicotine. That’s sell. Not import for your private consumption. So no “rights” apart from those of big tabacco are taken away.   Meanwhile the big tabacco still have the right to import in cigs and tobacco and cigars. Regulated and taxed heaps. Smoking has declined from over 50 per cent to under 15 per cent. I’m betting the next figures will be under 12 per cent here hoping for that magic 10 per cent.     In my lifetime too. So it’s pretty exciting to think it’s actually possible to stop the wholesale sale of smoking in the country.   ChrisEdited February 8 by CbdaveSpeeling

I used to work some gas station. Occasionally, this guy came in who drove some Subaru with a loud stinky exhaust leak, he toted around an oxygen tank, AND he smoked non-filter cigarettes. One time I said, "you know, this is not a good combination" and he said something about how he was a sick man.  How does someone survive for more than a week like that?        On a different note, we also had this one lady come in who was professional looking like the boss at an office job, her legs were one mile long. No, really, they were 5,280 feet long. Holy **** just the sight made me want to smoke.. anyways I thought, "OK, this woman is TOO hot to be smoking cigarettes". One of those you just wouldn't expect to be a smoker. I thought that of myself when psyching up to quit. Like look in the mirror and think "Bitch you are TOO hot to be inhaling whatever is in cigarettes."      But yeah, who the hell carries oxygen around and still smokes? /even if the CANNOT quit, couldn't they just switch to chewing tobacco and maybe not create a fire hazard?
    My mum tried to smoke with oxygen. It shows how much of a grip this addiction has. Even when you know you're dying you still want to smoke 
Ten and a half years ago, my 42 year old brother died of lung cancer.  He smoked until he lost consciousness for the final time--and even then, for some time after, he continued making unconscious smoking gestures.  His inability to quit after his diagnosis and through his treatment was a source of profound pain and shame for him, making his impending and actual death even more difficult and frightening for him.  His wife took her own life a few hours after he died, underscoring and adding to the tragedy.      Smoking kills.      I quit for a better life; just as (and perhaps more) importantly, I quit for a better death.        Christian99 17+ Years Quit
Thank you so much for sharing that @Christian99 .. I know you have shared it before, but every time I read it is like a bucket of cold water to the face and the reminder I need to protect my quit come what may. I know I am not the only person who reads this and says "That wont be me" and by sharing your tragedy all around the world your brother & his wives lives and deaths are being given new worth. Thank you again for sharing such a hard memory to carry.
Thank you for sharing @Christian99....I'm so sorry for your losses....  I too lost my dear friend last year ....taking her last cigarette hours before she passed away ...it was sad to watch ...and sad because she thought she couldn't quit ...  I am thankful every day I found the strength to fight this Demon ....   Reading your post was a good reminder to Never Take Another Puff ....
Choice is our freedom.  We choose everyday for so many things,How do you want your coffee,what are you going to wear, what's to eat ? Little did I realize that for 40 some odd smoking years, I choose slavery.You couldn't have told me...it was my choice and I didn't even consider slavery or addiction.  Smoking was just who I was.I didn't care what y'all said or thought about me. Looking back now, I was a perfect Slave.  An excellent addict. You could show me all the scary movies...tell me all the truth about Big Tobacco,I didn't give a hoot.I had enough money to buy another pack of smokes at the corner storeand I made sure I was Never without.  Ever. I probably still have a carton up in my attic with a fire ax, in case of another Katrina. No, that's not true.I was just up in my attic today,  checking on things.There are medical emergency supplies and a fire ax. There are NO cigarettes. You know why ?I threw them out when I had no further use for them,when I stopped being a Slave. Choice... choose well.You have a beautiful Life to consider.
    More and more, I appreciate Freedom from nicotine.  Nicotine and the chemicals in cigarettes was far more invasive than I ever dreamed.     The empowerment, the commitment to personal truth has also been cathartic and transforming. I am a much kinder and trusting person to myself.  I have genuine compassion.   I don't deny the truth out of hand because I am an addict anymore   and this has led to a metamorphosis in how I greet the world.       Frankly, quitting smoking was the best decision I ever made in my life, bar none.
    Yes Saz, your compassion  and kindness for my "dilemma" throughout the past couple of weeks were a bright light in the darkness I was experiencing.         You can speak a hard truth for one who is on the cusp of hearing, yet speak that hard truth with kindness and compassion.        
    Very well put, Saz. You perfectly described what I was experiencing too: conviction that I smoke because I enjoy it and can stop any moment, and it’s harmful, yes, but I can stop so it doesn’t concern me. I can’t believe how blind I was. 
    Well put and I ask myself every day “ what was I soo damn scared of?!?” It was not as painful as I thought 
    I quit and failed so many times that I became convinced that I was also a hopeless addict who would forever be a smoker. Thank goodness to be free of that kind of slavery. At first it was just noping my way through each day, or sometimes it was moment by moment at thebeginning. quitting is tough but it is not impossibly difficult. I'm on some lung cancer message boards and sometimes read stories about patients smoking until their literal last breath when they simply could hold a cig or inhale anymore. At least I won't go out a smoker.
    freedom is delicious
Was up and about last night, suddenly remembering the endless conversations with myself...      Id forgot how I would be terribly awake at night , debating whether I would smoke outside or maybe in the kitchen. I forgot how I lay awake and then almost always ended up smoking inside the house, regretting the smell immediately. I forgot how often I thought, you know what, let's finish that bottle of wine now im at it. And ofcourse that meant another two cigarettes. I didn't want ashtray smell the next morning so I used the sink. Then id go back to bed, racing heart, foul stinky breath and smoke smell under the blankets, short of breath, coughing. Oh, so ready for sleep! Which often didn't come anyway.. so... I went out of bed again... *repeat*     Junkie thinking is popping up like crazy these days. Nothing I can't handle, but pretty annoying nonetheless. Forcing myself to think back at all the things I hated about smoking really helps.        What are some of the nuisances you forgot about...?  Edited February 7 by MLMR
    Emptying ashtrays.  I probably had five ashtrays in the house, one in the garage, and one on the deck.  It seems as if I was always emptying them.  I know I started a fire in the trashcan at least once.  Now I find other things to do.          The junkie thinking will leave you soon MLMR, come back and tell us about it when it does.
Running out of smokes, stores closed.   Frantically tearing through jackets, bags, purses, drawers, the trash for a smoke.  One night,  after hunting under and behind all the furniture,  I moved the refrigerator.    Look !  A snipe !   A disgusting snipe. Yellow with stains, so poisonous even the stray mouse wouldn't eat it.  I smoked it and felt much better.   Gah.    I smoked a lot of dog ends in my day.    Edited February 7 by Sazerac
The whole damn process! And, it was a daily process. Each and every day, 365 days a year.       Getting dressed 1st thing each morning and getting outside to have that precious 1st smoke of the day. That 1st smoke was like my anti-nope. It was a confirmation to myself that I was still a happy and compliant nicotine addict.That 1st one started the whole daily process all over again each day.       I no longer plan each day's activities around making sure there's a time and place to smoke. I no longer try to limit or avoid life's activities where I can't smoke for a long period of time. There's so many more things that I used to think about that don't even cross my mind any longer. So nice to be in charge of my life again instead of enslaved by an addiction. Of course, we don't see it that way as smokers - true junkie thinking!
    Always worried I would run out ....my whole day was planned by cigarettes...asking myself the junkie questions ..   Have I got enough to see me  through until I go out tomorrow...if not ....cutting down to make sure I have ...and spending time craving and willing the time to pass so  I could have my next precious smoke .. Do I miss that ....Not a chance ...

    Smoking in the rain.    Cleaning wet ashtrays.  Having to pause every movie at least twice so I could go outside and get my fix.    Panicking when discovering I didn't have enough cigs to get me through the next morning. (I live in the country, so a quick trip to the store late at night is out of the question.)    Packing my purse full of gum, perfume, and hand lotion all to try to hide the smell.    Restless legs (nicotine withdrawal exacerbates Restless Legs Syndrome.) Never fully enjoying a visit with a friend or loved one, bbecause I was always anxious to leave and go smoke.   Coughing. All the time.     Sooooooo many nuisances!

Man I just barely survived yesyerday, the craving was almost fatal feeling.  Heavy chest, panic feeling, glom and dome !    Seems come April 5th I will be in the company of the unemployeed in California, turning 60 This month it really sent me spirolling out of control.  Yesterday after waking up and finding out it was not a bad dream the stress started to build.   Up dating my resume, filling out Apps,  searching and the gloom continued to build, the want and NEED for a smoke was growwing. It got so bad at one point I remembered where a 10 dollar cigar was !  All sealed in its glass Tube as fresh as the day it was rolled.  Baby, BABy ! I called and my wife came into the room,  There is a cigar on My rifle rack go get it crush it and toss it in the Garbage Please,  and without a word she complied.  Thank you LORD Thank you. Well it was not all bad news yesterday, I received a call about one of the Apps I filled out, a Interview ! YES !  Thats what I needed, I need to be reafirmed that I was still a marketable Item, That My Trade skills, knowledge and training were still a vital asset.   So the first Interview is set for Tuesday 10am,  now the research starts.

Quitting Smoking is Easy . . .          Easier than hearing your doctor say, `I am sorry . . .`         Easier than fighting cancer.            Easier than laying in the hospital having radiation treatment.          Easier than breathing through tubes up your nose.           Easier than having a Tracheostomy.

    Hi Peter, love this post..
    Great post, Peter.

I know quitting smoking is far easier than living with perpetual slavery, slow suicide or gruesome deathbut, quitting actually IS pretty easy.Sure, it took me about a year to navigate my way through de-tox, craves, and triggersbut, that is short time considering the 40 something years I spent establishing my addiction.The body heals so quickly, the mind shifts to a new consciousness.   I'm not saying it was a cakewalk into town,it took determination and focus,  sometimes it took ALL I had but, it wasn't THAT hard.  I  beat every damn crave.It didn't hurt and the rewards came fast and furious.  I am not making light of the struggle although retrospect is forgiving and kind.Still, even while in the thick of it, I knew it was temporary.I knew I was going to succeed.  I never gave myself an opportunity to fail.
Vaping is dangerous not only on the long term, but immediately.https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/02/05/vape-pen-kills-man-after-exploding-his-mouth/?utm_term=.9d3bc18ed0a3
That guy doesn't even look like he needed any more chemicals of any kind.       Also, even if vaping is supposedly not as harmful as cigarettes, at least cigarettes do not randomly explode. if the cherry drops off you can at least put it out before it starts a real fire.Edited February 6 by Jet Black
G’day   I’m cbdave and more often that not I get to raise the NOPE pledge of a morning. Being close to the international date line and living on the east coast of Australia means that I get to see the new day a lot earlier than most.   If I’m off fishing it can be really early as I hate my phone smelling of fish bait. It wasn’t always that way. I never posted a NOPE on the QSMB board in those first months. I thought it was a tad daggy. Couldn’t see the sense in it, if I smoked it was my fault it wasn’t needed to keep me honest.   Had a bit of a rethink about the three month mark as I had two quit killers coming up.  First a wedding with old friends who smoked and drinks... normally a recipes for smoking if every there was.    On my return a biopsy for cancer. Sobering. So I started to post to keep myself in touch with the board and more importantly as an acknowledgement that Yes I was really an Addict. It really hit home that I needed to fess I that I was only a puff away from going back to that standard 20 cigs a day!   So that’s me, now a diferent board ....but still taking the time to acknowledge the addict in me.... if only once a day.   So pledge or don’t pledge but never forget what it stands for   Not One Puff Ever   ChrisEdited February 4 by Cbdave
    I was more religious about pledging daily the first year or so because it just helped me focus for a moment on what the most important thing was that I had to do, or not do in this case. It worked for me.
I lurked for the first 10 months of my quit but, committed to NOPE. It was a big part of tearing down my denial and admitting I was an addict.  I would holler, NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE ! and FREE YOUR HEAD ! over and over and over.     When I joined, I jumped right in with the NOPE  and have only taken a few hiatus' from it.  There is a bonding, a feeling of camaraderie with everybody,  also often great eye candy optics !   Throwing the 'likes' around is a nice heads up, 'I'm glad you quit' hit of support for quits of any duration.       I love seeing 'tomorrow'  today what with the time differential, @Cbdave    It is always good to know that 'tomorrow' arrived intact    and brings this song to mind,    Edited February 4 by Sazerac
I am a junky... and a superstitious one at that...I seem to bounce from one addiction to another... so when I first joined QSMB I did not nope... ever.... there was no way I could pledge NOPE... not one puff ever... I mean I wasn't sure if I was going to last another day let alone forever.... how could I pledge I would take not one puff ever... I think I typed a nope for about 3 weeks before I actually posted one.. and then someone said... I pledge NOPE for today... and I thought, hey I can do that... I can make that pledge... and pretty quick I needed to make that pledge, and I needed to like everyones NOPE ... to acknowledge their pledge had been seen, to let them know they weren't alone... and then my NOPES got bigger and more elaborate and it became so I had to nope that way... It had to be a statement... or it was bad luck, or I would have a tough quit day... and then I became obsessed with it and then some people expressed the fact they didn't like my NOPEs and I became paranoid and the hour it took to prepare them became an hour and a half or two hours because I would panic something I wanted to type would be taken the wrong way or be construed as racism or a million other things it wasn't and offend someone ... it became my new addiction something I had to do or my skin crawled but something that was damaging me to do so I had to break that habit... so now I Nope occasionally... because when it got to the point I was spending an hour a day researching a preparing a NOPE and getting anxiety if I couldn't get it just right I needed to step back. I still say each morning... NOPE I will not smoke today... and finish each day with NOPE, today I did not smoke... I just can't "NOPE" every day because I have issues.Edited February 4 by notsmokinjo
My NOPE was very important to me .....early in my quit ...I knew if I pledged a promise to myself and the board ,I wouldn't smoke that day ...  As time went on ...I was so proud  I rid myself of this terrible addiction after smoking over 5 decades.. I was proud to say NOPE.....  Being part of a group...a team....meant alot to me .... I still pledge now and again ...    I love watching the fun folks get out of it ....ya ...NOPING is powerful....a great tool to have ....
    I love your NOPE's, @notsmokinjo    It is amazing to me how much work you put into them and I appreciate the content and the time spent.    NOPE-ly yours,  S

NOPE-ly yours,          I also like your Nopes.  I think you are a walking encyclopedia!  You really get that brain stimulated and come up with things I would have never thought of.       As far as my Nope, it is very important to me.  It is the last thing I do at night and the first thing I check in the morning so I can "like" all the other nopes.  It kind of feels like my group hug. All those successful quitters standing by me and letting me know they are right there with me.
    G’day   Well I think I got the answers  that I was expecting..... varied. Seems we are all a bit diferent on what NOPE means to us. As long as we all get the thing we all want.... freedom from the smokes...  C
Man what a weekend, Rain major trigger, Driving a major Trigger, Rain and Driving for 1.5 to 2 hours Mega trigger and Then the Trigger of all triggers !Rain and the Superbowl !By the time I had got thru with the Rain and driving I pretty much had a handle on those triggers, Deep brethes to help the heavyness in my lungs stayed in the Fast lane for the want to just jump off and pick up a pack.By the time the Rain and the Superbowl Got here I was petty much prepped for the cravings,  had some project work to Do during the Breaks and Half time, the Wife was there and My Mom was there, and Both do not want to see me smoking again.I can seriously say if you have a hidden pack or even just a smoke get rid of it Now !  what save me and my Quit was the fact I can not smoke what I dont have.These were Major Craves and Triggers,  I was alone, the rain, foggy windows and traffic just eurged me on, flashes of me taking a deep drag and the satisfaction it brought,  This was a serious attack on my Quit, a attack that lasted all weekend On and Off.Thursday and Friday I would have told you I have this down, I am in tottal control, the days of having to worry about this Cravings and triggers were over,Today Monday I tell you I was wrong,  Was I in danger of lossing my Quit, No I don't think so, I still have my Gaurds and Protections in Place, I have not relaxed or dropped any of them.With every Battle such as this weekend that I overcome I grow stronger and the aditions grows weaker, it really used a enormous amount of energy on this one. In fact we both did. the knowledge that I had all you at a buttons notice to come run in and suppot me,  provided me that extra biit of confidence I needed, I still had Ammo, lots of Ammo at my beconed call,  This adiction was not going to win.
    Congratulations on surviving the weekend and keeping your successful quit, Opah !       You must be prepared for a full year of triggers.   Some are seasonal, some come from out of nowhere.   We have a lot of brain receptors to wrench away from the addiction.     While most of these triggers will not be as intense as they are now, while your quit is young,  still some may come out of the blue and really knock you about. All you can do is NOPE your way and watch them fade away.       Please reward yourself for your successful weekend, make a conscious point about this hard won bonus.
    Good job on getting past that brutal weekend opah 
    Way to go O !!!!    Every battle you win...is a step nearer to winning the war !!!!
Kong Hei Fatt Choy.... Happy New Year and blessing for wealth and prosperity.       So you missed joining the Quit Train at new years?.... not let that stop you, it is now Chinese New Year... it is tradition to sweep you house, pushing everything out the door, it is done to sweep the old year out and welcome the new year in. So why not metaphorically sweep out your body, get rid of the smokes and nicotine and welcome the new year as a non-smoker.      Apples and Oranges are eaten during Chinese New Year because their colours bring joy and good luck... but why not stock up as oranges and apples (or even just their juice) will help keep you hydrated and also help to keep your blood sugars up. So clearly this is the perfect time of year to quit.        Also this is the YEAR OF THE PIG (even though our Pig is awol  )..... years of the pig are know to be times of good luck and good fortune... clearly the year of the pig is telling you to give up and make your own luck and your own fortune (all that money you wont be wasting on tobacco)..        So start the Year of the Pig well.... give up and be lucky, and be fortunate.    Edited February 2 by notsmokinjo

    It's about time!!
Had the coolest thing happen last night. I had another smoking dream, but this one went very differently...     Usually in my smoking dreams I'm enjoying the heck out of that cigarette, and I wake up feeling simultaneously very guilty and immensely relieved that I didn't actually smoke. Well, in last night's dream, I was excitedly anticipating that first puff, ready to light up, when I suddenly blurted out the word "NOPE!" I have literally never done that in a smoking dream, not even in the 11 years I was quit before. I just said "NOPE," and bam! I woke up.     I guess my mindset has really changed! That or this place (and the daily pledge) is starting to infiltrate my dreams.       Either way... totally winning!
    Yay abby! That's awesome, looks like your mindset has indeed changed  
    this is excellent news, Abby.   As we sleep, the cilia in our lungs is busy scrubbing itself of tars and nicotine.  This can stimulate our sense of taste and smell and trigger dreams. You have quit smoking !  Looks like your subconscious got the memo ! 
Our lives are often a reflection of the choices we have made along the way. I chose to smoke for decades, to the detriment of my health and wealth. Two years ago I chose to quit smoking mostly to stop the harmful effects of smoking on my health.       Just recently I took the money I saved from not having to buy cigarettes for just this past year and spent that on a Caribbean Cruise and enriched my life by visiting 5 places I had never been to. This was a consequence I got to choose because I had quit smoking. You may choose something different. Doesn't matter. The point is YOU get to choose the consequence - not your addiction!    Didn't hurt that I escaped the bitter cold for a while either. Here's a couple of pics of my trip:          Lounging on the Lido Deck       At the beach in Tobago          Had I chose to continue smoking 2 years ago the best consequence of that choice would have been standing outside in the freezing cold getting my hourly fix.        The worst consequence of that choice might have been this?      Put the choices for your future back in your hands. Choose to quit for good! There are so many benefits from choosing to quit. Temporary discomfort in the beginning is a small price to pay to get back your freedom!
Fantastic!  I smoked my last cigarette 10:30 PM January 5, 2018. I smoked for 37 years. I remember it like it was yesterday. It wasn’t even my brand LOL.  It was one I bummed from my wife because I intentionally left mine at home.  I chose to quit for more reasons than one. Money was one of them. You’re right, a few days of discomfort is well worth the reward.  I chose to purchase some new home entertainment equipment with the money I’ve saved from quitting.  Quitting nicotine is by far, hands-down the most significant thing I’ve ever done for myself in this life.  Cigarettes did nothing for me. They took away my time, my money and my health.
    Fabulous .....  What a Reward for all your hard work ....Quitting is like giving your self a huge pay rise .... It looks Amazing .....
I'm starting to see the weakness of the smoker or the addiction. I had several people that are with the company buying us out come to our facility today. One of the guys asked where the smoking areas were. I told him and he wanted to know if I wanted to join him. Maybe I just look like a smoker...I don't know, but I told  him I was almost 3 months quit. He started to tell me that I had to miss it! I said no...not at this time that I was ready to quit when I did. No way...his wife was trying and was having a terrible time. I told him it was easy...I did it a 1000 times before!!         The whole thing is,  he kept trying to get me to go out and join him. He couldn't take no for an answer. That is BS! I don't want to smoke and he was trying as hard as he could to get me to go out with him. What does it take to be able to just say no? Didn't do it and proud of it. But why push us? To make themselves feel better?      It's hard enough for the most part without being goaded...makes me want to say go  piss up rope! Sorry just saying!!
That's just dumb. I had several occasions in the last 5 months where smokers thought it'd be justifiable for me to smoke one... as if that's their decision anyway. Strange how people want to comfort you with their own crutch. So glad I didn't, by the way.     I remember always feeling a little jealous when a fellow smoker gave up. And... yes, I also was reluctant to believe they could do it. I think mainly to feel a little les shitty about myself. I'm ashamed about it, but I think it's just what addiction does to you.
    Feel sorry for the poor smoker W....    He's still believing all the lies ....he wanted you to go with him....cos he woudnt look such a sap being by himself ...    High five to you ....deep down that smoker  was so envious of you ....this is why he went to great lengths ....

    What a great charge for you to be able to say, 'NO'  and mean it !  Good for YOU !
    Good on you for standing your ground wantsit. Smokers hate losing one of their own, it makes them realize that this addiction isn't impossible to overcome. I'm happy for you

    Unfortunately this is pretty common.  I suppose a group of people making bad choices is easier for us to justify than a single person.  Not that addicts need help with justification!  We are experts!
    I have heard a couple times in the past, "You don't do anything do you?" cause i don't smoke, drink, or use drugs.  It is like, "How old are we?"

    Almost half my life I have spent smoking, sucking and Puffing an polluting my Body, kinda like being in prison I would Think ?
    We were in prison. We weren’t sure of it, but we were on death row. We had seen others killed. The rules requiring a swift and humane execution were not guaranteed. In fact, the torture of slow poison was in motion. What bugged us most was not the prison or even the death sentence, but that the punishment seemed way out of proportion to our crime. It was unfair.    There had been rumors of escape, but even so, our cells were solid brick. They happened somewhere else. We had run at the walls before to no avail. If we escaped, surely we would be recaptured and our imprisonment would be made even more severe. We were comfortable in our cells. It was our choice.  We heard a whisper. It was so soft we could barely hear it. “If you say NOPE and laugh in Spanish like this, jajajajaja, you can walk right through the wall to freedom for ever.” That’s crazy, feel how thick and hard these walls are – there is no way we could walk through them. We’re not strong enough. What’s on the other side anyway? Tomorrow, maybe.   Finally we tried it, and it worked! We ESCAPED! The wall wasn’t solid, it was made of smoke. We passed right through it. We were free. Now we help others when they escape and are blinded by sunshine and overwhelmed by fresh air. And we whisper to those still in prison, “If you say NOPE and laugh in Spanish like this, jajajajaja, you can walk right through the wall to freedom for ever.”

Man 21 days, 3 weeks and headed on to one month,  Man I am so glad I did not take a could of years to get smat and get back off of the Nicotine.    This time with the edjucation, experiance and knowledge I am doing really well,  Knowing what will  I was basically going to go through and being able to perp for it was such a benefit.   I have decided that this time I will not enter No mans Land, insted I will circumvent it, yes that is correct I am going to Navigate myself around No Mans Land.    Yes Yes that will be the Trick, avoid it, Do not allow myself to enter.   I have the tools and Mode of transpertation to accomplish this.  Yes Yes I feel empowered.Edited February 1 by Opah
    Congrats! First month is within reach now, must feel good.      I still count in weeks, it helps me divide the months and therefor every day/week/month is of equal importance and worth mentioning to myself. Building a rock solid quit by doing so.      I think No Mans Land is as true as you make it, so denying yourself entrance seems like a good thing to do   
    I didn't experience No Man's Land.  When the initial 'shine' of my quit wore off    it was replaced by a bigger and  brighter shine of accumulated time.    I was SO happy I had quit and still, five years later, have a deep, confident grin about it.        I was stopped on the street the other day.  'gotta cigarette ?' 'No', I BEAMED. 'I Quit !'  'Congratulations'.  He couldn't help but notice my exuberance, I was a-glow.
    The quite when all fades and life just goes on is what got me last time, it was said and done, felt I was in control and then that one cigar.   then two weks later, hell that was no problem then once a week for no reason at all but to smoke,  I was screwed from that point.   So this time there is not going to be quite, I will make my own noise,  The echos of Opan will rebound off of these walls far and long. When my war is over and it is a scurmish here and there, I will be supporting other quiters in their plight and fight to be nicotine free.  I figure to become a fixture here and in doing so never have to set foot in the quite of the Mans land.  
    Addiction is forever and re-ignited so freakishly easily.   I was almost a year into my quit when that really sunk inLifetime of Addiction
    Ya I had a really hard time excepting  that, in fact I fought hard to keep that avenue open.  
I never entered No Man's Land Either....I was so grateful to be rid of that 52 year addiction...it's about positive attitude....    Keep positive ....don't  allow negative thoughts.........
Well done Opah, that week went quick!!! Well done on 3 weeks
Look at you killing it.. OPA no H! BTW, if you watch deal or no deal ep 12 they have a greek guy on yelling OPA and smashing dishes

Though it has been in my thoughts overwhelmingly, for the past week, I am not smoking.  I have been able to wrap my brain around the fact that this is just a test of my resolve.   My parents are both sick now.  My mom became sick at the beginning of the week and I have been running between her home and the rehab to take care of both.  My dad seems to have given up and was diagnosed with pneumonia.  He has quit eating and I have been trying to make some of his favorites and take it into him but it hasn't helped.                                                                                                       I had been trying to get my mom into the doctor but she would refuse.  I finally took her to the emergency room yesterday and they admitted her.  She is very weak and has RSV and they are concerned about her getting treatments for her lungs.  Sitting in the emergency room, my mother said every cruel thing she could say.  When they decided to admit her, she informed me she would never forgive me.  The doctors encouraged me to leave her because she is very weak and her lungs are full of fluid.  She called last night and said she expected me there this morning because she is signing herself out.  I am up and dressed and ready to go.    You know, I was a great kid.  If I knew my parents would be so difficult in elderly years, I might have given them a little more trouble when I was younger. lol.   I am trying to separate the childhood hurts and realize that their responses are coming out of fear.    I am just venting to keep myself sane.  I know there is nothing you can do to change the circumstance but you are my encouragement for success in quitting.  You all always give me the words to keep me steady on this journey.     Edited January 24 by Linda Thomas
    Hi Linda        Well done for keeping your resolve.     Like quitting Tough love isn't easy but it has to be done.      Stay strong and Tuff.
    Bless you Linda, you can't help how your parents are, they are certainly very lucky to have a daughter like you, who still runs around for them, even though many would,nt. ((hugs) )Stay strong
    I'm really sorry to hear that now your mom is sick too Linda. I'm glad you have us and this board to vent to. Quitting is so hard with no extenuating circumstances and you've proved time and time again just how strong you are. No you will not smoke. You will not give anyone or anything a reason to break your quit. You are my hero and proof that anyone can quit and keep their quit no matter what is thrown at them.    You are in my thoughts and no matter the outcome you will have peace of mind that you did all you could do for your parents in spite of how badly they treated you...xoxo
    Dear friend,    Please do not pick up your mother at the hospital.  If she is capable of signing herself out, she is capable of finding a ride home.    You are not responsible.        I am so glad you are keeping your quit, protecting your quit.   I hope you start protecting yourself too.

Oh Sazerac, why am I so foolish?  Wish you would have gotten to me before I left.    I was there at 7:00 am this morning to get her.  She was so mean, I sat out in the hallway and waited for her.  The nurse even tried to calm her.  I have dropped her with my dad and gone home.  She will have to find her way home.   I do understand that they are scared and afraid of losing control.  What I don't understand is why she does not care that she has a caring daughter.   Oh the saga continues.  The nursing home just called and they are sending my dad back to the hospital because he is sick.  They need me to get his things out of rehab and retrieve my mom because she can not ride in the ambulance to the hospital.
    Hi Linda,   I am sorry you are going through this...you are doing amazing especially by writing here, you got this! Sending you hugs and strength.      c

I am sorry I was four hours too late !  There is no understanding or logic to your parent's behaviour towards you,  it is abominably wrong wrong wrong. Your Mom can scoop up your dad's belongings and get a jitney to the hospital.   But, I bet you are there already, poor thing.   OK, tomorrow is a new day.  Take The Day OFF.  Nurture yourself.    Get a plan together if you can. Draw the line in the sand.

Well I did not go.  The rehab transported my mom to the hospital with my dad.  My husband stopped, on his way home from work, and picked up my dad's belongings.    This actually may be a blessing because my dad is in regular hospital room and my mom will just stay overnight with him.  This way there will be someone in and out of the room and can keep an eye on her.      Have kept in touch with nurses.  My dad does have pneumonia and the nurses feel he will be there for at least three days.   Have contacted my brother, in California, and he is going to come home for a week.  My husband, son and daughter (which is unusual) are all circling the wagon and making sure I get a break.      In the meantime, I am grateful you are there to hear me vent and guide me.  My quit has really been put to the test and so far it is secure!
    I am so glad to hear your family are circling the wagons, Linda.    Please take care of yourself, friend.  Take more Vit C and Zinc to ward off flu/cold or just plain collapse.    Eat well, water water water.    You are under tremendous stress and must take extra care you don't get sick (especially since you are in and out of germ factories).        Your quit is strong.    You are powerful.   We love having you in our corner, that's for sure.
    I am so proud of you for putting Linda first... It is such a hard thing to do when you are a natural carer. Don't waste energy even trying to understand your parents some people just make no sense. What I can tell you is any flaw or fault that causes them to treat you the way they do is their's not your's. To a certain extent we have a responsibility to care for our parents in their dotage however that does not mean we have any obligation to be abused or to put up with such behaviour. If someone kept their hand in a burning flame even though it was causing pain, damage and scars you would think they were crazy there is no reason to leave their hand in the flame...well staying around to cop the emotional wounds is just as silly...which is why I am so proud you said no and stuck to your guns. You vent away beautiful lady...cos we love you just the way you are and we don't take the gift of your support and friendship and caring nature for granted, we rejoice in it.        Right that's it you need a t-shirt that says "I've got big hairy quit balls and when I say NOPE I mean it".....true on so many levels.
    Linda, I don't have wise words for you.. but I admire your courage and I can see that you are making immense choices. And writing it down, giving yourself a voice, is surely one of them.      Take care and let nothing and no one come between you and your precious quit.
    Wow Sweetie ....    I am so proud of you....you have been tested and you didn't fall over ....My hubs can be a hand full ..but your mum ...just  wow!!!!!.....I carnt hug my daughter enough ...    It's great to hear ..you are getting some support at last....Linda Time ....make the most of this help ...  You are in my heart.... Praying some peace for you......xxxxx
    Very proud of you Linda in more ways than one. They are our parents and we have to be there as we can for them now that the shoe is on the other foot.  I know how difficult things can get but hell, it couldn't have always been easy for them. I'm going through issues with my mother now and would have never dreamed this would happen. Ha ...I was always her favorite and now i can't even talk to her, but will do what I have to, to have peace with myself. Super proud of you for keeping the quit, and stay strong there is only room for improvement.

That is the part that keeps me there.  I kind of say I am working on my crown for heaven.  Regardless of who or how my parents are, I would be there.  It is my nature.  I have been that way all my life and have done the same with neighbors and friends.  My youngest brother was the golden child.  Still is and is not there to help.  You and I  will not regret it.  If you ever need to commiserate, message me any time.
    Just a little update.  My dad is still in the hospital but is finally starting to turn a corner for the better.  My mom has spent the entire time at his side.  I actually think she really felt she was losing him this time.  They are making sure he is stable before they send him on to rehab.  My mom has threatened the doctors that she will take my dad home, with paid care, if they want to put him in a nursing home.  I hate to see that too but know that, in my moms world, that would be a disaster.  Between my husband, son and daughter, I have been able to keep a healthier balance of being there.    This has truly been a test of how stress plays that part in smoking.  I have been consumed with the thoughts of sitting and relaxing with that cigarette.  Consumed yes, but acting no!  There is more of me that wants that quit and not that cigarette.  
    Glad your dad is turning the corner for the better Linda. Really glad your hubby and the kids rallied around you during this time.
    Thanks for the update, Linda.   I am so glad you are delegating responsibility and drinking deep from the cup of NOPE !
    Aww ...It sounds like your situation with the family has turned a corner ...good news ....never doubted your quit ....hugs xxx
    I’m glad to hear things are becoming a bit more bearable for you lately Linda. Keep being strong, I know I have found I rarely think of a smoke anymore. it Just doesn’t appeal to me now. That being said, I know what can happen really quick and keep that in the back of my mind. Stress is a major player in this little trip we’re on.        Keep it it up , you are doing great!
On the eve of my 1 year quit anniversary I couldn't help be reflect on what brought me to this point.       I remember 1 year ago today standing beside my car in the cold and damp, subconsciously reaching into the pocket of my coat for a cigarette. Like the thousands of others that had gone before it, I lit that smoke and took my first drag. I had just finished a coughing fit from the bronchitis I had for all of January 2017 and that first drag on the cigarette launched me into another coughing fit. Struggling to even take a breath after that, it finally dawned on me that what I was doing was completely insane!! That was the moment that literally changed my life. I knew I had to quit smoking!       For whatever reason, this event had grabbed my attention. This time it was REAL. I suddenly knew I was no "special flower" who could escape the ugly fate that many years of smoking clearly had in store for me. The next morning at 8:30 AM with no real plan in mind, I had my last cigarette.       The days that followed are a murky blur of what I perceived to be at the time, unwelcome feelings and sensations, as my body purged itself of the drug that had been present on a daily basis for over 4 decades. The highs and lows of that first week or so are indescribable to me now. I wish I had kept a blog of it all. I remember feeling like I wanted to crawl out of my own skin at times the anxiety was so pronounced. And the time ....... God Dammit!! Time was standing still! I was trapped in a never ending series of mental and physical withdrawals.       I was unsure as to what was happening to me. I was even more unsure whether I could weather this storm I was caught up in.      After a week or so of this crazy roller coaster ride, I found this place and signed up. I was welcomed, as all of you have been and was given the first glimmer of hope through the encouragement that others were extending to me. This was good! I started to read and read and read all the pinned posts and a lot of other posts. I watched numerous videos about quitting. This was the perfect distraction for me while my body and mind rebelled against the path I had chosen to take. I was on this site sometimes almost 24/7 it seemed. Sleep patterns were interrupted to say the least so here I was on the site at ungodly hours of my day and night sometimes.       Everything I read from these people who had gone before me sounded the same! It was like a broken record, repeating itself over and over. Pledge your NOPE every day. Take smoking off the table. Watch out for the Nicodemon because he will attack you at your weakest moments and try to lure you back to smoking.  Every battle you do with the Nicodemon, you get stronger and he gets weaker. This all sounded like some sort of cult like lingo to me. Could I take this seriously? Dare I believe them all? I read some more. I read how the people before them had been telling them the same things. I was ultimately convinced and decided that I too had to abide by the same critical rules if I had any hope of being successful. Blind faith had overcome me and I was all in!       From that point onward, I read and read about every phase of my quit. What had others experienced when they were at the stage I was at? 1st month, second through 3rd and fourth months when I was in No Man's Land. What had others experienced and how did they cope? This was what became my guiding light through to the time I finally became aware that I would never smoke again. I would never smoke again by my own free choice because I now knew what smoking really was. It was an addiction. It was my enemy - trying to kill me. It was certainly NOT my friend. And in the end, it's my belief that this is the point one has to reach in order to know you will be permanently quit. You need to be able to gladly choose not to smoke.     So on the eve of my 1 year quit anniversary, I don't feel a lot different than what I felt after probably 5 or 6 months quit but, this 1 year landmark is still a very special one because I have weathered the storm through all the 4 seasons and experienced all the temptations I can imagine and I know that providing I just don't ever put another cigarette in my mouth and light it on fire, I will be permanently quit        I sincerely hope to be still around and able to help each and every one of you newbies celebrate your own 1 year anniversary celebration        (Sorry for the long winded post but ......... I've earned the right to be annoying )             Edited January 29, 2018 by reciprocity

Reciprocity, reading your synopsis of the very moving year of YOUR QUIT has made me a little teary & a lot motivated. You have touched on the many phases of quitting smoking with remarkable sensitivity....I am feeling all of your fears, the stages you conquered, your steps toward freedom, your courage & your resolve to build your life without smoking. What an absolutely wonderful “night before the big day” you have shared. Thank you! I certainly look forward to your being there with the rest of the QT passengers to help Newbies like myself.

A while ago I wrote in my introduction post: 'I know it will take time, I know I want to take that time. And I am still terrified'. 160 days later I know it was worth every shiver.        Back then, all I could think of were things like, how am I going to get through the day? What will be my morning coffee like without a cig? Should I prepare myself for doomsday or will it be a matter of giving in to the proces and go with the flow? And... what if I fail, or worse, what if I succeed but my life will suck for the rest of it? Pretty ingenious stuff, really. How did I make that up!       Then, lots and lots and LOTS of debunking followed: I made it a near dayjob to research and expose every junky thought that crossed my mind. Writing them down, sharing them with this bunch of great people helped tremendously. I am not proud to admit it, but for a long time I found it too scary to cheer on newbies: afraid as I was they would give up on their quit and just disappear.. I felt I needed succes stories to feed on.        There's two major things on my 'surprsing advantages list', that I hoped would happen. It's only been two weeks or so that I dare speak of it out loud... 1. panic attacks don't find me very attractive anymore and 2. chronic underlying depression is crawling away backwards, tail between it's legs. These are huge things, concidering I've been dealing with both for almost as long as I can remember and have been therapying my ass off for at least half my life. As you may notice, I still don't talk about it as if I were super exited. I guess it needs to sink in deeper before my whole being feels safe enough to addept to these changes. But that's ok,  that will happen.         It is possible to go through life events and remain smokefree, even early on. Someone I held dear, passed away. Insanely sad, because it was her (unexpected) own choice. I can't imagine what nightmare her loved ones are going through. It's also a theme that I've been struggeling with twice, around my 20s. (Grateful to be able to speak about it). So, memories and tears on different levels. Biggest trigger came knocking on my door: disconnectedness. But hey, I wouldn't do it the old way anymore right? So, I figured out ways to connect, even if it was calling a friend in the middle of the night and say nothing at all.      And then last weekend, relationship bomb crash tragedy. Something that was bound to happen and kept being postponed by the both of us. I experience pain, relief, fear of lonelyness, a cautious thinking of the future. I know that processing will come in waves... and most likely at least some of the waves will test my willpower. Amidst all this, I have a little glint about keeping my quit. Because really, nobody is taking this away from me. I will fight for it, no matter what. (And I will rise like a godd*mn phoenix, but that sounds so theatrical).        The reason I choose to write these things so openly, is that they happen. They are real, human events and they tell stories of brittleness. Where I live, 1 in 4 people has to deal, at some point in their lives, with mental illness. Thats huge. People lose people and that hurts. There's no pretending about that.        To all newbies and lurkers, do protect what is solely yours. Don't make events or people responsible for lighting up.. find your strength, dig deep or stay shallow and plaugh on if thats what works for you. Please know that this is doable also for you and know that every person here has their story.    I believe our stories shape us, but by quitting we can turn things around: we are shaping our stories.           Edited January 29 by MLMR
    Remarkable writing.
    What a splendid testimonial, M'life.    You have shaped your story in a truthful and accessible way.    Thank you for taking the time to share it with all of us.   We are behind you and beside you.
    MLMR you actually are my hero.  Being able to freely talk about your struggles with mental illness and share it with others is so brave.  There has always been such a stigma associated with mental illness, many of us who deal with the same issues are afraid to talk about it.  Following you story is a true inspiration.  I hope you realize how strong you are and know that you will also be able to weather the decision to end your relationship.   Be patient, pamper yourself and know that the best is yet to come.
    Good post MLMR. Thanks for sharing it.
    A lovely honest  post M...  It's been a pleasure to have been on your journey with us....   Watching you get stronger ,is great to witness...you are a strong lady...I'm so proud of you ...
    Thank you for sharing this MLMR...xoxo
    Fabulous insights, MLMR.....this especially resonated with me "Amidst all this, I have a little glint about keeping my quit. Because really, nobody is taking this away from me. I will fight for it, no matter what."      You are a warrior woman, that is for sure.....so proud of you!
    It never ceases to amaze me how quitting smoking makes us grow so much within ourselves...it's like when the 'smoke' clears there is a new clarity, a new strength and a new awareness not just to what is around us but also what is within us. Thank you so much for sharing your story and your journey with us @MLMR... Be proud of you because you should be.
    That was an outstanding read MLMR. Thank you for sharing and stay true to yourself.
    I have had a couple smoking dreams last week, Now last night i must say the real dreams started, These ar the dreams one can feel the smoke in the lungs and   Taste the tabaco.   This time I was not startled when I woke up, It was AHA I know you.  I am starting to get lazy at times and then a dynamo when something aroses me,   I have been able to contrl most of my emotions, especially the anger and irritability,  Its the suden leak that gushes from my eyes that catch me by surprise and that is when I am ussually alone.  I'll be in my truck in the drive way collecting my stuff and a song that brings the forth the flood.  I wont try to stop it, I figure that it has been a long time since my eyes have been beluged with soft water.   In a couple more weeks the trigger should be mostly disarmed and the cravings should be not much more than dreams.  In this quite place is where I must be digalent, I need to arm my self with mental ammo to combat the soft low guesturing that it is OK now, the you proved you could walk away thoughts, the  you can have one.  Yes in this silence I will need to be prepaired. 
    While you sleep your cilia are scrubbing the tar and nicotine off which stimulates your sense of taste and smell.               You are doing really great, Opah.   It is really cool to watch you build a sturdy quit  and to see you jump in and be an important part of community.   I am so happy you are here.     Your emotions can be all over the place while you return to your original human state.  Water your eyes, they will grow.    Try and understand your anger, it will dissipate        Remember how much fun you had last weekend ?    Imagine yourself back in your sanctuary.             
The next couple of weeks are going to be Honey do weekends. the the 8th, 9th and 10th The wife and I will be up at the Refuge.  It will be so nice, a little work to do but mostly just us Being sloths, waking up Late, eating breakfast at noon.     Yes it will be nice
    Lol..O....I never had a smoking dream ,I never slept much ...I can only imagine how weird that would feel...    Thankfully you were only dreaming ...   Sounds like peaceful times ahead ....brilliant....I'm jealous ....breakfast at noon...magic !!!!
I told the nicotine habit to go F... itself about 16 months ago. AND I still get smoking dreams. Like a couple nights ago i dreamed my room mate and i were working on her car and I found a cigarette in the garage and smoked it. In the dream though, I found some way to control the crave so i only wanted to smoke every few days.    But in reality we know how THAT works - "just one" sets off the habit pretty quick again.           15 hours ago, Doreensfree said:             Lol..O....I never had a smoking dream ,I never slept much ...I can only imagine how weird that would feel...

Like it is harmless, tasty, and all that? In smoking dreams, it really is.   Like my sister put it - "the satisfaction of smoking but without any of the consequences".Edited January 30 by Jet Black
Not my room mate's gas for once, no, something else...      I was at work the other day and in the break room rummaging the paper for the comics.       There was this entire page advertisement for one of those vape things.  Of COURSE it was saying something about using vape to quit cigarettes. Imagine.     But here was the LOUD part - the entire top 1/4 of the page was blacked out with the words in white about this product contains nicotine and nicotine is addictive. Now folks, not even cigarette and snuff ads got a warning label that big. All tobacco ever got was a puny space in the bottom corner of the page, easily overlooked.        Even though I have never vaped, i still hate it. I hope the vape companies are losing sleep knowing that they are under fire quicker and harder than tobacco ever has been.     It is kind of like when someone lies to you, the first time you believe it but when you figure out it is BS you get mad. But then they try to lie to you AGAIN and you f*****g explode! The anti-nicotine people (especially us ex-smokers) are probably more pissed than anyone. I love seeing vape companies getting their asses kicked.      I just hope these kids who see vape ads will ask, "how come that warning is so huge...?"

After they vape or use an e-cigg for a year or two and try a cigg a lot claim they get sick. so sick they wont smoke a cigg but go back to e-cigg or vape. This is the start and later on we will hear of the illnesses
    So basically then once they start vaping, they are stuck?   I have a very hard time believing that vape is any safer than a damn cigarette.

G’day   There was a time ( yes I was a 40 year smoker) when they started to put the cigs to be safer.   First it was filters. No I didn’t smoke at that time but by the time I did I wouldn’t smoke anything without one “ cause it was safer.” Hell they even brought out filters for roll your owns to make them sound safer.     Then it was making cigs with lower nicotine levels by putting pin holes in the butt and proudly making the claim that it was somehow safer to smoke. And the worse thing people, believed by that by smoking the lower nicotine levels One was able to give up. What a crock off sh1t that was. Now that want us to believe that vaping is not only “safe” but allows people to give up the cigs.   Its still full of addictive nicotine, you’ll still be addicted customer for life but don’t worry it’s safer....     And this is from the same people who have continually lied in the past. Have they suddenly got it right?    I know they couldn’t.   Same Crowd Same Lies

OK not sure why bit a Blan morning today.  I guess all the stimulous has started to where off,  yes sir I was riding hight there for a week.    My bigest challenge Yet has just emerged, it has slapped me around and confussed me, But I fought back !  At ojne point I thought i was really screwed but turned out it was a blessing in Descuise.  Setting here staring at it so Handsum and made of Precous metal, it even talks to me and follows my commands. But just like the last one its going to work its way into my life, become almost indespincable and when I need it most it is going to abandon me and fail.  it will leave me in sillence and without assistance.     I dont know why it is, I guess a have a weakness for shinny PYTs, and once I get them I cover them up too afraid Ill scratch or dull them.  I know it will happen  sooner or Later the luster will wear off, and the afair will be over, it will become mondain nothing at all special, no one will care about it any more, not even Me.  Yes it my new fasination and Facuation, its my Galaxy S7 Titainium Edge phone !   Yes to others she may be out dated, but to me she shines, her silky smouth case can easily slip thru your fingers,  thus the need to hold on tight, and dress her apropriately.   Just bought her a Cammo cover with velcro flap, belt clip and kick stand, yes she will still be styling even being covered up.
Wow.... First ..more important ..your fabulous 3 weeks ...a huge achievement ...I hope your feeling very proud ...  Phones......no ...I am crap at technology.... Ask this lot .... Sounds like you have a passionate love affair going on there...nothing wrong with that ...lol..

There is a lot of misinformation about how soon nicotine leaves your body.Many are saying, three days but, this doesn't seem to be the truth.Nicotine is far more pernicious and sticky, if you will.    I know I celebrated the 'three days free of nicotine' but I would have rather known the truth.so, in the spirit of Truth,   I give you this from DrugRehab.com  "Nicotine can be traced in saliva for up to four days, in blood for about 10 days, in urine for up to three weeks and in hair for up to three months."  in Medical News Today   "According to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry,it can take over 2 weeks for a person's blood to reach the same cotinine levels as someone who does not use tobacco.It takes several more weeks for the urine levels to become very low.Traces of nicotine may stay in the hair for longer.The more someone smokes, and the higher the frequency of smoking, the longer nicotine takes to leave the body.The exact length of time it takes for nicotine to clear differs between people:Nicotine may stay in the body for longer in adults aged over 65 years.Women tend to process nicotine more quickly than men, especially if they are taking birth control pills.The body will take longer to remove nicotine in people who have smoked more frequently and for longer."     Here is more evidenceHealthline  How long does Nicotine Stay in Your Bodyfrom IPRC &nbsp;  Nicotine Distribution and ExcretionFrom the Mayo Clinic, Nicotine and Metablolites, Serum    We are not playing with a nice drug. Nicotine is sticky, not to mention the zillion other chemicals we were freebasing while smoking.  This is all the more reasons to quit, quit early and celebrate each and every day you are nicotine free.
    Great post, this topic came up when someone was going for life insurance. Thanks!
    Yuck.  Now that I am finally quitting - I just want it out!  Why oh why did it take so long for that light bulb to go off!!!!!
I guess I'll have to celebrate again in 3 months and just enjoy the other health benefits until then.

This is from Red Orbit   How Long Does Nicotine Stay in Your Blood and BodyArchJanuary 21, 2019  Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances, which makes smoking a habit that’s notoriously hard to shake. And even if one manages to quit, traces of the substance will still be present in one’s system days after going cold turkey.E-cigarettes are considered a less harmful alternative to conventional cigarettes. However, e-cigarette cartridges contain as much as 21 to 85% nicotine. The body won’t know the difference so it will absorb the nicotine just the same.So, how long does nicotine stay in your blood and body? To get the answer, you should take a closer look at the way and rate the human body absorbs this dangerous toxin.     SMOKING AND NICOTINE INGESTIONTobacco companies make sure to provide a variety of cigarettes to suit individual nicotine addicts. On average, a single cigarette has 12 milligrams of nicotine, about 1 milligram of which reaches the bloodstream.Once inside the bloodstream, nicotine tests measure nicotine concentration in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). This depends on individual smoking habits. For example, the average smoker may have up to 50ng/ml of cotinine – one of the nicotine metabolites – in their blood. But for heavy smokers, the levels can reach a staggering 500ng/ml.     HOW LONG DOES NICOTINE STAY IN YOUR BLOOD?It’ll take about a couple of hours after smoking for your body to remove 50% of the ingested nicotine. On average, it can still be detected in the bloodstream for one to three days after you stopped smoking.The primary nicotine metabolite, cotinine, can show up in blood tests even after 10 days. The time it takes to fully purge either nicotine or cotinine from the blood may depend on the severity of the smoking habit and individual metabolism.   As for the tests, they can be divided into two categories: quantitative test for the amount of nicotine and qualitative test for the presence of the substance. But you are not out of the woods after three days. Most of the tests also look for the major nicotine metabolites, cotinine and anabasine, which are both alkaloids that stay in the blood for much longer than nicotine.   There is also a strong possibility of a false positive. The culprit for this is the chemical called thiocyanate, which appears in the bloodstream as a result of smoking but is also common in some medications and foods like cabbage and broccoli.    HOW LONG DOES NICOTINE STAY IN YOUR URINE?Things are a bit different with nicotine urine tests. For casual smokers, detectable cotinine levels can be present in urine for up to four days. This might go up to three weeks for heavy smokers.  The amount of cotinine or nicotine detected depends on the timing of the urine sample. For example, those who haven’t quit smoking may have up to 1,000 ng/mL of the substance in their urine. But a couple of weeks after quitting, the levels usually drop precipitously but may stay above 30 ng/mL, the threshold for a positive result.    The labs use different reference ranges to interpret nicotine tests. So, if need be, you might need to go over the results with your physician.     HAIR FOLLICLE AND SALIVA TESTBesides blood and urine, trace amounts of nicotine stay in your saliva and hair follicles. In fact, certain hair follicle tests might show positive results up to a year after the last nicotine exposure. But generally, traces of nicotine usually stay in hair follicles for about three months.    When it comes to saliva, it takes your body about four days to purge the saliva of nicotine and cotinine. Unlike hair follicle tests, saliva is commonly used to test for nicotine.     FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE NICOTINE LEVELSSome common rules are applicable here. As previously stated, certain individual factors also apply and may be responsible for a prolonged presence of the substance.Smokers can be divided into three categories.     Those who smoke once a week are considered light users.Their body generally gets rid of traceable nicotine in about three days after the last exposure.     Moderate users are those who smoke a few times a week and they may expect to test positive for a couple of weeks after quitting.    People who smoke on a daily basis fall under the heavy user category. The nicotine in their blood, urine, and saliva might linger for up to twelve months.      But there are other factors that come into play.With age, it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with nicotine. And the genetic makeup may also play a significant role. Certain studies indicate that Caucasian and Hispanic people metabolize the substance quicker than African and Asian people.    Hormones and liver enzymes may influence the amount of nicotine in the body as well. For example, women who take estrogen or are pregnant might get rid of nicotine faster than men.    HOW TO PURGE NICOTINE FROM YOUR BLOOD AND BODYAbstaining from cigarettes and other products that contain nicotine is the best way to get the toxin out of your system. During abstinence, the cells work hard to remove traces of nicotine from your body.In addition, there are a few things that you can do to expedite this process.     The first line of defense is being well-hydrated. In other words, the more water you drink, the faster the nicotine leaves via your urine.  An antioxidant-rich diet helps as well. Some of the foods you should go for include carrots and oranges. They contain immunity-boosting antioxidants and fibers which may accelerate nicotine removal.  Another way to boost your metabolism is to take up exercise. Nicotine and all of its metabolites are released through sweat when exercising.    THE FINAL PUFFIf you haven’t stopped smoking, now is as good a time as any to start. After abstaining from nicotine for a few months, there’ll be no need to wonder how long does nicotine stay in your blood.  REFERENCES:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946180/https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/3/176https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091743579900124https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Anabasine#section=Tophttps://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/15D8BBF6393C6093C2076546E6515457/S1834261214000279a.pdf/nicotine_pharmacology_toxicity_and_therapeutic_use.pdfhttps://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/23/suppl_2/ii30https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/electronic-cigarettes-good-news-bad-news-2016072510010

My 9 year old daughter asked me the other day if my lungs were more black or pink.  I talk to her about smoking, vaping etc. so she knows the truth about this stuff.  My Mom and my Aunt have never taken a single puff of a cigarette, despite growing up with both parents who smoked, all her brothers, uncles, aunts etc.  My goal is to teach my daughter now so she knows the consequences of smoking, vaping etc. so she doesn't even want to try any of it.
Well 14 Days done, I am sted fast and full of commitment,  you guys are the gravity of my quit world    Each of you, all of you, a vital suport, This time around will be my forever quit.  I have dedicated myself to my quit and to the assitance to others quits.        Thank you one and all
    Congratulations, Opah on your FREEDOM ! and thank you so much for all you give to us.    
    Well done O !!! All the hard work is down to you ....but have to agree ..having a good support group makes all the difference...of course this is your sticky quit !!!.....
    Woohoo, congrats on two weeks Opah!  
Celibrating with a Couple Wennersschnitzel Chilli cheese Dog, a beer would be nice but at work, but 5 hours from now !! The celibration is ON
Congrats on 2 weeks Opah, enjoy your cheese dogs..
    Congrats opah!
    Now you did it, made me hungry again !  So much for that chilli cheese Burger I was saving for lunch.
    Good on ya Opah!
    Congratulations Opah!
    Congratulations!  Glad to see you're celebrating!  You deserve it because staying quit for two weeks is no small feat!  
Just returned from a 5 day Hunting trip, and I am still a non smoker !  There were some moments there I did want a puff, the cold of the Morning, the cold of the evening and when My hunt was successful.  But all was good, getting easier to just tell myself no  aint going to Happen.  Still popping Ricolas,  helps redirect the want.  I AM ONE VERY HAPPY NON SMOKER !
    Good for you Opah  
That is great Opah.  5 days is almost through tough week.  You can do this.  Keep that quit going.
Yaaa...great news 0.....    Good trip all round I say ...high five !!!
    Thats how its done...
    Great news, Opah !  Facing lots of triggers and patterns and staying smoke free is a great accomplishment !     Very happy about your successes, quit and hunt !
    I remember last quit when I disarmed the triggers, they were solid, easy to grasp onto what they were, and once disarmed easy to keep away or avoid.    These time around it is not so solid,  more of a mist or fog,  a Ghost ! have not been smoking any where near as long, less than a year.    Not any really must smoke conditions, places or events to speak of except driving,  But none the less very softly in the background they are.   Dosn't seem to be a problem they can be dissmissed fairely easily just totally different this time around.  Just needed to write and to give these Ghostist triggers some substance. 
So I'm just over 3 months quit... 3 months 11 days to be exact.... officially the longest I've gone without a cigarette..... and it is really really hard. I feel like I quit 3 days ago. I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread right now. I am constantly thinking about and craving a cigarette. The only thing that I can do to keep myself from smoking is not smoke (it make sense to me) and that's getting harder to do. I keep reminding myself why I am doing this and all the benefits I have seen so far, but the urge really feels stronger than my sense of joy/greatfulness/contempt... ect. It's like "yup. Made it 3 months. Don't really care that it's the longest I gone just really want a cigarette."     This Sucks. Still not smoking,Edited January 21 by I Got This (T)
    Hi IGT,  "The only thing that I can do to keep myself from smoking is not smoke (it make sense to me) and that's getting harder to do" I had to replace the crutch that was smoking to me with something else. I used exercise , a straw and a fake cigg to make believe. Candy, move a muscle change a thought was the key for me. We blow our quits when we lose direction or just don't give a F.  Check out No mans land             
    Yep, I remember feeling like you at three and four months quit. Sounds like no man's land to me too. Glad you're smart enough to keep your quit because I promise it will start getting better real soon so hang in there 
Stay strong and it will get better. 3 plus months quit is huge. I would do whatever to keep it . If you have made it this far you are strong enough to keep the quit and smart enough to know giving in will only cause you pain and disappointment. If you have made it this far this is what you want for yourself. Better days will come. Best wishes.
    IGT you are doing well.  What you are going thru is common, as said before study up on no mans land as said above.  It really does get better, just be strong and try to shift your focus to the positives from quitting this.  It is good you posted -- shows your strength -- Keep it up!!!!
IGT,  I remember some earlier posts of you were you where very happy and even proud about yourself. Please think back of that and imagine yourself like that again, because that is how it will be soon enough! You will be proud, you will be relieved and you will be so happy about not giving up!       How are you now?Edited January 22 by MLMR
You got this... That's why you chose that name, because you knew you're gonna stick it out.     It's tough whenever there's a craving, but our brains are being rewired so no one promised it would be easy. But 3 months is right around when your skin quality is improving, your heart attack rates have considerably dropped, your gums have started repairing themselves, of course the ton of money you've already saved means you can pamper yourself with it.       I understand it is super tough, but your body deserves to be taken care of, so it can take care of you as the years go on.      Stick it out IGT, you truly got this!!! I believe in you.
Congrats on your fabulous 3 months Smoke Free.....  I can only mirror what all the above have said ...It really does get better ..Stick at it ....
    Be SURE to keep rewarding yourself every time you beat a crave !    Replace smokey thoughts immediately by looking at something pretty like that light on that leaf or something/someone you love.  Your quit is young, protect it with your life   and don't forget to have fun.   You Quit Smoking.  End Of.       
I'm sorry you are struggling but can be normal during the first few months.  Keep fighting, things will get better IGT.  3 months is a great accomplishment and it is not worth throwing away for a cigarette.  Smoking will do nothing positive at all.
    IGT Don't get off the train because it is going to take you to beautiful destinations!  I am so proud of my quit and each month quit I feel prouder.  Just hang tough, these feeling will pass. 
Thanks everyone for your kind words and encouragement. I will get thru this. I was a little taken back at just how strong and overwhelming my yearning for a cigarette was/is after 3 months. I'm not cranky really that I can't have one..... not any more pissy.... not barking at people.... I am quite a bit more anxious however..... have that anxious feeling in my tummy all the time, because I feel like I am in a constant battle with my brain telling it I don't want to smoke. I feel my mind racing, but not really in any particular direction.... it's almost like I am going thru a tunnel at the speed of light... with tracers and passing sounds on both sides of me.... at the end of the tunnel is the end of my cravings..... the light if you will.... and I'm stuck right in the middle... just floating...while everything else keeps passing by.....

There is light at the end of the tunnel, always.
Just a word from one who fell off of the train with just under a year nicotine free:    There is no such thing as just a taste, or just one or only today, it will end your Quit !  There were a couple times that I came very close to loosing it and the 3 month makers was one of them.  It got quite, the Rah Rah Rahs were gone, I got quite and farther from the forum, it was soon the only voice    I heared was the naging of that little nicotine memory,  Just a puff and it picked the most desiriable moments. I can't tell you when or if every one can go without the support of caring people that personally know what you are going thru, what I can tell you is This loving Caring people are like air for me, Can't see, can't touch, but they  keep me stronge safe and secure.    Continue to use us, write write write, about anything, what ever you feel you need to write about.  As I have heard and will continue to hear it does get easier  and it does !  Just got to be cautious during the slack times.
Tomorrow I'll be celebrating 5 months. And where part of the third and all of the fourth month honestly seemed like they never ended, the past fifth month was one of, uhm... whats it called? Reaping what Ive sown?       I think I should start saying it out loud, because I cant go around it anymore, it's too darn obvious: my anxiety attacks are rapidly decreasing in number and in ferocity. Mind this: I came from 2 to 3 HEAVY attacks per week, where time in between was just too little to unwind. They varied from sudden, fullblown 30minute apocalypses, to gradual tension build up, which could last half a day and leave me completely numb. It's been like that for years.   And now... I went down to 1 in two weeks, with bits and pieces of distress in between but totally incomparable to what its been. I believe part of that is because I'm paying so much more attention to what I need, when I need it ('HALT'!). I am really learning to just be with what I feel. And yep, it still s*cks from time to time. And then that's just that.      And by the way, while writing this I still have this nagging voice that says something like, 'ahhh just wait... it'll be back soon enough...dont hold your hopes so high!.'. But I know that this isn't incidental.         This is progress for the long run and I am going to be so, so, so sooooo very thankful for having quit and gaining peace of mind.       And... I am growing a super mighty ' I won't' muscle. Applicable on a daily basis, to many non-smoking related things!
    Great post MLMR, I'm really happy to read this! You are doing awesome and it's GREAT that your anxiety attacks are getting to be so few and far between  
    Great post M...don't look now...the magic has started to happen ...way to go !!!

    It is amazing the inner trust we build within ourselves by quitting smoking and the confidence we acquire to slay our demons.   This trust and strength does not fade and like a muscle gets stronger and stronger with use.    Congratulations M'Life, you have a splendid quit and I am so happy you are reaping rewards of your work.    You Rock.   S

    I was having a chat with hubby,s carer this morning...  She told me her Mum has cancer of the mouth, which has spread to her jaw bone...This coming week,she will have a operation to remove half of her tongue,and some of her jaw bone ...replacing it from bone from her leg...  I say...please tell me she has quit smoking now.... Not at all she told me ..   I could smell stale smoke on her breath too...  I just found this very sad...they both still believe all the lies surrounded by smoking.....    Very sad 
    I've lost two friends to cancer of the mouth. It's a horrible cancer to have. Both of them had so many procedures done, including removing parts of their tongues,  to try to stop it and both ended up succumbing to it 
    Awful....she says her bottom lip will be numb ..so will not be able to eat properly... This woman is in her fifties ... Im with you Jillar horrible ...I'm sorry about your friends ...I am so grateful i have been spared this ....well so far ...

Very sad                I still remember well visiting my grandfather in hospice care.  Seeing a man I loved dearly at the end of the line, succumbing to cancer after years of smoking.  First thing I did when I stepped outside: light up a cigarette.       Addiction is insidious.
    The fear of being without nicotine is greater than the fear of losing body parts or even life for some.  I wonder if the real fear is that they can succeed in quitting smoking.  I sometimes see smokers and want to tell them, "quit - don't be afraid, it won't hurt you."

Gday    A news report from Australia where it’s not legal to sell vaping liquids that contain nicotine. Testing has shown over 1/2 do contain nicotine. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-12/not-all-e-juices-are-as-nicotine-free-as-they-claim/9857540  Pretty disturbing as many unwitting are putting nicotine into bodies.
    Hey @Cbdave, what's it like up north... I don't think Vaping is as big a thing here as it is in the northern hemisphere, I know its not in Melbourne, there are vapers bet we all think they are a littls wanky and its not that common.... how is it in the land of the banana and cane toad?
G’day   I know of a few people that vape and sort of fluctuate between the vape and cigerettes so I don’t think it’s a real way of weaning of the cigs. All I hear from them is the same kind of excuses as I used as a smoker.     One friend said something to me once that really stuck a note with me and I’ve never forgot it. When I asked him why he didn’t vape anymore his rely was that one night when drinking he went through enough vape to be equal to 80 cigs. No sore throat or anything to warn him to back off. He only realised next day and gave it away as he was worried that he could poison himself. He had friends that had been made sick as there was not way to tell how strong the stuff was. He still smokes cigerettes.   No nicotine based juice can legally be sold here so there is no regulation or standards to protect anyone. That’s a worry, it’s worse than illegal drugs you don’t know what your going to get through the mail from some clown on the internet.   Sorta a bit worrying when it’s suposed to be safer than smoking cigs.   So vapers that I know are still smokers really they just change between the nicotine delievery style, the addictions the same.  Like smoking I hate the addiction but like the people cause I was that addict once  C
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-program-launched-help-curb-teen-vaping-epidemic-n960371?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma          Jan. 18, 2019, 2:17 PM EST  By Cynthia McFadden and Kenzi Abou-Sabe WASHINGTON — When Principal Kimberly Martin sent out the Woodrow Wilson High School weekly newsletter over winter break, she was looking for help.  Martin's school, the largest in the nation's capital, was experiencing the same phenomenon that teachers and principals across the country have described over the last year — an explosion in teen vaping use — but her budget didn't allow for the substance abuse program she'd used at her previous school. In her newsletter, Martin quoted Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who had just called youth vaping an epidemic, and posted pictures of e-cigarettes that had been confiscated on campus.   "When I got here, I would say there was an issue with it, but I think it's gotten worse, progressively worse, over the last four years," said Martin, who estimates that roughly half of the juniors and seniors are using e-cigarettes.    Woodrow Wilson High School Principal Kimberly MartinTODAY   Struggling to grapple with the epidemic, the Food and Drug Administration is holding a public hearing Friday to solicit ideas on the best interventions to curb youth e-cigarette use.  Among the presenters at the forum in Silver Spring, Maryland, will be Truth Initiative, a nonprofit best known for its envelope-pushing anti-smoking ads aimed at teens and young people. The group has now created a first-of-its kind text messaging program designed to help young people quit vaping.   "We started seeing more and more that people were posting that their New Year's resolution was to leave JUUL and to quit e-cigarettes, but they weren't finding any help," said Megan Jacobs, who works on Truth's innovations team and led the project. "So we said, 'Hey, we've got programs. We could adapt those programs to help people quit e-cigarettes as well as we could help them quit smoking.'"    The program, which officially launches Friday, allows anyone to text "QUIT" to 202-804-9884, anonymously and free of charge. Users are then asked to choose an age bracket so they can start receiving tailored daily text messages of support and tips for quitting. Truth worked with young people who had either quit or were trying to quit, to make the program's messaging more effective.    The program, which officially launches Friday, allows anyone to text "QUIT" to 202-804-9884, anonymously and free of charge.TODAY   According to the latest CDC data, 3.05 million high school students and 570,000 middle-schoolers were using e-cigarettes in 2018. That's a total of 3.62 million kids, up from only 280,000 in 2011.    The numbers have spiked since the 2015 introduction of Juul, a cartridge-based e-cigarette that's been wildly popular with kids. Current use among high school students rose 78 percent in a single year, from 2017 to 2018.    Dr. Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine whose research centers on adolescent addiction and substance use, said there is still a sizable gap in researchers' understanding of e-cigarette use and how drug therapies may affect young vapers.   "We can't say just because you are vaping e-cigarettes I am going to give you a nicotine patch or nicotine gum, because we don't really know how addicted these kids are to the nicotine in e-cigarettes," Krishnan-Sarin said. "We need to need to understand that first before we move to the medication realm."  Krishnan-Sarin said behavioral approaches, on the other hand, have a proven track record when it comes to youth smokers.    "Not telling kids what to do, but educating them about what's bad about the product, these kinds of behavioral techniques have shown to be effective for youth smoking combustible cigarettes," she said. "We have found over time that if you educate kids and make them understand by presenting information to them in a non-judgmental fashion, they come to the conclusion themselves."    Recommended politicsImpeachment talk grows louder after report Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress  featureJudge rules against elderly lesbians rejected from retirement home   The Truth Initiative adopts the same philosophy, offering users messages focused on delivering education and motivation rather than fear.   "You can't frighten people into changing their behavior. It doesn't work in losing weight, it doesn't work in exercise, and it doesn't work here," Truth Initiative CEO Robin Koval said.   Teenage users of the program could get messages like, "Is it hard to not JUUL in places you're not supposed to, like school? Reply YES or NO." There's also an option for parents designed to educate them about the devices and help them support children dealing with nicotine addiction.    Truth Initiative used the structure of their quit-smoking programs of the past, but the messages were completely rewritten. The program creators were particularly mindful that the experience of vaping is unique from smoking, Koval said.    "Some of the negative cues from smoking—you know, your hair smells, your clothes smell, your fingers are yellow — all of that sort of thing that makes you want to quit are not as present in vaping," Koval said. "So we have to work with other sorts of messages and cues to help you see even the benefits of your quit process."   Martin, the principal at Wilson High, is hoping many of her students will soon be experiencing those benefits.  After she sent out her e-cigarette-focused newsletter, Martin received grateful messages from several parents, including one who works for Truth Initiative. "I've got an idea," the parent wrote in an email.  Wilson will now serve as a testing ground for Truth Initiative's text message-based quit-vaping program, with a unique phone number so that the organization's researchers can analyze how the Wilson community interacts with it.  "We're going to put it in the newsletter. We're going to put it on our website. We plan to do robocalls and all of the kind of methods that we communicate with parents to get people aware that this campaign is happening," Martin said.  Anya, a senior at Wilson High School who regularly uses e-cigarettes, said she's considering enrolling in the program. "I've always looked at the 'smoke to quit' ads on the metro and I've thought, 'That's a good idea. Maybe I should tell some friends of mine who smoke a lot of cigarettes about that,'" Anya said. "So I think, yeah, there could be one for vaping. There's a niche for that."
     
Rainy Days !  Now after like a week of Rain it really came down hard this morning, so Hard you could hear it beating down on the roof of the DC.    And Then BAM it hit me, this huge trigger a wantin desire to smoke, and all the pleasure imaging that goes with it !    Damn lucky I still have the super quiter power Lin instilled me with this morning.  Popped some B12s and sucking on a Ricola. hands busy today  and I have my hoodie to stay warm .   HAAA HAAA  you viale nicotine Habit, I don't need you for warmth, I don't need you for my hands to be busy, i don't need you because its wet and raining, as A matter of Fact MR Nicotine, I don;t need you at all   !!

    As I was leaving Hell week I looked ahead,  the assent wasn’t as steep and the obstacles were fewer.    Thinking of how happy and accomplished I felt,  I suddenly started to sob, uncontrollably sob after a few minutes it Was done.  I thought to Myself what the Hell was that !    A soft comforting voice from over the mountain said, welcome to What the Heck week Opah.

    I just found this,  hope you like it too.    
One of my favorite posts....from member Paul723 "Your quit is like a baby you carry on your chest. You protect it from harm. You never leave it behind or discard it. You know anything someone says bad about it is a lie and you know it is the best thing you have. You don't let life come between you and your quit. You never think that something would be easier to do if you left it behind. This is simply not an option. You feel its heartbeat and you keep it warm and alive.AndYouDon'tSmoke."
I looked for the exact quote and wasn't able to find it, but Paul said something to the effect of: "You can't fight the waves, but you can learn to surf." Wise words.
I looked for the exact quote and wasn't able to find it, but Paul said something to the effect of: "You can't fight the waves, but you can learn to surf." Wise words.Love this: I wrote this a while ago for someone who was struggling, and was asked to share it.  This person had said that she was having waves of anxiety and smoking thoughts.  I hope it can help someone!   Ride the wave, man, it's like, gnarly.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  OK, I might be taking a metaphor too far here, but...you know how at the beach when you want to swim out beyond the breakers?  To where it is nice and calm and you can just float.  As you wade in, it seems like the waves keep wanting to push you back to shore.  And at first they knock you over-- they tumble and toss you underwater; they throw you into the sand, and you can't even tell which way is up.  But you are tenacious, and you want to get beyond the breakers.  So this time you try to just pretend the waves aren't there.  You turn your back to them and plant your feet, but they still smack you on the back; they leave a red mark and they push you over.  But this time it didn't push you over all the way-- you are still in the water.  You don't have to wade back anymore.  The next wave that comes, you decide to turn your body sideways and jump a little bit.  It feels weird to jump at first, but then you realize that you actually have more control that way.  That little jump, that leap of faith, makes things so much easier.  This time, you feel the power of the wave, but it doesn't hurt you.   Next, you see a really big wave coming.  It looks ominous.  It's already starting to break. You know that if you try to stand up to it, it will just tumble your butt back to shore.  It might rip off your bathing suit top while it's at it.  You can't flail around, you can't turn your back, you can't even turn to the side.  Instead, you take a deep breath, and you just dunk yourself underwater and wait for it to roll over you.  You come back up, and you're a little panicked.  Where are you??  But within an instant you realize that you are beyond the breakers, right where you want to be.  Where it is calm, and you can see the shore, and just float.  This time, you felt the power of the wave, and you allowed it to help you. I think you are at the point where you are turning yourself sideways.  Hang on, pretty soon you will be diving headlong into those waves.  I'll see you at the beach soon with my boogie board!

Your advice that night was also excellent Nancy: It makes me mad that smoking does not fix any of the things I used to think it fixed.  And that I have to learn to fix everything in a different way.  And then sometimes the light bulb goes on and I realize that it is not my job to fix it, or that it is not in my power to fix it, or, in my case, I am trying to fix things that are none of my business... SoberJulie had worked it out for herself earlier like this: You don't have to be #1 at anything today.You don't have to figure things out, or understand, or make sure everyone (or Someone) understands you.You don't have to remember everything, or get all organized and start making lists.You don't have to solve every -- or any -- problem you have today (or solve someone else's problems today either).You don't have to figure out what will make you happy, or what you should do with your life.Those are good things to do of course, and come with a measure of reward or satisfaction or comfort. That's very true. I'm not saying those things are completely unimportant.But you don't have to do any of those things today.All you have to do today is not pick up that first cigarette.One hour at a time.One five minutes at a time.Until your head hits the pillow.And if you do that,you win.That's it.And the rest of that s*** will just have to work itself out or wait its turn.Smoke free first.The rest second.
Hi Nancy!!!
    bump
Who will be born in July 2019... I promise you wont have a Nan who stinks like an ashtray.......only sweet fresh kisses for you     I'm so excited and looking forward to meeting you..
Congratulations Nan Catlover..... what a great Chrissy present that news was... and your lucky grandbaby will not be getting stinky nan hugs ..... great way to celebrate your 11 month anni.
    Thank you Jo....... Yes no stinky Nanny here.. no nipping off out every hour missing out on the cuddles, and touching baby with stinky fingers ..oooh no..... 
    Congratulations ....there is no better love ,than that of a Nanna....its so special.... What better reason to Keep The Quit ...xxxxx
    Congrats on the great news CL! Yet another reason to stay smoke-free  
    Congratulations catlover, how exciting for you 
    Lovely news, catlover, and even more incentive to keep your precious quit.
    Catlover what great news for the New Year and yes to be a smoke free grandparent will be so awesome!!!
    Oh Catlover, how exciting.  Grand kids are the best.  You are going to have many wonderful magic moments and memories ahead.  Quitting smoking, you will have the energy and a lifetime to enjoy them.  We will all be anxiously waiting the pictures!
    Catlover, late to the news as seems to be the case these days. I'm so very happy for you and your family.       Cats everywhere will still be celebrating the new generation.       A beautiful start to the year. 
    Wowie Catlover, congratulations.        You're gonna be a phenomenal Nan, full of energy to keep up with the little champ.
    Thank you, all going well, and my knitting is improving 
My work day usually starts at 9:00 am--or, at least, it has been for a few weeks. Today I begin work at 12:30. Time is motionless. The sensation of being suspended in air is unsettling, and in such a state of mind, I want a cigarette. This is a situation when, in the past, I would smoke. It would be a time--smoking--when I would collect my thoughts. A grounding time.       Since I haven't been smoking for the past month (yaay), this would be a time when I would eat something sweet. I've begun reversing the trend of weight gain, so no sweets to provide a dopamine hit.   Feeling fatigued early in the day. Fuzzy minded.    Going to take the dog for a walk. That's what a nonsmoker would do, right? And what a non-overeater would do. OK, I can do this.    After that, maybe I'll take a short nap. But then, I'm so afraid I'll oversleep and be late for work.   I'll set two alarm clocks.  Staying Quit takes some adjusting. My brain is weary from rethinking so that I don't fall into automatic actions, like going to the store to buy cigarettes, then falling wearily into a chair on the patio with coffee.    Sound familiar?
    You will get to know your new life. Have patience and drink deep from the cup of NOPE.
    Yep, sounds very familiair. It's something you have to find your way through. It won't last forever. Its a fase, it will pass. And then a different  fase wiI follow...  I did and still do lots of walking, to pass time and to stop my mind from racing on about smoking.         One month, nice! Well done. 
    It takes time  to adjust ....our junkie brain has to be unscrambled.... The more you do something ..the easier it gets ...the only way is to plough on...   This is why it's called a journey ...we meet new challenges along the way...and then suddenly ..it all get comfortable...   Well done on your first month ...that's a achievement...
    I agree with all above. And even though you're trying nt too, in these early months sweets do help with the fuzziness so try to drink some juice or have a candy. There's lots of low calorie sweets out there to help keep the weight off  
    OK.... peppermints are often sugar free.... or low cal.... and peppermints help with concentration, fatigue and focus... its why you should always have some in your center console for long drives... sucking peppermints help keep you alert.
    So Far so good for you,  get some Hard candys Sugar free OK, not sugar free still ok, put them where you would have normally had your cigarettes for me my shirt pocket.  When the urge to lite up Happens Reach in take one out and suck on it, Replace the smoke with a candy.    with a month under your belt your are running free, there will be very few hick ups in yoour Getty ups.    Enjoy, Take Pride and flaunt your month old nicotine free YOU !

Disturbing.     I know three people who vape and, not kidding, these people are loosing their soul ever since they started that sh*t. They treat that device like it's some precious jewel or something. They have become more nervous, less interested in the world around them. I talked to an acupuncturist, he said he's had an significant increase of customers, vapers, with anxiety problems.  I don't really read a lot about this, but my instinct tells me that this is bad. Edited January 15 by MLMR
Nicotine poisoning is a very real thing.    Symptoms of nicotine poisoning  Nicotine poisoning tends to occur in 2 stages.      Within the first 15 to 60 minutes following exposure, symptoms are related to the stimulatory effects of nicotine and include:      excess saliva in the mouth  feeling nauseous    stomach ache    vomiting    loss of appetite    dehydration eye irritation  headache    dizziness   tremors anxiety and restlessness    confusion   sweating    cough   rapid breathing increased heart rate    elevated blood pressure     Following this stage, the body begins to wind down. Nicotine's depressor effects appear within a few hours. These include:      low blood pressure  slow heart rate shallow breathing   diarrhea    fatigue weakness    pale skin       In extreme cases, symptoms include:     seizures    coma    breathing difficulties  respiratory failure Serious or fatal nicotine overdoses can occur.

    It is very disturbing that this vaping is taking such a hold on young people. Nicotine is nicotine no matter how you decide to use it. To kick the habit, I understand the short term use of patch or gum to get over the hump and hard times we all encounter but this is a whole different animal. It sort of reminds me when cigs first had filters. We would think this is not as bad as non-filter. BS as we know now. I hate government regulations but the vaping industry needs to do more to educate the young consumer or action should force them just as it did the cigarette industry. Same old turd, brand new toilet.
    I've been hearing commercials much more frequently where "real" people talk about how they made the "switch".  The masses are being led to believe they've quit smoking if they move to vaping.  It's disgusting that a deadly product can be advertised in that manner.
    You know I was concidering vaping as a alternative to smoking but I also wanted to be free of the Nicotine. Seems with the Vaping Industry you can't have nicotine free Vape ?  so on goes the adiction.   The people I know that vape keep ketting the stronger and stronger nicotine oils,    When will people see its the same fisherman (Tabaco industry ) they just changed the Hook and bait !
'a Journey'  is the philosophical way of looking at it. 'Shitty, empowering and highly challenging' is what I'd rather call it.         If there's one thing I know after 145 days of being smoke free, it's that I. WILL. NEVER. EVER. PUT. MYSELF.THROUGH. THIS. CRAP. EVER. AGAIN. Crystal clear motivation.         Quitting has had an effect on my relationships, my work, my daily rhytm, my everything. It's like I am reinventing myself, but not in a gradual, beautiful way. At some point the caterpillar seemed to evolve in something completely different than a colourful butterfly...      The dust is still settling. I've come to some pretty sad but strengthening conclusions: I am capable of mourning and going to a funeral of someone I hold dear and not smoke. I can find myself in the middle of relationship crisis and still stand my ground.  I found some consolation in staying true to myself, regarding my quit. I can deal with heavy panick attacks and remain without cigarettes . Anxiety seems to be diminishing by the way, but since that would be a glorious hallelujah and I am so afraid of disappointing myself with hope, for now I won't be focussing on that (but yeah. It is actually less of a daily base problem. Hoooly cow. Aaahhhhhh. Imagine if that pattern persists. I would get back part of my life).  I discovered that I'm pretty much through with my job but I have to endure untill I find something else. Realisation of missing out on proper grown-up education hits harder than ever, now that I'm unable to dull these thoughts. But there's a tiny glimpse of something new: 'if I can do this, I may be capable of so much more'. Shitting seven colours... but looking in to re-educating.     I am learning to dance my waltz with time. If quitting does one thing, it's messing with perspective. Since one month or so, I feel like I am regaining 3D view again. I am able to see depth once more and I am learning to be here now, without losing my horison.    Next week will mark five months for me. I have many reasons to continue like I do. But one thought is most empowering: it's all in my hands!Edited January 14 by MLMR

    That’s some mighty fine self reflection MLMR, very encouraging.  I, too,  used the agony of quitting as motivation to stay quit. Hell no I’m never going through that again!!!      Sound’s like you conquered some pretty big life stressors without smoking. That’s a big deal!       Carry on... 
    You are doing great, MLMR!

Hey you Guys !    The aventure continues,  6 days nicotine free  Edited January 14 by Opah
    Wow...here we go. My first huge test and crave since the beginning of this adventure. Just found out the company I work for is being sold. Tital waves right now. What’s b!tch.
    Oh wow, that is a biggie. Uncertainty at work does suck. What's the chat? Whats everyone saying? Fingers crossed for you. Zero point smoking, it will not help anything! Just stick around here if you are struggling. How are you feeling? 
    Oh man that is a biggie wantsit but you got this. You have two awesome months under your belt so try to think positive about it. It could end up being a good thing  
    Don't let anything compromise your quit.    Dig what @Cristóbal has to say,Your Quit -----Your Life The Proper Sequence.        One door closes, one door opens.    Hang tight to your resolve, you will win at everything.
    Wow!!!....What a bummer...hoping for a OK result....    As its been said ..Smoking won't change anything ....you will be more gutted ,if you gave away your fab quit ...    This is one thing you are in control of ...stay close ...shout out if you need help ...
    Oh my goodness Wansit.  I have the prayers going.  Don't stress what may not need stressing.  You have this quit so don't let go.  We are here for you.
    I feel for you, Wantsit.  I hope things work out for the best but, having been in that situation myself, I know it is stressful.        Please read the link that Sazerac posted by Cristobal (Your Quit and Your Life).  I often went to that thread when things were really stressing me and it helped keep my quit in the right perspective.     I hope all works out for the best but a cigarette will not make any situation better...only worse.
    I just want to begin this by saying thank you to all of that are out there supporting us that are liable to stumble. I had the perfect chance and excuse to fail but didn't , and who knows what will happen in the weeks to come but I haven't yet. I feel most of my strength has come from my support and knowledge that I have gotten from a few very good people here. THANK YOU! I have the utmost respect for all of you.
    Wansit, you are not going to stumble because you are strong.  No matter what circumstances life throws at us, it will not have to change our quit.  Life has many bumps in the road but we always navigate through them, and I have found that I always come out stronger on the other side.  Hang tough.  Don't let the uncertainty wobble your quit.  Shout out if you need us.
    I knew you would keep that great quit you have  Positive thoughts that everything at work ends up well 
Hi Wantsit.... glad you got through this without giving up your quit. Its a big shock when your stability wobbles. I was 4-5 months in when I found out my employer was closing. I had been there over 16 years... it was hard and for a while I had no job because I didn't look while they closed down so I could help them with the wind up.... but then I found a new job, I don't love it like my old job, yet, but they pay may a lot more than my old employer and I am finding my feet... I don't think it will ever feel like the old job did but it might ... what I learnt though was that I was worth way more than I thought .. lets just say I got over a 50% pay increase.... So financially I am much better off and yes it was scary and stressful and daunting but that old saying when one door closes another opens is true ... and while I still have my training wheels on ... going through that during my first year quit made my quit strong because it helped me to realise I was in control and I could do it despite hurdles.       I am so proud of you for not lighting up during this shock... hope all works out well on the job front.
Can we all come and work at your place jo? Think we'd all like a 50% pay rise       Good on you wantsit. You should be feeling really proud of yourself and more confident in your quit. That was a toughie and you didn't smoke

..."bright lines," a term that [George] Ainslie borrows from lawyers. These are clear, simple, unambiguous rules. You can't help but notice when you cross a bright line. If you promise yourself to drink or smoke "moderately," that's not a bright line. It's a fuzzy boundary with no obvious point at which you go from moderation to excess. Because the transition is so gradual and your mind is so adept at overlooking your own peccadilloes, you may fail to notice when you've gone too far. So you can't be sure you're always going to follow the rule to drink moderately. In contrast, zero tolerance is a bright line: total abstinence with no exceptions anytime. It's not practical for all self-control problems--a dieter cannot stop eating all food--but it works well in many situations. Once you're committed to following a bright-line rule, your present self can feel confident that your future self will observe it, too. And if you believe that the rule is sacred--a commandment from God, the unquestionable law of a higher power--then it becomes an especially bright line. You have more reason to expect your future self to respect it, and therefore your belief becomes a form of self-control: a self-fulfilling mandate. I think I won't, therefore I don't. (Baumeister and Tierney, 2011, pages 185-186.)      Baumeister, Roy F. and Tierney, John. Willpower: Rediscovering the greatest human strength. (2011). New York. The Penguin Press.        I feel more confident about saying "N.O.P.E." (never ever)--in addition to "not today," when I imagine a bright line into the future, separating my bright path from a dismal path that descends into darkness. That imagery and concept are helpful for me. Adding another coat of bright-paint to the line each day when I pledge to not smoke reinforces my willpower to stay on this light-filled side of the bright line.
    You are building a strong and sturdy quit, Kate, good on ya.     NOPE ~ Never/Ever/Forever
I got a bunch of sleep last night. I feel ok with myself today. i am nearly to day 5. only having two cups of coffee today. This has been a reallly long week for me. i feel almost normal today
    Love this post C... You sound so positive !!!.....high five !!!
Good for you Christine, and you're almost done with hell week!      A question: can you change your quit date to your new one and maybe put your old date in your signature or vise versus? I go by the quit date to give you the replies for where you are in your quit. I would hate to tell you, well at 7 months quit yadda yadda yadda......
    welcome to your new you !
    Glad your feeling better.
    Great job! 
Do tell about the post-one-year cravings...         I have definitely had cravings over the past year, but they've really died down.  I even had a month with none at all (I swear - it was month 10 or 11, I can't remember).  A few crept up during the last month, but now... I have cravings on a daily basis, and they are NOT the little passing nostalgic ones - they feel more physical.  Is this a thing?  I know it's all in my head, but why now?  It's not cool.  Is it because I came into this year with full-on confidence?  Am I losing my edge?
I had/have those too farmgirl, I think that just because we have a year, or almost three in my case, quit it still is nothing to the amount of years we smoked. So for a lot of us it's totally normal.     The beauty is that these craves are nothing like the bad craves we had in the beginning of our quits right? On New Year's eve I told my husband that I kinda felt like having a cigarette. Of course I didn't but it was a thought that popped in my head.  I figure that I smoked for 35 years so it may take years to get over all the craves
    Hey @farmgirl,  These craves are the last live embers of addiction as you put it to sleep.  Remember, Addiction doesn't magically go away, it is something we must live with forever.   The quicker we silence our smokey thoughts, the quieter the addiction becomes.      At a certain point after the first year,  I could no longer call my smokey thoughts craves, they were just wisps of a phantom.      You may find this post helpfulLifetime of Addiction  
G’day   A crave in week 1 of quiting is like stuffing a rat in a coffee can. You hold the lid down. As the oxygen level runs down that little rat/crave is in the fight for its life.   Youve got hold of the lid. Are you letting go....No away are you letting that little sh1t out...... all in all it’s pretty draining. Your fighting for you life too.    A craving at year one is like a wasp flying into you drink bottle.  “ where the hell did that come from?”   You’re not that stupid to think you can just release it. You know how dangerous that would be. Without another thought you screw the lid down and chuck it in the bin.  Problem? What problem! it’s solved  C

I was talking to a fella just recently who relapsed after 24 years - can you believe that - 9 years later he is still smoking and is fighting the battle to try and quit again.
It's not unusual.  I still remember cravings hitting me periodically, but in waves, after a year.  At airports of all places.  The big picture is that the cravings will continue to grow weaker and less frequent.         However this might be a good time to review the reasons you quit to begin with.  Write the reasons down on a piece of paper and keep the list with you at all times. Revisit the Newbie Package and Joel's pages, and read and remember.  Revisit any practices that helped you early on. Your resolve will become even stronger and the cravings will continue to weaken and become less frequent.     Hang in there!! You've beat this thing and all you need to do is remain vigilant!Edited January 12 by JOD
    Here are some resources from our friend, Joel,Craves or thoughts that occur over time.
Hello, this is my first time posting. I am 33 years old and came down with the flu a few weeks ago, which lead to pneumonia. 10 days after I was diagnosed with pneumonia I was hospitalized for 3 days due to low blood oxygen levels. I was released from hospital last Monday  (2 nights ago). During my sickness I did not smoke. It was a struggle to breathe and I had no desire to smoke. I told myself I would never smoke again because I made it this far. Also, after getting a glimpse of what living with lung disease is like, I wanted to quit before I developed a more long-term lung disease. Well since getting out of hospital I have really been struggling. I am so emotional. Partly because I missed out on so much over the Christmas break due to my illness, and Christmas is my favourite time of the year. Partly because not smoking makes me sad. I don't even fully understand why I am so sad, but I have been crying a lot. I work from home so I am all alone during the day, and being back to my normal routine makes me feel like I am missing out by not taking my smoke breaks. I know it sounds silly, but I feel very deprived. Anyways, today I broke down and found my pack of cigarettes that I gave to my non-smoking husband (they were in his sock drawer) and smoked three. My lungs are still recovering, it was so stupid. Now I'm even more emotional. I don't want to be a smoker, but I love smoking. Sorry for the rambling. just feeling very emotional and thought I'd try reaching out to others who might understand what I am going through.    I should also add, I was a pack-a-day smoker from 14 yrs - 27 yrs. I quit for 2 years, using the patch for 3 months, when my husband and I decided to try for a baby. We got pregnant with twins. I stupidly started again around their first birthday. At first it was just a couple of smokes a day with my coffee during their nap, but it slowly turned into a half-a-pack-a-day habit. Now I want to quit even more for them, so I can be around as long as possible, be healthy for them, and set a good example. Nevertheless, the cravings are so strong.
    It sounds like your experience at Christmas was pretty scary and you need to keep that in mind as motivation to quit for good. Education about this addiction is key so please read all you can here and watch some of the Joel video's that may address some of your questions and concerns. The support you will receive here is amazing and comes fro others who are in the process or have already quit successfully so .... we get it! We understand what you are going through. The mental process of quitting is what takes the most effort and time and that's why you feel lost or like you're missing something right now. You need time to retrain your brain to be comfortable as a non smoker again. It takes time. No short cuts unfortunately.   Others will be along to give you some tips and advice too. It's a great place to keep in touch with if you are serious about quitting    Welcome aboard CanadianProud  
    Welcome Canadianproud, quitting smoking is an emotional roller-coaster the first few weeks/months. Some cry, some get angry. It's all normal and something we have to go through when we quit. First thing you must do though is throw out the cigarettes. If you don't have any than there are none to find right? Next you need to continue to take your breaks, just do something else instead of smoking. Or if worse comes to worse, smoke an air cigarette. I used mine for months. It's simply pretending you're holding a cigarette and then going through the motions of "smoking" it. Some have used cut straws, pens etc. It works great at tricking your mind into thinking it's getting the real thing.    I loved smoking too until my lungs got so damaged that I decided liked breathing more.  Congratulations on your twins, I'm a twin, and just think of how cool it will be that they will never know their mom was a smoker as long as you quit now. You can do it. Stick close to the board. I was glued to it my whole first year. Lot's to do to keep you occupied and educated on this addiction  
Hi Canadian proud, welcome and love the name btw  I used the patches early in my quit. Looks like you had a decent quit on them....could you maybe go back on them? Might be just what you need to get through the difficult first few weeks. I'd get down to the pharmacy asap!!   You've come to the right place for help and support. You have brilliant reason to quit - being healthy and living long for your twins. You don't want to be a stinky mum, missing out on so much because of smoking! I quit as a young mum I know under 40 got diagnosed with lung cancer and she subsequently died. Quit now!!! That is the harsh reality but when you stop ignoring that...quitting is much easier.
    Hello Canadian Proud, Welcome to the Train.  The first few weeks can be hard, and I also felt low and very tired. I went to bed early and napped as much as possible. I found listening to sleep relaxation music helped me to de stress and go with the flow.  Watching Joel Spitzer Videos also helped me a lot. Pamper yourself, treat yourself, and allow yourself to eat what you want in the first few weeks, dont worry about weight gain, you can tackle that later when you are stronger. It will be the best thing you can do for yourself and your babies.   All the best and take care 
Welcome CP... So emotionally I didn't handle things too well on previous quits...partly it was not knowing about quitting affecting your blood sugar levels .. partly it's because smoking for me was very linked to my emotions. I knew that going in this time so I knew form me the important thing was to break the habit/ritual first. I needed to reprogram how I took breaks and rewarded myself and coped with stress...I had to reprogram all that stuff before dealing with the physical... I used NRT gum... Gave myself up to 6 months on it and i needed much less... Doesn't mean I still wasn't emotional..but it took the edge off to let me work on the harder part for me.    Now Christmas I hear you... So down under in the wonderful land of Aus we do Christmas in July....basically because Chrissy time here is summer we miss out (or don't enjoy as much) tradition hot Christmas stuff. So Chrissy day is usually in the 30s Celsius...so in July we do Christmas dinner like you Noryhies and wear our jumpers... You could have a Christmas in July...and do Aussie Christmas foods...cold seafood platters, salads, cold game off the bone...cold roast chook..trifle..pavlova...jelly cups and fairy bread.....backyard cricket or would it be lacrosse for you lot or baseball.. Just so you have something to look forward to before next Chrissy...for 1 week you get to play the Chrissy carols and they don't send you mental...trust me 36c and songs about let it snow have wierd psychological effects.
    CP      You have so many reasons to quit.  You just need to learn that smoking is not a reward or pleasure or relaxer.  It's a cold-blooded killer.  And there are no valid excuses to justify smoking.  Like missing Christmas, or feeling that your smoke breaks are your special time.  Phooey!      Time to take this bull by the horns and slam it to the ground.  Fortunately, there's lot's of information right here on this forum to help you get through this.  It still won't be a walk in the park (at least for the first few months).  But watching videos, reading how other's coped with similar situations, and offering your help to fellow quitters will make this a much more achievable goal.  It's worth the effort.  You're worth it!
Welcome aboard, CP!         Life without cigarettes is a great thing.  I'm sorry to hear that you relapsed after 2 years but I hope you saw that life was better then without having to plan you life around when you could get your nicotine fix.  You just simply have to commit to never taking another puff and leaving those cigarettes behind you for good.       Read up on this site about nicotine addiction.  This education can really help you stay quit for good.  Keep reaching out if you need help.     It is good to have you here.  You can do this!
    OK, bebe.,  It is time to quit, right ? The answer to this is YES, It IS TIME TO QUIT.  So, know that You can quit.     I quit, all these lovely people quit.   It is not rocket science.       It is about making a commitment to yourself.        Embrace the new day, quit nicotine and be a free person.    You can do this.    Prepare yourself with education about nicotine addiction    and hold on for the ride.   You won't regret a thing.   Love,   S
Hi Canadian Proud.  You have found the right place for the support and help to guide you through the quit journey.  I smoked for 42 years and attempted many quits without success. Once I found this forum, it was almost as if they took my hands and guided me through.  I love the power I feel and my self esteem is through the roof knowing that I am not anchored to such a filthy habit.  How blessed you are to have twins and you are going to want to be there for every magical moment in their lives.  So please join us.  We are here for you!
Welcome aboard .... Time to dust down ...and get the job of quitting done ,your lungs will be ever so grateful...   I smoked 52 years...it's doable ...you just need to want it bad enough....  Those two lovely babes is a very good reason ...    Make the decision to never stick anything in your mouth ,and set fire to it ...ever....no matter what is happening in your life ... My hubby has end stage Emphysema....This is one illness you want to avoid at all costs .... Stay close ...
All I want to (or feel that I can) add at this point is that, in 2001, I "lost" (the more appropriate phrase is "gave up") a quit of about 21 days.  Somehow, I was able to marshal the energy to  begin again.  And seventeen-plus years later, my life has been transformed and literally saved by beginning again.       All the best, and we know you can do it--       Christian99 17+ years quit
    Nope
Hi      The best time to quit was 20 years ago the second best time to quit is now.     Do it now if only for your children.
Nope going on 7 years - celebrate every single nope - they add up quickly!!
Posted 30 March 2015 - 09:14 AM Quitting smoking leaves us with a terrible emptiness that, for a while, we don't know exactly how to handle. And we may even ask ourselves if we will ever be able to fill these voids with anything. What helped me to get over this was eventually understanding that the source of the problem wasn't the absence of cigarettes, but the mere existence of those terrible feelings I was dealing with.       They were there all along, but I was trying to cover them all up with smoke... The moment I stopped smoking, I started to realize and acknowledge all those things that were wrong in my life and I've been trying to get rid of by hiding behind a curtain of cigarette smoke. But they didn't disappear, they have been watching me silently and now, as the smoke cleared, we are starting to make eye contact again. Should I light a cigarette so I become blind again? Or should I finally tackle the beasts? The answer is clear. I will attack.     So ask yourself, as you are ripped by this feeling of emptiness: is it ok that a small piece of paper filled with tobacco has become such an important part of my life? Is it ok that I have become emotionally attached to a small piece of paper filled with tobacco?!        Don't hide behind the curtain of smoke again. Don't choose to run again. Make the most of the fact that you are finally capable to see your life as it really is and you finally have the chance to fill those voids. Fill your short and precious life with people, places, hobbies and knowledge. Put things that actually matter inside those voids, because blowing smoke inside them will never, ever, make them disappear.
    This is right whete i am at. Thx.
    Here here Jillar. Well said.

I'm not sure if there are others out there who believe that smoking and lying go hand-in-hand, but I found myself lying to people throughout my life about whether I smoked, how much I smoked, and if it was effecting my health.  This is a post I wrote a few years ago.     Most of us smokers began our years or decades of addiction back when we were teens.  We learned to lie about smoking right from the very beginning.  Usually it started with our parents asking why we smelled like a rancid ashtray.  “Oh, I was at Johnny Picklefork’s house and his mom smokes like a chimney” I nervously responded.  “That Bertha Picklefork really needs to cut back” my mom would chuckle.       A few months later my mother met me at the door with a pack of reds in her hand as I returned from school.  “Young man, what was this doing in your sock drawer?” I let out a small sigh of relief knowing that it was only the cigarettes that she found. “Um, Tammy Tamblanadana’s brother was grounded for smoking so Tammy asked if I could hold on to them for a few days”.        Sometime later my dad drove by me holding a cigarette in my hand while hanging out with the neighborhood kids. When asked about this at dinner, I effortlessly told him, “I was just holding it for Jin Dong while she tied her shoe”.      Once it was second nature to lie to my parents about smoking, it became just as easy to lie to myself about it.     I can quit any time I want.         I just do it to calm myself down.           It relaxes me.          It’s just a habit.          The list could go on forever.  It kept me in the cycle of addiction for decades until one day I called it out for what it was:  Pure Bulls&@t!      Not only are the health benefits endless when you quit, but it’s incredibly liberating to stop lying to yourself and others.     P.S.  The names in this story have been changed to protect the innocent.
Great post BKP...   I was 11 years old ...I lied for years ...to my parents....it was that long ago now ...I carnt remember them...I smoked then for 52 years ...   At that age you dont expect to be a smoker all your adult life ...if someone had told me that at 11 ,I would have thought they were barmy....   Like you my friend the biggest lie was telling myself ,it was my reward ....I enjoyed it ...I could stop when ever I wanted ... All Lies...killing myself slowly ,is not a reward ....I didn't enjoy it ...I was hooked ...a addict... I can quit anytime I want .....I prooved that lie,with my million attempts to quit and fail...
Very few smokers gave you that answer, i just dont care. There is a cycle with addicts. With serious drugs or other issues they will go way passed the lying and manipulate you to feeling sorry for them.      55 minutes ago, BKP said:               The list could go on forever.  It kept me in the cycle of addiction for decades until one day I called it out for what ﻿it was:  Pure Bulls&@t!     https://www.narconon.org/blog/drug-addiction/vicious-cycle-addiction/
I was raised in a very strict upbringing.  I would have never gone against my parents.  I graduated high school on a Friday and started my first secretarial job the following Monday.  I felt so free and like an adult.  I remember my first pack.  I sat and smoked it at lunch break thinking I was so cool looking and finally a free adult.  That was at age 18.  It did not take long for the rosy glow to fade.  I married at 21 and had my first child at 22.  I could not stop.  I smoked through both my pregnancies and had low birth weights and two miscarriages.   I was so ashamed, I would only smoke at home and not in public.  I lied to everyone.  I would even lie to my doctor, who probably knew.  My friends would often say I smelled like smoke but I would say they are crazy.      I think one of the reasons we feel so empowered after quitting is because we can finally be true to ourselves and everyone else.     Edited January 10 by Linda Thomas
    Nice post LT 
I was always out of the closet with smoking,    didn't lie about it, didn't care.   I 'LOVED' smoking. I smoked everywhere. Smoking and I were like white on rice, inseparable for 40 something years.  I didn't trouble myself about it.   Quit while pregnant, resumed after the birth.       Then, a bit over five years ago, it dawned on me that I was just like a junkie. I hated junkies,    (even threw Tim Hardin out of my house for shooting up in my bathroom). I knew nothing about addiction.     I quit on a whim and lurked here and there,     immersing myself in an education about nicotine and nicotine addiction.     With information,  I understood the lies, the lies and the denial.  It strengthened my resolve. I

    The first couple days i had a lot of trouble sleeping, but it's been better tha past two days. But i am still having a weird sense that time is off. it doesn't feel like morning, for instance. is this normal for quitting?
    I think it's normal for winter, quitting or not lol. But there is a lot of brain fog in the early weeks of quitting so this could be why you're feeling that way too....
All normal C ...    Our bodies are all over the place ....glad your sleeping ...I never slept for weeks....was on the board 24/7.....keep going ...
You might want to go through Joel's Video Index you will learn a lot of things about nicotine addiction and be able to put yourself at ease knowing what happens or, what can happen.   Here is one I found for youDisorientation That May Occur When Quitting SmokingEdited January 11 by Sazerac
    In one hour, it will be three days of this quit. Trying to make this one forever. I slept a bit better last night. need to cut down on coffee and snacks
Good for you getting through day 3 C12! Remember, focus just on today and for today alone you won't smoke  Don't take on too much in the early days of your quit. Remember, rewards are important for getting through the day as a non-smoker. If that happen's to be snacking, so be it. It you gain a little weight, you can address that later once your quit is secure. For the coffee - yeah, try to replace that with something else if you can. Maybe a decaf coffee or, fruit juice would be a great substitute too. Keep going Christine
    You're doing great so far Christine, I agree with reci don't worry about the snacking or coffee right now. Focus on one thing at a time  
Day 3 will become Day 4 and will be another day to celebrate.  Daily victories add up.  Keep it going!!!
    Great job christine!      
    Each day is a great accomplishment and congratulations on your three days of Freedom.   Your body begins to repair and you settle in and get stronger every day.    Since you mentioned caffeine, you might find this vid from our friend, Joel, interesting.    
    Hey girl you are a day ahead of me and  Doing great, Yes it is still up hill but you have a Full head of Steam and are rolling strong !
    Here we go after getting my hindny kicked, I am back,   Lets Do it !     
    You should get plenty of help support opah! Not many new quitters yet on the year.... Get-em rock!                   
    This is your year Opah, you can succeed  
    You know the drill.  You know what to expect.  You know it can be terrible the first days or weeks.  We know you want this. Hunker down & get ‘er done this time. I know you can!!!! 
Getting long in the Day, it feels like the air in my lungs is heavy.  Been nidling on some tangerine slice and my Ricola drops. I am good and not in danger of smoking, I cant smoke what I don't have.  But really getting the urge crawl into bed and pull the blankets over my head and peek out at the TV.  Home is safe, never smoked in side and very seldom outside it is and has been my NO SMOKING ZONE.   2.5 hours I'll be on my way.   until then Deep breathes and two, three or so ricolas.    I need some wethermans hard carmel drops.
    OK its minutes now, Carl is in and just for a second I thought smoke break, hopefully I will help Carl in his quest for a smoke free life.  But for now its all about me me  ME, this is all my time at least for three weeks.  So Thank you all for your support today, and I will see you tomorrow.    
    Excellent news, Opah! Get some beauty sleep.    You are doing great, congratulations on your second day.    Tomorrow is another day to be free.
    G,day   well your back... good stuff.   Wish I could distill what makes a quit  a final one. I should,I’ve (lost) (had) a few.  Get yourself free of the smokes then work on if you think your a smoker or an addict.   chris        
Thank you Chris and Good day to you !  3rd day started and felling better on the drive into work.  Time for some coffe. I have work waiting so it will be a busy good morning for my quit
I anticipated the forum to be flooded with newbies.  I applaud those that have reclaimed their lives and health- vowing to kick the addiction in the 'butt' in 2019.  I'm standing here in peddle pushers/capris/waders- waiting for the tide to roll in with a mass of new quitters.  I'm taking the sunshine route- less smokers in the world these days (hallelujah!) so fewer folks will quit; therefore, less activity on forums like QT.          Are you still smoking?  You're a smoker.        Want to quit this year?  You're a wannabe.      Stop smoking cigarettes right now.  You will become an ex/former smoker-one of the greatest titles ever! Edited January 11 by Lust4Life

I’d rather get people off crack,” Dr. Louis De Palo, Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Moneyish. “The recidivism rate is huge because it’s not just the nicotine. If you really want to be successful, you have to look at everything that one stick is giving you, which is why a combination of nicotine replacement and cognitive behavioral therapy has shown the most success.” Medication plus counseling doubles a smoker’s chance of quitting, according to U.S. Public Health Services        “Smoking is not a ‘bad habit’ — smoking is an addiction, and this is how it has to be treated,” said Cindy Mendoza, health educator and tobacco specialist at Montefiore Medical Center.            Smoking costs you more than $27,000 a year. Here’s your no B.S. guide to quitting for good. By Nicole Lyn Pesce
    Brrrr. Feeling chilled and it's after dinner. The combination makes me want to bundle up and go outside to smoke. Also have a headache, which is rare for me. Increases desire to smoke.    It's strong, so I'm resorting to my tactic of brushing my teeth, taking the dog for her poop-walk, and going to sleep.  Brrrrrrrrrr. Craaaavvvve.   Feeling chilled a trigger for anyone else?
    Hi Kate, isn't it weird what triggers a crave? I got my worse craves when I was super happy about something or my asthma was acting up!     You're doing so great and that weird crave gets weaker and weaker the more you get past it. Soon it will be just a fleeting thought that goes as quickly as it comes 
The cold never brought on a crave for me but some triggers for cravings to light up are individually unique and others are pretty commonly shared. There are so many things our brain associated with smoking that it really does take a while to experience them all and get through those situations. That's why they say you need to get through all 4 seasons to experience all your triggers. Keep going. You're doing great and almost at 1 whole month! That's fantastic
Kate,   Craves will continue to pop up especially the first year.   Many are seasonally related (Winter chill, the burst of Spring etc.).   These are the receptors in your brain that have made associations with Nicotine.    Do not fear any crave, all you have to do is breathe through it.    As someone said, as we all repeat, "A Crave Is Not A Command".  It is just another receptor to wrench away from Nicotine    and look how splendid you are doing !   an hour from 28 days ?  Beautiful !Edited January 9 by Sazerac
    It is strange , the things that bring on craves. For me one is staying in Hotels. I know it sounds strange since you cannot smoke in most of them , but we've stayed in two the last month and a half and after we get settled in and pour a drink I really would like to go out and have one. It passes quickly but it's been about the only time I really have a stronger crave. This scares me as well because we are going on another cruise in April and I told my wife last night that has me worried even though I haven't really struggled much lately. There is something about setting there with a drink in your hand , soaking in the sun , listening to the Caribbean music and looking out across the Ocean while enjoying a smoke.  She said she would hurt me if that happened...promises, promises , I told her. But seriously, that has me more concerned  than any time since I've quit.  I'll make it through but just thinking ahead.
@Wantsit by the time your cruise comes you'll have three more months quit under your belt and you'll probably be pleasantly surprised at what a difference those months make. Most have found that the anticipation was way worse than the actual event that led to it. You're doing so well that I have a feeling you'll be just fine come April. And if you do find yourself craving just remember the air cigarette, the cleanest cigarette you'll ever "smoke". Edited January 10 by jillar

Start to think about all the improvements to your "fun time" when you get to that cruise next April  You won't have to pack a carton of smokes and worry about having an extra lighter as a back up just in case. You won't be pushing your wife aside trying to get out the airport doors for that much needed smoke when you arrive at your cruise port by air. You won't have to huddle in that "smokers area" on the ship's deck and feed your addiction. Huddled there with so many other addicts all puffing away while non-smokers stroll by and casually look over at the poor addicted fools. No more travelling half the ship to get up to that smoker's place on deck first thing in the morning while others run the jogging path around you, getting their morning fix or oxygen and exercise.      Oh, sorry for blathering on and on about all the benefits you'll enjoy as a non smoker on your cruise in April. Now, what was it that you thought you might be missing out on?Wantsit. You'll be just fine with all this by April. Just wanted to give you some things to focus on up till then. Yes. your mind will think about the old smoker you facing a new non smoking environment for the first time but you may just be surprised at how your quit strengthens, rather than weakens, when you go on that Caribbean Cruise. In fact; I'm so convinced of this I'm going to prove it to you. I'm going to go on a Caribbean Cruise for you and report back later on how it went  If I'm gone for then next while, you'll know where I'm at.

They walk through there with their noses in the air and fanning their hands acting as though they are going to pass out. It makes you want to say...GO AROUND! LOL! This year I will get to set with all the stuck up people on the other side. Did you ever notice that? The nonsmokers always seemed  a little snootier on the other side of the ship. Maybe spending time over there will lift me up to their level! After all...I am a non smoker right now.   Thank you for shedding a different light on this for me!
    You know what I found was that Yes, I would pass by the "smoker's corner" and look at them but all I felt was pity for them and happiness for myself not to have to be stuck there with them any longer hiding away while I got my fix. As a former smoker and now a non smoker, you will have a unique perspective on this. You won't be sticking up your nose at them because you understand way more that the never-smokers do about just what these people are up against.
    You're right recip-I'm not that type of person and wouldn't act that way to begin with. And I do like you said , know what it's like and do not want to be there. I am finding this out with my wife. After all these years of being together this is separating us at times . I do feel sorry for them because it just plain sucks. 
    Well, when I smoked, my wife had already quit long ago and when we went on a cruise, I just wandered off every now and again to get my fix. Didn't bother either one of us although, it should have bothered me that she had quit years ago and I didn't until recently. Now, I still wander off ..... just not to the smoking place 
    i mean to quit this time        how long does it take before i can start feeling normal again?
            To be honest, christine,    this is a journey of self-discovery, a boost of self-confidence and learning how to be a smoke free person. The physical withdrawals can last for months to include the great smoke free fog,   the rest is un learning and understanding the pattern of addiction.     Each receptor in your brain needs to be re-booted.  Give it a year, give it the rest of your life.  It won't be as crazy as it is now, you are in the thick of it   and it gets better with each crave you beat.    Each moment, day, each week, each month, each year brings more and more benefits for you to enjoy.      Hang on to your resolve and educate yourself, read till your eyes bleed.    You are doing the best work on the planet,  putting your addiction to sleep !       Congratulations on you second day of Freedom.   Tomorrow,  a whole lot of nicotine will have left your body and you are growing new cilia in your lungs as we speak.
    You can make it as hard or as easy as you choose to do. For me it was hard and took months but for others it was just a matter of they quit smoking and were done. But it does seem that the younger, more active quitters had an easier time of it.
    Regarding how long it takes to feel normal again, it varies for everyone.       Still, life as a smoker is not a normal life.  Our bodies were not created to inhale all of these deadly chemicals.  Try to think of it less as trying to feel normal and realize that you are in the process of healing yourself from the damage of smoking.       Don't light up again and things will get better with time.      I'm glad you are quitting again.
Congratulations on day 2 christine.  That's a big deal.         I would like to suggest that you don't focus so much on when you'll feel "normal" again, but that would make me a hypocrite.  I used to ask a friend at work every day when I would stop feeling so obsessed and deprived.  He kept giving me vague answers such as "It doesn't just happen overnight.  It will just evolve into better days".  I'd storm off, bemoaning the fact that he didn't give me a specific date.       But he was right.  It just takes time.  And there's no point in fixating on the magical date.  Focus more on the good you're doing for your body, mind, wallet, friends and family, etc.        P.S.  If you must have a target date, shoot for day 3 and get back to me tomorrow.
    One day at a time Christine. Don;t look beyond today in terms of your quit. Days will turn into weeks and weeks to months and you will gradually start feeling better and better about your new non smoking life. 
    As said above Christine this is a journey and you must take it one day at time, do not look beyond today -- keep that focus and you can get thru this.  As to normal, do not look at that, look at as each day an improvement over your days as a smoker!!!!
    Can only agree with all the above posts.... It doesn't really matter how long....its just about getting there....our brains can sometimes be our worst enemies...   Your a non smoker now...it's all about staying that way....this is done by taking it one day at a time....feel proud ....
Christine, it depends on what you think normal is.  Life is full of abnormal days.  Even finally succeeding in the quit, I don't feel normal.  I do feel, now that I can trudge through my abnormal life and not have to rely on smoking.  I am 5 mos. quit and I do still crave but I feel more in control and really empowered to see my quit through.    You are in the tough week.  I promise you will feel better as time goes on.
As some of you may know, we recently lost our two senior Corgis within a month of each other. As devastating as that was, I never once even thought about smoking.      Well, we decided our house was a bit too quiet, so say hello to Cooper.     While she is the most adorable thing I've ever seen, I've never been driven want to smoke (or drink) until we got her.

Why is quitting So hard by jwg » Wed Aug 29, 2012 4:01 pm   So that is the question , why is quitting so hard ? I think there is only one reason quitting it so hard to do  Or maybe two reasons , at most three to five ,, less then ten for sure..    Sadly I don’t think most here will agree with me nor will they aperciate my opion , and that really all this. My opion .    A view from my porch and from my experiences , nothing more So there that’s the warning , take it with a grain of salt  The reasons quitting is hard to do  First off its hard because ,, You want it to be! And yes I think that is true most people want quitting to be the hardest thing thay have ever done in there life,,,WHY ?   So they can then justify in there mind why on earth they smoked for so long,, after all if quitting was “easy” they would feel like quite the heal for not quitting years ago.  So in order to live with them self in a balance of peace , quitting must then be difficult. Plus with quitting being so hard to do, it gives the quitter a boost in there personal moral on how “hard” they fought and won ..   The quitter wants quitting to be hard to do , so they do not have to    Accept loved ones could have prevented there suffering and death if they could have easily quit.    And then there is the aspect of quitting is “so hard to do” because they have been told it was for years , and like the sentence above , have even been to the funerals that proved this to be true.    If you want to quit smoking and fit in with others who quit smoking , then by god you have to suffer threw it just like they did too. After all no one gets a free pass when it comes to quitting smoking ,,    “The hardest thing in the world to do”  Well to each there own , but it all honesty . to stop smoking is not that hard to do it at all , In fact NO ONE that ever really wanted to Quit Smoking has ever failed..   To stop smoking dose not cause pain , where as healing from most other things in fact dose , A sun burn carries with it much greater pain then any one ever suffered to stop smoking.   Mentally, a spelling test is harder then it is to quit smoking ..   And lastly, why quitting is so hard to do ? , because before most ever start they go into already granting them selfs permission to fail. And then this failure only dose one thing , grants them permission once more ,    So this goes back to my point , quitting is only hard because most just want it that way.   But I know first hand , that dose not have to be the way it is and in fact if focused on the rewards vs the discomforts , quitting hands down is the easiest thing any one has ever done for them selfs If smoking is a temp pleasure with long term consequences   Then to stop is is temp discomfort with long term benefits  Break the cycle , evaluate your quit honestly with out the desire for it to be “so hard” and not only will you see it is not as you have been lead to believe , but too you will learn to enjoy the process of becoming free to do all the things you once sat around and labeled   “one of these days” `jwg`
    Thanks @jillar for keeping these wise words and sharing them.. Perfect timing to for some of us too.
    Respect to jwg....but I disagree with some of this post.  Quitting was HARD for me.  Despite knowing all the slogans        It's only as hard as you make it out to be          It's temporary...you'll get over it in a few minutes            You need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative         Etc, etc.       My gut was in a knot for the first several months.  My brain was unable to focus.  It really was the hardest thing I've ever done (and I've been through some pretty serious sh/t).     But regardless of that, when things got really tough, I was able to keep going on sheer determination.      I want any newbie who's feeling distress to know that not everyone can dismiss the discomfort simply by thinking it's not hard or adopting a new mindset.  You can do it in spite of it being hard.     So, whether it's hard or easy, the bottom line is it's doable.  Just because something is difficult doesn't mean you shouldn't do it or it's not worth fighting for.  Eventually the hardships diminish.  One day the thought of "Quitting was hard" will be replaced with "Quitting was smart".

Grit your teeth and power though those times and they will diminish in time and become less frequent and you'll find yourself in such a much batter place   Now go camping like you said! Which place are you camping at? Hilton, Best Western? Hampton Inn's not bad too

Sorry to hear you are having so much trouble quitting C12  Are you drinking lots of water and fruit juice to help blood sugar levels? Those may help with the sleep disorder but, sleep pattern interruption is pretty common for many while quitting.   Are you quitting cold turkey or are you using NRT products?     Reading all you can about nicotine addiction to understand how it affects your brain and your body is crucial to forming a long lasting quit. There's a ton of Joel videos here too that will address specific situations that may be of interest to you.

    Sorry you lost your quit again Christine. I stayed glued to the forum for my whole first year. I found reading, supporting, celebrating and socializing really helped keep my mind off my misery. You also should be posting an SOS whenever you feel yourself caving to a crave. I did and my quit was saved at least twice. No shame in doing it if it means your forever quit right?!

I failed and failed until i had the right mindset... Don't quit quitting...  https://whyquit.com/pr/111909.html
Hi C 12,  it is good that you are posting.  We know you truly want to quit.  I think if you can just get yourself through the first week, the craves are much more manageable.  Like Reciprocity said, you might try NRT or talk with your doctor.  I also found it helpful to stay close to the forum and read everything you can.  We are here to help guide you through this, just shout out!
Don't forget about the SOS page either please! This is a life saver in the early days if things become overwhelming. Just post up and peeps will come running to talk you off the ledge (so to speak)  Edited January 8 by reciprocity

    Hello Christine,    I am a cold turkey success story.   It was easier for me to just DO IT  rather than deal with NRTs. You must embrace the suck no matter what method you choose to quit, it is a serious deadly addiction and the only real choice is to     NEVER SMOKE AGAIN.  Sure, you will have discomfort but, so what....the rewards far outweigh any distress.   Please educate yourself,    commit to yourself and protect your quit.   You Will Succeed.
Repeat what the chick above said.       I grabbed the word NOPE. I said it 100000 times a day. If I never took a puff I couldn't fail.      also like A puff away from a pack a day.        keep Marching
Sometimesit takes every last bit of you to keep your balanceand not do something self destructive.I'm not talking about willpower, I'm talking aboutsomething else.I'm not sure how to describe it.It's like the part of you that wants to live,the part of you that is committed to not smoking,is connected by only the most slender of threads tothe part of you driving the car,making the decisions. Sometimes you just hang in there,a minute at a time. You ask for help, but you knowif you choose toyou can turn away from that pretty easily,or even accidentallyon purpose. Sometimesnot sliding backwardscounts as moving forwards.Sometimes not actively trying to die isliving large.Sometimes holding your groundis a fragile miracle.
Very well said Julie! 
Beautiful Julie
This is so true.
Wonderful, thoughtful post, Julie!

YES! We have a few around here now so stay with us Newbies! Take things a day at a time and stay true to that commitment you made to yourself not too long ago. It will happen if you just don't smoke - not even one puff is the road to freedom. Stay active here because as the days turn into weeks, you will need people who truly understand what you are going though. Those people will underpin your quit foundation for you as you continue to build your permanent quit.Edited January 8 by reciprocity

    Freedom !!! That Sense of shame....noticing how some folks looked at me...when I was standing in a door way ...to get my fix ....   What does it mean to you ?????
    I had the same shame Doreen.  I hid my smoking.  Once I quit working, I just stayed home.  I am free now to go out and live my life!
Self respect... I didn't think much of myself before I quit... and while I'm still a work in progress I certainly have way more respect for who I am now than I did this time 13 moths ago.
    Strength ...I feel more stronger now in every aspect of my life ....I can cope better ...more calmer ....
    Not worrying about running out of cigarettes!
    Freedom from being a smoker in front of my daughter. 
    So many things!! Stronger, smarter, healthier, freer(more free),calmer,more productive, more focused, less distracted.......
    No longer tethered to the tobacco industry, fine fellows that they are (not).
    Cigarettes were going to kill me.  If I could get free, I might live.  
    At first I thought quitting was about a healthier lifestyle and saving money but now, a year later; it's being rid of all the BS that goes along with the actual act of smoking that I am happiest to be rid of. Being able to control my own life and not having to run my life in accordance to a nicotine addiction's demands.
    My confidence has soared since I quit smoking.  I have control of my life once again.  It still amazes me how much effort I put into smoking.  My entire day was wrapped around when I would smoke.  I craved my next cigarette before I had even put out the one I was currently smoking.  I mistakenly believed quitting was too difficult.  It wasn't too difficult. Smoking was difficult.  I am so thankful for the life I have now and I would not trade this freedom for anything.  
    Yes, smoking truly is difficult! Very much so   ..the planning. covering the stench....breath, hair, clothes,  truck etc        So much time wasted, so many things missed....the LIE !!
    Not worrying if the next one ,would start cancer....the fear has gone ....
    No more huddling under a tree, trying to keep from getting rained on and trying to keep rain from drowning my cigarette.    (I only smoked outdoors)    No more looking at my month-end budget and expenses, and how smoking was keeping me from saving money.      It's also giving my willpower a workout. Saying "no" hundreds of times to urges to smoke; saying "yes" to exercise and meditation.   
    I had shame too, Doreen.  Now, I live life without pause.  Sure, I need a break. A mental break not a smoke break. I confused the two for many years.       I shamed myself into quitting after having a family vacation at a popular theme park. I missed too much because of the addiction.       So, I quit.  For that & many other reasons.          
    In all honesty,  at this point freedom still means hard work! If not debunking addict thoughts, it's accepting where I'm at... exercizing radical patience.... believing that whatever comes my way, I'll be in good shape to handle it without burning something so I can inhale the smoke...      On the bright side, I believe that these are all qualities that I'll benefit from for the rest of my life! 
    G﻿’day﻿ ﻿﻿  well it﻿ t﻿hat time of the day, time to think about smoking....     NOPE ﻿﻿ thats it, all done, ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿till to﻿morr﻿ow m﻿orning   C﻿﻿﻿﻿
Freedom, for me, has been so surprisingly generative.  During my quitting process, I developed skills that continue to help me when I face difficult circumstances, and frankly I never would have predicted that I would continue to reap the (non-physical) benefits so long after I was able to extinguish the associations and cravings related to smoking.         Christian99 17 Years Quit

    A new benefit I just realized today.  My skin is not as dried out.   I used to get those painful skin cracks on the tips of my fingers, especially in the winter months, but this morning I realized I hadn’t had one since I quit smoking
    Here is a vid from our friend, Joel, about 'how to do nothing w/out a smoke.                This part of quitting was hard for me.  In-between tasks or taking breaks I would usually sit on my back stoop and  think about what to do next or just look at my garden...that light on that leaf.    I thought I needed a smoke to do this   but, I didn't need a smoke. I needed the break, I needed some nice deep breaths of oxygen, I needed a moment to collect my thoughts.        Smoking was non essential and facilitated nothing but bondage.   
^^ Yes, yes, yes....that was me also! Although I would sit on my front patio!  It was difficult for me that first spring and summer of my 2017 Quit but I worked through it gradually and before I knew it the trigger was gone!!!
    Thanks for posting this. I am struggling with this a LOT. 
    yep, mrsguest it is hard.   I felt like jumping out of my skin  but, taking breaths (oxygen became my new drug of choice)   peeling a satsuma and enjoying that delicious-ness  helped me a lot. Also WATER.  Water water water !   And throwing any kind of distraction my way, jumping jacks, screaming showers etc.  I would sit and sketch or write just to give my fingers something to do.@jillar  made a fake smoke with just a straw and sucked on that.        Believe us, mrsguest, it gets better.  You won't feel terrible forever, I promise.  Each crave you beat reclaims a receptor in your brain.       
    Oh yes my best friend was my JAC (jillars air cigarette) except I didn't use a straw or pen like many others had. Mine was invisible and I never had to worry about forgetting it anywhere lol.  
    I had to keep my mind busy ...jigsaws ...crosswords ...playing candy crush ....ect....  I didn't even know how to be a adult without my crutch....  But everytime I did  something without a smoke ...it got easier ....we have to retrain  our brains .... Maybe start a new hobby...a few here have took up knitting ....knit a scarf....make it as long as you like ....
    I've been putting together lots of jigsaw puzzles! 
    I sucked on cinnamon sticks like Jillars Air Smoke
    Oh my go to candy was soft peppermint puffs. I bought by the bucket that first six months or so lol.    So my fellow Jill, I occupied my mind by staying glued to the board. I found that reading posts, supporting others, celebrating milestones, socializing and playing games really helped keep my mind off my misery 
    I've been on dum-dum suckers! when you save the wrappers you can play a game online and win stuff. I've collected a few lol
    Hey! Whatever works to keep cigarettes out of your mouth is a good thing, right?    You're doing great! Keep moving forward because it will get easier the more time you invest in yourself and your quit   
I struggle with this too. I now take my dog for 3 walks a day, ha! I work from home and I would go outside for a cigarette break every hour. Now I just go outside and look around at the neighborhood and take deep breaths. This doesn't cause cravings but I need the break. The association with smoking is getting weaker.
    G’day   My little saviour was a packet of tic tags. Just like a cig packet, I had something to carry around and worry about losing. I got to check the packet to make sure I wouldn’t run out before I could restock.   Most important I could allow myself a little reward inside a building even among non smokers! And it was socially except able to offer them around. My blind friend got to recognise me by the fruity smell rather than the stinky smoke smell.     I still keep a packet in my car... they are still my reward for staying calm in traffic without OD ing on to much sugar!

I saw on the NOPE thread that our friend, @Tammy    had bad smokey dreams last night.   It is always horrible to realize how deep out addiction goes.   Our subconscious is ripe ground and it takes time to purge. It is a wake up call to how entrenched addiction is.    But, there is also a physical reason, it is about the cilia in our lungs removing tar.      Joel says interesting things about Dreams in this video,    how the cilia are continuing to clean up while we sleep which may generate smells and taste of tobacco and trigger the dream.               Should you want to delve deeper into the psychology of this, here is a study on PDF.Dream of Absent-Minded Transgressiohttps: An Empirical Study of a Cognitive Withdrawal  Abstract    Among 293 smokers abstinent for between 1 and 4 weeks, 33% reported having at least 1 dream about smoking. In most dreams, subjects caught themselves smoking and felt strong negative emotions, such as panic and guilt. Dreams about smoking were the result of tobacco withdrawal, as 97% of subjects did not have them while smoking, and their occurrence was significantly related to the duration of abstinence. They were rated as more vivid than the usual dreams and were as common as most major tobacco withdrawal symptoms. In subjects abstinent for 1 year, 63% recalled having dreams about smoking. They had on average 5 of them, and about a quarter occurred after the 6th month of abstinence. Having dreams about smoking was prospectively positively related to maintenance of abstinence. An explanation of this finding based on the association of smoking in dreams with aversive emotions is offered.  Edited January 7 by Sazerac
Only had 2 smoking dreams after quitting.  The first was at 3 weeks and the other at 6 months.  Nothing since.  I do recall the immense sense of disappointment that I had failed my quit immediately upon awakening....and the tremendous relief when I realized it was only a dream.  To me this was more evidence that smoking was a consuming thought, even subconsciously, for several months after I quit.        P.S. The first dream I was in bed smoking and all of my coworkers were sleeping on the floor, face down and butt naked.  A legitimate nightmare for sure.

Lovely post 
Wow...you just nailed it!  Awesome post, Julie!
and......PRINTING!
I owe parts of it to a friend who wrote me something similar when I was getting clean and sober. She isn't with me anymore. She relapsed and we've lost touch. I hope she's ok wherever she is and I know she wouldn't mind me tweaking and adding to her letter if it was going to help someone else. So, wherever you are Shannon.....thank you.
Brilliant, I love it. Sad and funny and true. A shot right to the heart, ((Jules))
yes, really, you just don't.  and we stand by you, because we can and always will, and you just don't. What happens is you look in a mirror and know a number of people are smiling behind you. You know you deserve more and so do your friends. and so you don't. xx

Bump
hi to everyone that remembers me from a while ago, just a quick note to say that I am still not smoking even after coming up against most of the excuses available to us. ie. pub,holidays,birthdays,funerals,stressed,peer pressure etc.Been through all of them and not smoked, so for anyone just starting out, its hard, but don't think it cant be done. Smoking ruled my life for over 30 years and now I am coming up to 2years not smoking. There is no tip I can give anyone other than what some of the wiser people here have said to me and many others, and that is to not light a cigarette and take a puff of it.Do whatever you need to get through the initial cravings, just don t smoke.My younger sister is trying to give up now,and names me as an inspiration. She s called me many things over the years, but never that, so I am taking that one, and feel quite proud. Good luck anyone starting out, and well done those still going. Pedro
    Woohoo.... how great does it feel to be an inspiration to someone!      Oh @reciprocity ... you need to squeeze another Lido woohoo welcome party into the January Calendar... dunno what was in the water last January but these boys are showing us en mass just how this quit thing is done.
    Hey Pedro !!!.....good to hear from you ....    Good for you ,playing it forward and showing your sister the way ....x
Great to hear from you @pedro68! Of course I remember you. You quit just a couple weeks before I did. That's another great point you make about your sister and how she's looked to you for her own inspiration to quit. The pride of accomplishing this goes on and on  Congrats on 2 Years Pedro. On to 3 years now
    Congratulations Pedro ! How wonderful you have been an inspiration for your sister, that is grand.
    Congratulations Pedro, two years quit is AWESOME! 
    Congratulations Pedro!  That is awesome!
C'mon, smile.  You always look so serious.      I used to hear those lines all the time, for over a decade.  And there was a good reason.  I kept my mouth closed like a vise (vice for you Brits).  It all started when I was 39 and I made a routine trip to the dentist.  He did that thing where he pushed a tool under my gums at each tooth and called out a number.  5, 7, 7, 9, 8, 5, 9, 8, etc.  Apparently high numbers (on a scale of 1-10) were bad.        "We're going to have to extract 4 teeth today and send you to a periodontist.  You probably have some hereditary periodontal disease, but smoking for decades is likely the biggest contributor".       WTF!  I had used a Sonicare toothbrush ever since they first came out.  At least twice a day.  I flossed and used a Waterpik every evening.  But those tools were not powerful enough weapons to combat the damage smoking was doing to my mouth.  The sad thing is, I continued to smoke for another decade.  And the problems grew worse.  4 bridges, 2 crowns, and receding  gum lines that made my teeth look twice as long as normal.  My solution was to never smile.         Long story short, I had to have all my teeth removed last year.  Had to choose between dentures ($10K out of pocket) or full implants ($47K out of pocket).  I chose the later, and am happy with the aesthetic result, but it will never feel the same as my real teeth and I'll be paying off the implants for years.     I know there are much more serious consequences to smoking out there.  Cancer, heart disease, COPD, etc.  But I just wanted to bring up one of the not so obvious damages that may occur as a result of long term smoking.  Please throw this on your pile of concerns if you're young and considering quitting now.        The good news is, I've never felt better since I quit smoking, and I now have good reason to smile about my life of freedom.
I am a toothless wonder, too, BKP ! For sure, smoking had a lot to do with it   and combined with hereditary issues...  my gnashers didn't stand a chance.      You look great, BKP.         Edited January 3 by Sazerac
Me too!  I tell my husband my diamonds are all in my mouth.  I do have genetics that played a huge part but know smoking did not help.  I spent many years trying to save my teeth, with gum surgery, root canals and crowns.  Finally a dentist told me my teeth were not in the bone and just floating.   Options - $50,000 to surgically go in and wire them all together or $27,000 to have them removed, with three implants to hold the teeth on the bottom.  Insurance would not even pay for the removal of the teeth.      I chose the second option.  I still had to have bone and skin graphs for the implants.      It was all very painful and expensive.      My original two front teeth were crooked.  The dentist asked me if I wanted to keep that with false teeth.  I thought he was nuts.  I wasn't going to pay all that money to have crooked teeth. Needless to say, I hate my teeth now.  I can not get used to them not being crooked.  That must have been my character!     You do look wonderful BKP.  They may have been expensive but a much better option and more like your own teeth.           Edited January 3 by Linda Thomas
    Thank you for sharing that BKP, gum disease is serious. My aunt didnt smile and told nobody her situation, one day she was sick and couldnt chew from what i saw. I asked her to open her mouth and she was hesitant and when she finally let me see THERE WAS ONLY ONE MOLAR IN HER MOUTH! She had her front teeth (all stained from smoking) but had all the rest pulled and she didnt have the money and didnt ask about options (depression) for a solution.
    Smile... you look great     I had peridontal disease too, still got all my teeth , but had extensive cleaning done over several sessions and cost lots of ££££££££££££££££££££/s   again caused by smoking.

I have bad genetics, long term effects of chemotherapy AND smoking.   I have had root canals, crowns, and eventually extractions.   I have two implants on the lower left side that holds a three tooth bridge (a process that took 6 months but was worth it).   I have a traditional bridge on the lower right side along with several crowns on the upper teeth.     I think I have spent more money on my teeth over the years than my regular doctor.      Model of what my implant/bridge looks like.     Quick edit.  When I was 18 and and just started chemo, my oncologist said I need to get to the dentist for a checkup and stay on top of any issues.   My Mom thought dental care was the least of my problems and wanted to put it off.   We then got a lecture on the effects of chemo and dental health, which could lead to complications during treatment.Edited January 4 by Wayne045
    Yup. I too have had issues with my teeth due to smoking.  Having some grafting done later this year....Gums have just receded so much.  Thank God implants are an option now but damn, that's expensive.

Thank God implants are an option now but damn, that's expensive.                Yes they are.  Plus it's a long, multi-step process, Your regular dentist has to make molds of your teeth.   Then dental surgery to remove the dead tooth or teeth (if you still have them) and put in the implant(s), then a 5-7 month wait while your bone and jaws heal.  Then the posts are put on followed by your normal dentist to attach the bridge.        If you can afford it though, it is definitely worth it.
    This was one of greatest fears, losing my teeth. I've realized my gums have receded.    A man I know, someone who works near me has only a few random teeth. Stained teeth. I don't know how or what he eats. He's very thin. He smoked for decades. Then his doctor told him he could expect to die in a year or so or quit smoking.  He quit cold turkey. Says he misses it nearly every day  but won't go back.
Additional Data Point: While you can never reverse the damage of periodontal disease, it can be halted in its tracks.   One day,  unexpected and out of the blue, the nice hygeinist lady asked "Has anyone talked with you about ... <erie pause> ... Periodontal Disease ... Mr. The Sarge ?" ... "Uhhhhh ... nope ..."   Progressed for 3 years. Had to have the ol' under-the-gumline root planing / deep scraping.  Twice. Next up: Surgery. They basically cut the gums away from the jawbone, roll 'em outa the way, and go to town on the teeth roots.  Yikes!      Fast forward 2 years:  Quit smoking.    Active Gum Disease all but disappeared.     Gums returned to pink, and plump, and healthy.  No sign of active disease for the past 5 years.     There's still the bone loss and receeded gums ... but it's stable. No change in half a decade.  They even quit measuring and reading out the numbers (Sarge wasn't quite as bad - highest of 5 (2,2,4,3,5,4,5 3.3....) ) at every appointment because they were no longer changing progressing. Two changes were made: (1) Flossing twice daily - whether needed or not (previously Sarge only flossed when a hunk o' something was stuck up in there) ... and (2) quitting the cancer-sticks.  Dentist could neither confirm nor deny which had a larger benefit, but the two together cinched the deal.   Quit smoking, folks.    Your future teeth will thank you.   Sarge had perfectly sound, healthy, good teeth that would have fallen out of his head by now due to bone loss from the gum disease.     Now? Problem solved. Complete remission. No sign of active disease.     Sarge is certain he'd be in dentures by now if he hadn't quit.  EZPZ    PS: Your heart and arteries will love you, too. There's a funky correlation between gum disease and heart disease.
I'm fortunately out of the 5's and 6's but still have some 4s and need to get my teeth cleaned 3 or 4 times a year. I lost a tooth because it cracked and wasn't fixed in time for a root canal (long story). Whenever I have tooth pain I get trigeminal neuralgia symptoms that resolve when the problem is fixed but for that reason I elected not to get an implant so I just wear a partial denture for a few hours a day to stop the other teeth from moving. It is a back tooth and you cannot see it.       I use a water pick, an electric tooth brush and floss every day. I have been regularly going to the dentist for cleaning for the past decade and that has helped a lot to save my teeth. Smoking did a lot of damage to my gums and they have receded but are pretty healthy now for the most part.
The first of the year is a popular quit day.  Are you lurking here, counting down the days? If so, bravo!  Stay close to this site.   My last cigarette was 9/26/2016.  I know the angst, excitement, fear, determination, grief, etc that often accompanies a quit.  If your quit date is Jan 1 2019- you have time to prepare.  What is your plan?  What quit method best suits you? Cold turkey, patches, gum, meds...?  Then...what will you do when that first wave of a crave crashes over you? How about the next one that nearly drowns you?        I have had multiple failed quit attempts.  Maybe the reason I failed is because I was not honest w myself.  When I was honest w myself, I succeeded.  My honest mantra went something like this~ quitting sucks.  Quitting really sucks.  This sucks. It won’t suck like this forever.  I will not smoke today even though it really hurts. My head, my nerves, my whole being hurts.  Quitting sucks. Addiction sucks.  Quitting will not be easy.  I will not smoke today.  Play, rewind,repeat until the deed is done.       You can quit. You have support & resources here. Use them. You will quit.       Welcome to the other side!      -L4L
    Great post lust  I wanted to share that one preparation step I took was to stop smoking where I normally smoked so that when I quit I didn't associate those places with smoking.

I'm going for a run in the morning and will be regularly running alongside eating well. This is it for me. Onwards and upwards people. Good luck if you are also quitting and we'll done to everyone already quit.

Sharing my blog post here too because I feel in a "new year, new start" sort of mentality that it may speak to even one person.         I've umm'ed and ahh'ed about writing another blog entry, I don't like to be rushed I guess. I thought I was in  a new year and heading for my 4th year quit but on perusing the site, transpires I'm heading for my 5th lol. Smoking is an enigma to me now but those who knew my habit 2+ packs a day for years can't believe I have stayed quit *cough, this site* and new friends can't imagine me as a smoker! The latter is a compliment for sure.     However when I quit it was with two others. My Mum and my then boyfriend, now just one of my best friends. Both relapsed. Chris, my friend, smokes heavily again and has done for 4 years, no quit in sight. Sadly my Mum damaged herself too heavily and last May, 1 day before her 70th birthday, I stood at her bedside after the awful news she wouldn't make it - to talk her over to the other side. Our relationship had been fairly strained but I'm pleased we had marginally reconnected for a few months before she died of multiple organ failure - drinking and smoking were at the heart of it all, quite literally. I have the most awful memories and photographic evidence of me holding her hand and cuddling in as I was telling her to look for our loved ones...when we should have been preparing for her birthday.       If you have children and are on the fence then please consider that it isn't just you who suffers. Get educated and be real.        The quit itself is effortless now. I remember at times that I would have smoked here and smile that it means absolutely nothing, it simply a memory. My children are level 4 and 5 (red and green belt) at mixed martial arts where I used the money from quitting to put them in a club to train. I should really go to that gym I pay for more, oops, but I can still run faaarrrr better than I ever could as a smoker, even with the gaps in training haha. The quit bought me strength, joy and healthier finances....I have never looked back. I completely retrained myself with a new career and am happily teaching both Reiki healing and Tarot Cards that I trained in.      My point is the quit bought me nothing but good and joy. Those who didn't commit have a painful story attached.         Love to all. Marti. xx
Thanks Marti for your personal story.   You are 100% correct too. There's NO downside to quitting. Only good things in your future as a non smoker       And, Happy New Year to you!Edited January 2 by reciprocity

Not only did you build yourself a fine, sturdy quit but, you helped so many along the way.  I am one of those that benefited from your experiences and encouragement.   Thank you, baby, and have a splendid 2019.Edited January 3 by Sazerac
    Thanks a lot for sharing this. Sorry to hear about the passing of your mum and your friend's relapse.       I long so much for smoking being just a memory. I know that every day is part of the trip, but how I whish I could fast forward time and just be done with it!      Thanks again @Marti, this gives me hope. 
    I'm currently going through an internal battle of trying not to smoking  and lacking the motivation to stop; leaving me sooo frustrated and feeling like a failure in my loved ones' eyes. Is it possible to get some advices??
Hi Lia! Welcome to Quit Train. I see your quit date is Jan. 1, 2019 yet you say you are trying to not smoke now. Have you quit yet or are you just cutting down and plan to quit on New Years Day? What is you quit plan? Are you planning to use nicotine replacement products like the patch or nicotine gum or are you quitting cold turkey (no nicotine products)? Quitting is unpleasant in the early days because your body and mind will be going through a lot of changes but you will make it through like everyone does if you just make up your mind not to smoke. It takes an unwavering commitment on your part to quit - it's that simple. Hope to see you around the forum. Best wishes.
    Welcome to QuitTrain, Lia.  Quitting smoking is a truly great thing to do and your life improves greatly, in many ways, after quitting for good.        Learning about nicotine addiction is a big key to quitting.  The more you know about it, the more prepared you are to leave nicotine behind for good.  Read a lot in the "quit smoking discussions" part of this site.  There is a lot of good advice there regarding challenges people may experience during the early stages of their quits.   As reciprocity asked, are you currently smoking or planning on quitting on New Year's Day?
    Thank you for responding and your kind advice. No I haven't quit as yet.  My intention is quitting cold turkey by New Years Day but I'm just trying to get my mentality right currently (and cutting down) so I'll be able to go through the whole process successfully. I know I will succeed ; I just need to get my priorities straight.
    Welcome aboard Lia....  Spend the time ,before your quit date reading all you can here ...knowledge is what you fight this horrible addiction with ...  Learn all you can...    You will find plenty of great posts here...on the main board they are pinned with a green square....watch all Joels video,s....they cover more or less everything you wish to know ..   It's doable ....you have a train full of quitters ..who will tell you .....you can .....you just have to want it bad enough...  Life without a nicotine addiction is wonderful....the only way to find out ...is Quit .....

Hi Lia.  You will succeed.  All you have to do is stop smoking.  I smoked for 42 years and tried everything to quit, including help through my physician.  Nothing worked.  I was always searching for ways to quit and came across this forum.  I am now almost to my fifth month of not smoking.  This forum has all the information and a wonderful group of people ready to help guide you through and support you. Yes, the first week is a little tough, but doable.  Once the nicotine is out of your system, you just learn to redirect your brain when those craves pop up.    I look forward to helping you through this journey.
    Thank you Linda! I appreciate your support 
Lia welcome aboard, I am happy to see that you are planning to quit.  The best advice I can give right now is to thoroughly go thru this site and read everything you can prior to Jan. the 1st, this way you can build up your resolve and educate yourself.  Also go thru some of the posts that we all have been part of -- again a lot to gleam there.  Once you quit, lots of cold water to drink and deep breathing techniques then go to the daily NOPE pledge and post everyday -- it really helps.  Just remember we will be here for you!!!
Thank you Martian5!  I will continue doing your suggestions!

There is only one priority required to quit smoking and that is a commitment to never smoking another puff again.

As for "cutting down"...    You may find this interesting,  our friend, Joel, discusses quitting by gradual withdrawal (i.e. torture)Quitting by Gradual Withdrawal     Should you quit now, you will be 10 glorious days into your quit for the New Year ! Please, think about it.  Every day is the best day to quit !Edited December 22, 2018 by Sazerac
    Thank you Sazerac for sharing that information with me! I'm going through all of it right now 
Welcome Lia... stock up on juice... I kid you not it is a godsend.. @Sazerac explains it better but giving up nicotine affects your bodies ability to control blood sugar, its why so many quitters crave sugar... this effect is short term... but it doesn't help with the whole process... so you need to stay hydrated and you need to keep your blood sugar levels up... so drink juice.. 2 birds, 1 stone... it actually really helps.        I used NRT... because for me I knew that was my best option, I needed to break the emotional and habit side of the quit more than the physical side, past quits had taught me that was my biggest weakness the emotional addiction. That said I was very strict with my use of gum... and set a stringent timeline for me to get off it... what I can tell you is that it gave me the buffer I needed to break the habit/reflex side of my addiction before dealing with fully with the detox side. So that's the upside.. the down side is that in hindsight it drew it out when I finally gave up the NRT too (about week 9) I had a bit of a revist to the first few weeks of intensity... so it prolonged the hard physical stage. It worked for me, in hindsight I would like to say I would go cold turkey but cold turkey was not going to work for me. The thing is, everyone's quit is an individual experience and what works for one might not work for another.     If you can get a copy of it before your quit date you should read the Alan Carr book... I read it after I had quit and it was worth it then but it is a really helpful quit tool, especially if you are going cold turkey.      You can do this. You have total control over this, only you can pick up a smoke, put it in your mouth and set it on fire... only you control that... I am so looking forward to sharing your journey... read everything, ask questions, but most importantly just take it one day at a time... just focus on 24 hours... you can't change yesterday and tomorrow isn't here yet, just quit for one day at a time. Once you have one day, you know you can do it... and little by little each day gets easier.

My only problem with that though is that I've been on the ketogenic diet for the past month (so I haven't been intaking any sugar). I've been trying to overcome one of my biggest personal fears which is gain weight as it puts me in an intense, unhealthy depression. Unfortunately, I have mentally  attached smoking with weight loss/ weight maintenance. So I'm trying to break away from that dysfunctional correlation with a healthier way to lose weight.        However, I will start reading the Alan Carr book you also suggested! And I really do appreciate your delightful and encouraging words!

Just think of it this way "Does it make sense to destroy our health just to stay thin?"

When I quit, i cut back from 30 smokes and for three days, I allowed myself three cigarettes.   My quit date was set up for a Friday so I would have the weekend to suffer the initial shock. I do not work weekends. So my last smoke was right before i went to bed so I could wake up to a new life of not smoking.      That would be my advice. If you cannot quit today, then pick a date in the near future where you will have a couple stress free days, a couple days that you can go through the initial shock or whatever.      Just keep something in mind though. Some of us have different emotional triggers that make us want to light up. For some it is stress, for some it's boredom, and for some (like me) it is when we get excited or want to "celebrate" something.        If you are a "stress smoker", keep in mind that after the first is when companies want to "roll out" their biggest bullshit that is going to cause grief for the employees. If you can quit even a few days before THAT hits, all the better. At least you will have a few days of getting used to not smoking before that.
Welcome Lia and congratulations on deciding to quit this nasty addiction. I didn't pick a quit date but knew it was time to quit so one thing I did in preparation was to quit smoking in the place I normally smoked. Which for me was my garage. This totally helped me disassociate that area with smoking and I wouldn't get a crave when I was in there after I quit. Maybe start doing that?       Edited December 24, 2018 by jillar

If you smoke, that's your biggest problem and quitting needs to become your primary focus! It's the thing that puts your life, your very future, at risk! Smoking gives you nothing ..... makes nothing in your life better and will likely shorten your life.      Am I missing the "good things" smoking does for you? Right; there are none! You are just feeding an addiction - that's it, that's all!      We condition our brains to believe we are settling our anxiety by smoking in stressful situations when we are really just avoiding dealing with those situations while we feed our addiction. The relief we feel is because we needed that nicotine fix. Our real life problem is still there waiting for us.       This is why education about the addiction is SO important. Understanding what''s really going on. Once you do, you'll get it and your resolve to quit will be strengthened 10 fold! You CAN do it just like we all have

And I really do appreciate your delightful and encouraging words!          Hi Lia, I am about 12 days quit smoking and two or three days off of the nicotine patch. I wanted to first break the habit and then deal with the chemical withdrawal. It seems to have been a good strategy.   I weighed in at Weight Watchers at 220 about 13 years ago. Then over three years I lost weight and part of that was by smoking, not eating. I dropped to 145 lb, which is on the slim side for my height and age.   For ten years I kept it off, until I made a job change from an active to a sedentary one,  and then the weight began creeping back up. My biggest hurdle to quitting smoking was the fear of becoming obese again. I can't count the times I stopped smoking, then started in again because I was over eating and becoming clinically depressed.        Through reading and videos on YouTube by medical researchers, doctors, and nutritionists, I learned about eating a plant based diet and about extended fasting. Confidence in the information about the diet gives me confidence that I'll get my weight back to slim. (I'm actually barely at the "overweight" stage, I have about 18 lb to lose).     When I believed that my choice was smoking or obesity, I chose smoking, repeatedly. Just as learning about addiction makes it possible to quit smoking, I believe that learning lots about health and nutrition will make it possible to avoid long term weight gain.       Best of luck to you Lia. So many people have successfully quit smoking, that I know you can be a success story, as well. You've already got your goal in mind, and a strategy -- breaking  the dysfunctional correlation between smoking and weight maintenance. I know you'll develop the tactics to make your goal a reality. It'll be fun to hear your story along the way.
Lia here is an idea, it is how I managed to finally quit. Mine was in Oct 2017 though.  So New year's eve is on a Monday. If you do not work the weekend, that might mean you have a three day weekend. That will give you those first three and hardest days to suffer in peace without the stress of being at work.To clear your mind.    Three days might not seem like much but I believe if a smoker can make it THAT long with no nicotine/tobacco, he or she has proven to themselves they CAN do it so they can feed off that accomplishment as motivation.     Between now and Friday, maybe cut way back on smoking (I went from 30 a day to three a day) then Friday night before you go to bed, that will be your dead last cigarette. Also by that time, all your cigarettes, ash trays, and other smoking stuff should be gone. Give it away, throw it away, whatever. Saturday you wake up a non-smoker.     During those first three days, start cleaning everything you can. All laundry, bed sheets, walls, etc. You are done smoking at that point so might as well get it completely out of your life. Of course if you smoked only outside, it won't take as much cleaning.        Maybe you are scared to quit, like "Oh my god, how will I do it?" I remember thinking that but when I put out my final smoke and went to bed, the first day wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Most important, you have to want this quit. You have to demand it. You have to reach out and TAKE that quit. Push past every crave and temptation and be GREEDY with that quit that is yours. Do not let temptation have it.        If you are able to quit THIS day then even better but I was not able to just quit with no solid plan. Many decry the "cut back" method but for some of us it did work.  If you can make it even ONE complete day without smoking, like from wake-up to bed time again, you have just proven it IS possible to quit.         On 12/22/2018 at 11:18 AM, Linda Thomas said:               Hi Lia.  You will succeed.  All you have to do is stop smoking.  I smoked for 42 years and tried everything to quit, including help through my physician.  Nothing worked.          The reason stop-smoking drugs, patches, gums, getting stabbed with needles, hypnosis, whatever do not work is because if they DID, people would stop buying them when the nicotine crave vanished. They do not want to lose customers any more than the pricks who make cigarettes want to lose customers.

We all quit and we are not special snowflakes, just nicotine addicts like you.  Looking forward to your quit, the self confidence and self respect that we acquire  when we quit the addiction is a beautiful sight to behold.  You are going to really love your life free of nicotine !
    Your step toward freedom from being a slave to nicotine is getting close now Lia. This should make you very happy, although most of us approach this time with unwarranted fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of failing. All this is unwarranted because once you make the leap, you will do the best you can and you will gather all the quit tools you need as you make the journey. There's a ton of information here on the site to help you with that. The other great news is you will have a ton of people all around you here on the Quit Train to lend what every support you want or need. You will never walk this path alone as long as you're logged on here  So I guess my message is, don't fear what's in front of you, look forward to starting on the most beneficial journey of your life  See you in a couple of days!
    You can do it Lia ...   Looking forward to travelling along with you ....
Thank you all for the support!! DAY 1 without a cigarette!!!
    Glad to hear Lia .... Keep going, one day at a time   That;s how we all become smoke free for life!
Good to see you Lia, congratulations on starting 2019 smoke free
    Happy New Year Lia.  Perfect day to start your smoke free journey!  First week will be tough but you are tougher.  Read everything you can on the forum and stay close.  We are here for you!
Stay strong Lia...it won 't be long until you love the smell of NO SMOKE on anything you wear! And not being looked at like a piece of poo when you are out smoking in the corner of where ever you are. Tomorrow will be 60 days for me and I have to say, it hasn't been quite as hard as what I was afraid it would be, but I have certainly had my moments and still do. Just remember the first week and how you felt and hopefully that will keep you from going back to that point. It has worked for me so far, as I never want that feeling again! Good luck...you can do this!
That's awesome, Lia!  Congrats on Day 1 and Happy New Year!
    Awesome job on the first day Lia -- you can do this.  Tough at first but the rewards are so worth it and you will begin seeing them soon!!!!
    Yay.  Stay focused you will succeed.
    Yeah for you!!!! Best thing ever! Rewards....however small helped me so much!

    Apparently, mirror neurons are a tool in our mental survival kit. We watch other people, and if they live, we do what they did.     I know, that's way simplistic.      I've been feeling very low about having to travel. I don't like to fly anymore. I was a flight attendant for seven years and loved it. Don't know why I don't want to fly again.    So, feeling low, and wanting to smoke.      Yesterday, a shopper came unhinged and loudly and harshly berated me for the way I was ringing up her purchases. She immediately demanded a manager. I called for a manager, then remained  quiet, respectful and apologized, and offered to allow another cashier to help her.  The manager arrived, I finished the transaction, and continued on until the next break.  I was seething with suppressed anger. (Before I went home, the manager called me aside and said that this is typical behavior for that customer; I did nothing wrong.)        At my break, I recounted to another cashier what happened and told her I really wanted a cigarette. I explained that I had quit, but right now was wishing I hadn't. I wanted to smoke. Turns out she smokes; "I keep it to four or six a day."  I had a brief memory of having told myself I'd just have four or six a day. Ha!  I kept myself from asking her for a cigarette.        I strongly craved a cigarette for the rest of the day and during my commute home. I was sorely tempted to ditch my quit.    As I drove, I don't know why, but I thought about mirror neurons and how they are related to learning, peer pressure,  and crowd behavior--the copy-cat effect. I rambled from thought to thought about it and then said to myself, "I can use this to counter the desire to smoke right now."      I imagined two groups of people. I saw one group avidly sucking on cigarettes on a sunless day, with smoke billowing around and smelling up their clothes, hair, and breath. With x-ray eyes, I saw the smoke curling inside their lungs and saw damage being done to their bodies.         The other group I imagined were jogging or swimming, biking, gardening, everyone in the sunshine and breathing the fresh air easily.    I imagined myself walking on by the haggard looking, diseased smoking group and taking a walk in the park in the sunshine with my small dog, breathing fresh air and feeling great.     I began to relax. I mindfully kept my attention on the sunny people, focusing on how these were the survival behaviors, and saw myself copying what they were doing.        I thought about these mirror neurons and the impact my return to smoking could have on another new quitter on the QT forum.  And what would I say in a post? Lame excuses, that's what. What if my returning to QT as a relapsed smoker, having to start over, triggered a copycat effect in one or more other QTers. I'd feel terrible.            Mirror neurons and the copycat effect. We have to be careful about where we turn our attention, be mindful about whom we emulate, and remember that other people may be copying our behavior.       I still feel low about having to fly, but I didn't smoke.       Another day of appreciating QT and saying "no" to cigarettes.        
    Great post Kate and so helpful to so many. You are doing great with your quit and already paying it forward which we all really appreciate  I hope you find flying a little easier now that you won't have to be worried about finding the nearest smoking area  
    Wow !! Kate ...some people are rude for sure ....   Well done ...you stayed strong ....you didn't let the sad folks spoil your quit ...you should feel so proud ....    Hoping further into your quit ...you will be able to fly again and not worry.....   You chose Freedom...great job !!!!
    G’day   Those people are put in this world.... to make the rest of us look good!    Your right Kate it’s all about, how you think about things. C
Today was easier keeping the quit and minimizing the power of craving, in part because I held to visual images of diseased, hunched over smokers, and walking on into the sunshine to be in fresh air on a walk with my dog.    A surprise visit at my store where I cashier from my former supervisor at the store I worked at previously. I asked her to pass on to a co-worker that I had quit, finally. He had been very supportive and recommended a 12-step approach to quitting. I am feeling more confident.
    Way to go Kate, it's the new year, and time for new awareness maybe in the way we approach our craves and fight this addiction.     I think it also links back to the mindful meditation bit somewhere, you gotta focus on the present, and see it for what it is. The "ugly" picture of the smokers life is fact, hence as easy to picture, and focusing on not wanting to end up like that is great motivation.   Great post, good thoughts.      Keep it up.
    Kate ...Your doing great ....   Just visualise... Your nice healthy pink lungs ...to those dirty black ones of a smoker ...take in those great deep breaths of fresh air ...    I got a buzz early on I'm quit ..standing at the back door ,and breathing in and out for a few good deep breaths ...a feel good factor !!!!.....
    Great post, Kate, and you're doing awesome with your quit.  These incidents make you stronger and now you have a tool you can use next time.
    Your visualizations of smokers and non smokers and wanting to be with the non smokers shows good progress. Keep it up. Visualizing smoking as a good or desirable thing is just perpetuating the lies you addiction has told you all these years. You're a non smoker now and starting to see the many benefits of that lifestyle. It will get even better. Keep fighting   
    Might be TLTR for some:         Big Quit Day for so many.  Congratulations for resolving to quit this nasty addiction!  The first few days & weeks might be easy or horrific.  If your chosen Quit method looks like it might fail- choose another. That is, if cold turkey ain’t cuttin’ it- chew some nico - gum or suck on a lozenge. Slap a patch on if needed. Talk to your doc & get some meds.       Your Quit is your quit. Own it. Protect it. Do it & be done with it.        You will find support here.         Do not smoke today. Wake up tomorrow and do the same.  Wake up the next day and do the same.        One minute at a time will become one hour that will become one day that will become one week that will become one month...      Take it one day at a time.  Wake up declaring you won’t smoke this day.  Go to bed screaming “ heck yeah, I didn’t smoke today!”        Wake up. Repeat.        You can do this.  It SUCKS and that’s OK.       Your will to be healthier for yourself, your spouse, your child(ren), your wallet...        IS stronger than your addiction!        Let those reasons fuel the fight.       Happy New Year! 
    "Happy New You Year"    LOVE this, great post lust      So many great points above, I was glued to the board everyday all day my first year. Reading, supporting, celebrating or just playing games really helped keep my mind off my misery. Use the boards and us as needed. Post an SOS if you feel yourself in danger of caving to a crave. Remind yourself everyday how glad you are to be past it and that you never want to have to repeat it. Also consider getting yourself a ticker for your signature. It's a great way to watch the money, time and cigarettes not smoked add up. Super inspiring   Remember you have years of successful quitters on your side and here for you as needed or wanted. We know what you're going through because we've been through it too
Overall I feel 100% better than I did 60 days ago. But I have noticed that my breathing seems more labored...maybe shorter than it did before i quit. I feel it working out , in bed or just setting . I do have an inhaler I use when necessary but it seems worse than before. I know what this is from , just wondering if any of you noticed this when you quit.
That happened to me too wantsit. My breathing got worse for two or three weeks and I was using my inhaler way more than normal. My pulmonologist said it was my lungs working at clearing out the gunk.     It seems to be a pretty normal recovery symptomEdited January 2 by jillar
Thank you! I've noticed it for about the last 2 weeks and it just had me a bit concerned. I really haven't noticed any  junk since I've quit and I figured after all those years I would have. Just more coughing than usual and the above mentioned.
I was about a month in to my quit when my breathing got worse and like I said it did take a good  three weeks or so for it to start getting better. I didn't really cough anything up either but I did notice I cleared my throat more. My phlegmy cough stopped right after I quit though. Luckily coughing isn't the only way of clearing the lungs Its also never a bad idea to get a checkup after quitting. If for nothing else but the self assurance that everything sounds good and the pats on the back for quitting Edited January 2 by jillar
Thank you Jillar. I've felt all the above. I did go to the Dr. about 4-5 months ago and at that time everything looked good. Thank you for your response...it's made me feel better for the time being.
    Hi wantsit, thats the healing process. Some have it worse/ longer. The cilia start to work again ..."As the cilia recover and the mucus is cleared from your lungs, you might cough more than usual — perhaps for several weeks. In addition to reduced cough, most other respiratory symptoms, such as phlegm (mucus) production and shortness of breath, continue to improve for up to a year after stopping cigarette smoking."

    Thank you all! Was thinking to myself the other day  just my luck...I quit to late.
Yea, I did too wantsit AND I almost talked myself into going back to smoking because my breathing was better before I quit. Which wasn't saying much since that was why I quit to begin withEdited January 2 by jillar
Never too late, takes time to heal but heal it does... After i first quit i would walk a couple of blocks and breathe like a bulldog, my breathing kept improving. I can walk miles now and breathe fine. Later in your quit when its cold out or windy you can see how your breathing/lungs are. 9 months - 1 year, let the lungs heal.

wow,,, thats awfull,I should be dead,,I smoked for 30 years,,,,,,   good post,,,,,      RC
Yeah I smoked for over 35 years and it is really sickening to think of all those years of inhaling toxic pollution.  It's a reality test for anyone struggling with their quit.

Who would want to continue after seeing what they are inhaling into their bodies on a daily basis
I remember junior high they showed us movies with anti-smoking messages where the main graphic was comparing smoker's lungs to non-smokers, which was gross, but what happens decades down the line doesn't matter to a teenager. I am in my 50s so these educational videos were a long time ago.      This is immediate and you see the effects cigarette by cig, day by day.Edited January 1 by onthemark
I dread to think of my poor lungs ...but !!!!   A Proud Quitter after 52 years.... It's never too late....
    What amazed me was how scary real the commercials against smoking became but how I would still ignore their message.  I would sit there trying to ignore them, hoping my husband wasn't paying attention.  Sometimes I would try to distract my husband's attention away from them.  I was ashamed inside and scared that most likely that was going to be my reality but not strong enough to change things.  I was addicted and had no idea how to change.  I had tried so many different ways to quit and was unsuccessful.      Somehow, I ended up finding this forum.  What is it that is so different about this place?  It is a place where no one looks down at you - they have all been there.  You were not there physically but it felt as if you took my hands and guided me through.  Smoking took my self esteem and power.  You showed me it was still there and that I could get it back.   
Gross.. when you see it like that.....
    It's crazy because there is a way back. The lungs will repair themselves to a very good degree. They may never be as good as new. You will have caused some irreparable damage but they will be in a lot better condition if you pack in because as I say some self repairing does take place.      First time I've seen a video like that and being so early into my new quit it has shocked me a lot.
I hope it shocked you in a good way. It is sort of funny in a way until you get to the end and see how bad that poisonous gunk is.      Yes, you are right that the body can repair but not all of it unfortunately. The sooner you quit the better. I quit when I was 52 and it was too late to avoid lung cancer, but, hey, here I am three years later and still doing ok, maybe done with that monster. At least I can hope so. Other people get copd, cvd and other cancers. It's never too late to quit but quitting when you are young is the best because the damage just accumulates.
    Was at a family get together. Went digging through my purse for something, then stopped with a second of fear, worrying whether my cigarettes would fall out of my purse. (I was a closet smoker.)  Then I remembered that I don't smoke.   Sigh of relief and bit of a chuckle.
There are a lot of positive OMG moments that take us by surprise once we quit. It really is amazing just how many moments of our daily lives were focused on some aspect of our nicotine addiction. So glad I don't have to worry about any of that stuff anymore  I never even give it a thought these days.Edited December 31, 2018 by reciprocity
    The benefits just keep adding up :)
    I reached into my golf bag after about one month and found an empty pack, oh yeah, I don't smoke.        
    I had a moment like that recently, had to laugh...non smoking life is so good!
...but thought I would take a chance.       I tried to bump one of his threads that was brought from QSMB and posted here, but was unable to locate them.       I was reminded on Facebook today by a close friend of it being 5 years December 28 since the passing of jwg. I don't know how many remember his inspiring and funny well written posts. If you do, you would know what a special person he was. He was not only special to the members that read them, but even more special as a personal friend to some of us that kept in closer contact with him up until the very end.     I just thought I would bring this up in case anyone that was touched by his writings would like to remember him once again. For me, it seems like only yesterday he was diagnosed with cancer at such a young age and the day he passed is still fresh in my mind. I will always miss him.
    I'll bump them Jan, looks like a few already have been bumped.
    I remember him so well....I was only months into my quit ...his post were magical....his untimely death hit me hard ...R.I.P......
    He was a star its a great pity he didn't make it.
    I read some of them on the QSMB and would love to have them here to read.
    I came to know of jwg through his posts on QSMB...after he was gone! His writing made an impact on so many...including me! RIP, sir!
    When QSMB went down, I lost a treasured message from him.  Rest in Peace, Invisible Man,
    He was great man, great friend to so many.   I no longer have my messages from him but I treasure the memories of our conversations.  He helped me so much when I first quit smoking.  Was one of the first to reach out to me privately to cheer me on.  RIP my friend.  
    I gained so much from his writings.... long after he was gone... I'm glad not all of his legacy was lost and that so many were supported by him.
Just out of curiosity...do any of you have spouses that continue to smoke? I'm finding it hard to deal with the smells at times. She doesn't smoke while in our truck and we never smoked in our homes, but when she comes in from having one I can hardly stand it. I try and remember it's only been a month and 8 days or whatever, and I don't want to be one of those people that start bitching now that I'm not smoking , but how do you deal with it ?  Finding it tough right now.
    I smoked for several years after my wife quit. She would comment once in awhile that she knew I just had a cig when I could not smell anything at all. She was really good about it though as she never did this in a way that made me feel bad or guilty. I always tried to be careful about smoking around her though because I respected the fact she was now a non-smoker and likely more sensitive to the smell of smoking.        I'm not sure there's any way to approach this with your wife in a manner that won't have her all up in arms about it. Smokers get pretty defensive about stuff like that - I know I did and I suspect you probably did too. More and more smokers are the outcasts of society these days so when your significant other starts in on you ..... look out.        If she is respecting your situation, in terms of not smoking openly around you and subjecting you to her second hand smoke on a regular basis, I would say that's probably the best you can hope for until she too is ready to quit. That may just happen too as you are setting a great example for her  
    We've had a lot of successful members who had a smoking spouse wantsit. Mine has always been a nonsmoker so I can't comment on that part BUT I can tell you that you're setting a great example for her to quit also  
    It's only when you quit ..you get to know how horrible that smell is ...as a smoker you carnt smell it ...  I agree ...hopefully your wife will see how brilliant you are doing ...and want to join you.... Deep down every smoker would love to quit ....
    My husband is a social smoker, he basically smokes on a Friday night. My father in law also stays with us on a Thursday and he smokes. It's pure rank. And omg kissing a smoker is so gross. Hands up I do say you stink, get away from me, omg you are stinking, aw man that smoke is awful etc. For me, saying nothing is not an option. To say nothing makes is seem like it's ok and clearly it's not. But each to their own. I don't give a shit if it pisses off my husband either. Suck it up or quit.       I did struggle a wee bit one night as I love my husband with all my heart and I was thinking what's the point in me quitting and him not. I really strongly felt that. No point me saving my health if he's just throwing his away. But my pals talked me round. Do not let your partners smoking jeopardise your own quit!!! Really cherish your quit and hold onto it dearly.         You asked how we deal with the smells? I just think ewww I'm sooo glad I don't smell like that anymore! It's so disgusting! And move on....      
My situation is similar to yours Weegie. My husband smokes at work, but never when he comes home for the evening or at weekends when he is with me. I can tell he has been smoking even when he tries to cover it up with body spray. It is a horrible smell, and I also thought why should I bother quitting if he is'nt!!!! At first it made me really mad as he initially quit about the same time as me, but then started the few at work. I have no idea how he refrains from smoking evenings and weekends, if it was me I would be back to 20 a day by now.  I am glad he is respectful of me and I never see him smoke, but I do resent him a bit and wish he would stop. However I have told myself he is responsible for what he does, and I want to hang on to my quit and I am so proud of it. Hopefully he will stop soon. I know he worries about his Mom who is in a nursing home with Dementia and going downhill fast, so maybe that is his way of coping. Look after you and your quit
I quit smoking 2 months ago and my husband still smokes. At times it can be pretty hard, but it does get easier. I defintely don't miss standing out in the freezing cold shivering and smoking... which I am reminded of every time he goes out for a smoke.
Mrs. Sarge smoked for close to 3 years after The Sarge quit. (She's been quit 4 years now)  At all times there were packs of smokes laying around, ashtrays all over the house, cartons in the cabinet/pantry ...   How do you deal with it?    You don't.  There is nothing to "deal with".    You are quit and your spouse is not.    No. Big. Deal.  You just carry on with your plan.   It was never a problem for The Sarges.  It won't be a problem for you if you don't want it to be.   If you are hedging for excuses, this it the perfect excuse.     Don't. Do. That.    It's not at all a problem if you don't want it to be.   EZPZ
I've never had a spouse so maybe not as qualified to comment, but I will anyway.   I watched this scenario play out prior to when I started smoking.   My Dad tried to quit way back in the mid 70's but my Mom didn't,  he made it almost a week with my Mom still smoking all over the house.  I think Dad would have been successful it it wasn't literally in his face the entire time.  He even said that to her face when she made a comment about willpower after he caved.  This was the 70's though, so of course smokers could smoke anywhere, anytime,  it didn't even occur to Mom to maybe go to the garage or outside to smoke.       My parents continued smoking up until their deaths, both had COPD/emphysema and both were very sedentary in their retirements.   My dad went into the hospital for the first (and last) time when he developed pneumonia.  He was forced to quit in the hospital, they gave him nicotine patches, but I'm sure he died wanting a cigarette.     My Mom was also forced to quit when her breathing got so bad she had to have oxygen 24/7.   It was a forced quit.   Also a cold-turkey quit as she refused any NRT.

There are never any packs laying around or ashtrays full, as I stated we do not smoke in our home and haven't for 20 years. I do hate the smell now point blank. She knows it, but cannot stop. I do not want want it to be a problem but will say when in a truck that smells of smoke...that is a problem , and made it hard for me to deal with , you are no undeniably a stronger person than I am as that made me want to smoke worse than I have in my quit.  I do have to deal with it...and will. Just looking to see how others did.
    Hey @Sslip you have any words of wisdom for Wantsit??        
A little different here. For the most part my wife vapes, so the smell isn't quite the same.            On 12/11/2018 at 6:11 PM, Wantsit said:             when she comes in from having on﻿e I can hardly stand it.               I'm not sure whether you mean you find it disgusting or appealing.      I think the key is to recognize the smell for what it is. If you find it objectionable then that should re-emphasize the benefits of the smart choice you have made. If you find the smell appealing and it causes you to question what you are missing out on then the key to that is to make sure you have that recall of why you have quit. For me, it was a struggle, but I recognized what damage I was doing to myself in so many ways. I didn't want to go back to that.     Whatever you do, you make your choice, but it is impossible for you to make it for others. That is all down to them and you can only set a good example. Maybe make sure you have a money jar for you to put the savings in to and treat yourself to something really quite special when you have the cash to do so.

Sslip,      The problem is I now find the smell disgusting. It  just stinks...period. I won't tell her she has to quit because I never know what will happen with me, I'm not even 2 months in yet. But some times it does make it hard for me and at the same time pisses me off. It's her call..I hope I make so she will see the difference it makes with me and decides do it as well. We all make our own choices and mine is to not smoke .  I'm thinking a new driver or putter this spring for my little reward.
    People have to want to quit ...you carnt force them...or degrade them ...it doesn't work... It just makes them more determined to smoke.... I know this by experience....   All you can do is let her see how wonderful it is to be free....and yes Rewards....just concentrate on your Quit....    I hope she joins you too....
    Sslip's idea of the money jar is a good one. Setting up and actual "quit, - money jar" and putting real money in it every day or at least every week might actually be a good subtle way of illustrating just one quit benefit to your wife. You can talk about saving until you're blue in the face but seeing IS believing! I expect it would give her pause for thought anyway.

    I live with two smokers and I notice the smell but only if I make a conscious effort to.        I was married to a non smoker and he never once mentioned the smell. I think ex smokers make a bigger deal out of it (or anything else to do with smoking) than non smokers do.         You smelt like that for years and probably blew that smell in everyone's face every time you spoke lol 
    i feel very fortunate that my wife and i are quitting together....i can only imagine how hard that would be. even if sarge says it doesn't matter.....hahaha     
    Lilly, I'm somewhat a freak when it comes to smoke. I hate the way it smells, that's one of the reasons I quit, after all those years. I was tired of always having to try to hide it. Gum always, cologne on almost all the time. Most people never new I smoked , this coming from them. I am not going to be one of those ex smokers that bag people that do smoke . My point was it is hard for me to to be in a vehicle that smells of stale smoke, smelling smoke on my wife is hard no matter how hard I try. I noticed it when we both smoked. I just hate it more now than ever. I will get over it or used to it, but do not have to like it.  would rather be like this than smoking again. That I never want.

        Daddy, did you love your cigarettes More then you loved me or did I do something wrong? I wish you could have seen my dress Mommy said I looked so pretty.  You could have pined my flowers on  The night I went to prom    Daddy, did you love your cigarettes More then you loved me? Mommys got a new boy friend She says its to hard to be alone.   Are you lonely daddy or dose Jesus  Keep you company ?  Daddy did you love your cigarettes  More then you loved me and mom ?    I wish you would have walked me down the isle   And brushed away my fears, told me no matter what   I would always be your little girl. Daddy did you love your cigarettes  More then you loved me? His name is Jacob ,just like you    His eyes sparkle blue in wonder Why dosent he have a grandpa    To take him fishing or to the zoo   Like all the other boys do  Did you love your cigarettes daddy  Were they really worth it - all that you’ve been missing?

    Bump in honor of jwg, RIP
A lazy Texas river spanning form Kerr county Texas to the San Antonio bay on the Gulf of Mexico.  If you ever need to find a place to relax enjoy the sunshine while refreshing from the hot Texas sun, nothing beats a lazy day tubing down the slow winding of deep greens and blue. Some place your arm able to reach down and feel the stones polished by the millenniums. Hiding secrets of the Alamo and days gone by. A sacred place, where no worries in the world can follow, No troubles from work are allowed to enter, only you and your desire to be at peace can break the waters edge.       In my resent ventures over this past summer I had the opportunity to experience the river , its majesty and glory , Not only was I with the river I was with the finest people in the world to share the experience. By day floating lazily carefree and by night telling stories lounging about the cabin or sitting under the stars on the porch, cooking out burgers some night or fajita’s..            I often think of that trip and the fun we all had, to go back in time , even in memory can be so nice . Some days we would float solo or holding hands keeping close together. other days we banded are pack together by twine and traveled the river as one , like a Robin Hood and his merry men , or maybe Tom Sawyer and some of his boy hood chums.        One particular day we were going solo , but I lashed the tube with the cooler to my rig 6 hours or so , surly you need some sort of refreshment and maybe even pull up on to  a clear shore line for  a bite to eat.. And so we did. After lunch two of are young explores  Decided to forgo the tubes, swim a bit and comb the bottom of the river for secret hidden treasures,, Lost sunglass or the mother load a Iphone or other such valuable loot.        Now with no use for there tubes , the young explores piled them on top of the cooler . So there I was, in my tube tied to a stack of three tubes and a cooler. To which the wind had greater strength to control then the  slow easiness of the river current.  Some times I would find the wind speeding me along , while others the wind dragging me back and my group of merry band of men flowing down the river far in front of me.        While still enjoying the river the ride and the scenery I really had no control of the speed of my travel , to which side of the river I would coast. Sometimes the wind would bring me in to the tree line . Catching me on limbs and others casting me out into the deeper waters. Basicly I was at the mercy of powers much greater then myself..            As history repeats itself ,, this is where I find myself once more, only today laying in my hospital bed.   With each  day that passes more tubes are added to my burden, and now with each tube the wind carries me faster down the river then we could have ever imagined.        Just a few hundred yards back the option of chemo loomed in the air to slow the winds and the current giving me more time to enjoy the river, but now once  more due to powers beyond my control I find myself helpless. My illness grows faster then can be controlled.        I am at peace, I am comfortable. I am in my tube enjoying every last minute of my ride  Down the Guadalupe      I can not see the end to the river nor do I look forward to its end..       I have my friends , I have my family , I have you all , and I have the love of a beautiful women , my angel, my everything to comfort and care for me       I love you all          And will to my best keep you posted         In the mean time        Don’t put things in your mouth and light them on fire !!
    This was one of my favorites of his.
    Mine too @despair not
    It is soooo beautiful and I love reading it. But it does make me cry  
    So nice to read this again, thanks Jillar.  I see some other treasures have been resurrected - thanks!! 
    I read this with tears...   He was special.....

    I am so pleased..jwg...posts can be brought here...x
    thanks for sharing!  I really miss his creative posts and our chats....he was a very unique man
    Sadly a bunch of his posts weren't archived by the way back machine and are lost for now. Hopefully his daughter saved them all before qsmb went down....
    Jill! Lol what happened to qsmb?

By the color of his salt and pepper hair I would have guessed him to be in his mid 50’s I would not say he was overweight , but a few walks in the park would not be the worst way he could spend a little bit more of his time. The biggest impression he really made on me was how , unimpressionable he was . If ever there was a John Q. Citizen this would be him. Everything about this man was average, from his shoes on his feet to that look of bewilderment on his face. Normally I keep to myself, Im not one to go around offering free advice. But I must say, he looked so lost- not that I had any answers. But perhaps I had the right questions or at the very least I had time to listen.    I placed the butt of my fishing pole on the walk and set the drag to loose. Then testing it with a tug , to make sure I would not loose my rig , if I were to get a bite. I walked down the bridge a few paces to where “john” sat on the rail. I was not even yet close enough to offer my hand and introduce my self , when that old familiar smell of stale smoke and tobacco hit me in the face like a brick.. “wow - this one is ripe” I thought to myself.    “ hows it going” I asked as I stepped in closer. “fine” he answered in a nonchalant way That’s , good I said nodding my head in affirmation.. “ you ?” he asked. “I’d be better if they were biting”. “ I imagine so” he said as he jumped down from his perch  “ you from the other side ? “ he asked. “sure am” I boasted with some pride “been over here for past two years now” I love it I added , I could never imagine it being any different. “ yeah” he said in a smug tone “ I hear life is perfect over there , it never rains   And life is roses all the time” Hog wash on that I said. “ we all got ass crap days” no matter what side of the river you live on   Really ? he questioned ,, “sure” I said.    What about money he asked “ I hear tell everyone over there makes more money”   “ Oh my goodness , who have you been talking too ?” “ no one in particular , A guy just hears things you-know”  “ Well I can assure you non of us make more money then we did before crossing over. Now we just have better opportunity’s to save some of it, or spend it on things we once wernt able to, things that make us truly happy” “huh” he said looking over my shoulder off onto the other side; trying to get a peek as to what life might like be living on the other side “your scared of crossing?” I asked. He then turned his head back and looked down the river, then he looked left; back in the direction he came from, then he looked down to his feet and in a small voice “ yes” he sighed  Slowly he lifted his head and said “ Im scared if I cross and don’t make I will have to go back home a failure” “ Im scared if I make it I could loose some of my friends, or even loose myself, and who I am”  “Hmm , I see , these are great concerns” I said I understand your dilemma. For a few miniutes we both stood there in silence looking down the river. He nervously kept his hands in motion as if he washing them in some imaginary sink.    After thinking a min or two I said to him   “ you know, if you don’t cross over to the other side your guaranteed to fail yourself “ but more importantly. I added “there is a secret to making it on the other side that the ones who never cross over can ever learn” “really ?” he asked “what is the secret can you tell me?”   I smiled and put my hand onto his shoulder , looking him in the eye and said    “ No one that has ever truly wanted to make it on the other side has failed. Its only the ones who question there decision and wrestle with the though of going back “ that ever fail . You see I explained , “when you cross over you can not live on both sides of the river” Then off in the distant we both heard a great noise, the sound of fireworks and celebration,    “whats that” he asked”  “oh that.” I said is Just some one that crossed over some time ago , having an anniversary party.   “wow” he said , “ that sounds nice, I think I would like that”  “yes… yes, you would” I assured him.    “ there is so much in this world , you have been deprived living back there in the darkness”    He smiled and said to me “ I think I’ll try”    I smiled back to him and said “ leave “try” here on the bridge , or throw it in the river.  The the path to freedom can not be walked with hope , each step has to be planted with confidence , leaving no room for doubt”
    WOW! 
    I will try to get more over here from jwg. He touched so many of us with his writings.....

    Jillar      Well done for recovering this. Thanks
    That’s a beautiful story and one that portrays a quality of both Quittrain and late QSMB: support. Support, help, understanding, no preaching and judging. 
    Bump 
Taking a couple of cigarettes to the patio with me was the way I could get through making an unpleasant, yet obligatory, phone call to a person who is toxic for me.    I'm about to make that phone call again -- to wish her Merry Christmas -- and the minute I picked up the phone to call, I started a deep craving for a smoke. Or six.       In the back of my mind is the memory of a few posts by various successful quitters that there will be situations that you come up with for the first time since quitting, and you (I, we) have to learn to cope with those situations without a cigarette. And here goes.... dialing...     I'm on that call now and  I'm sitting here typing a boring post instead of smoking.     This person is confusion on steroids.  It's catchy. Takes me a week to regain my own emotional equanimity.      OK, whew. Over. I was a bit impatient. Thoughts kept returning to having a cigarette. Hopefully I was kind. I think I was. Only 12 minutes. A record short call. Usually 20-45 minutes.     And I made it without a cigarette.  Sigh of relief.     On to the ice cream. I'm in need of a dopamine hit.
    Well done Kate 
    Well Done, went in with a plan and it seems to have worked, good for you!!!!
    Another major trigger anticipated, battle waged and won! That's one you'll never have to fear again because you know how to handle it without smoking.  That's how our permanent quits are built - one battle at a time; fought & won  
Might I ask -   If this person is toxic, why not cut ties? I mean dealing with her is no better for your mental health than smoking is for one's physical health.    Edited December 26, 2018 by Jet Black
    I had a similar issue for years and the toxic person was a sister who wanted nothing more than to drag everyone down to her level of misery in life. It was almost impossible to get off the phone with her without being simply rude and hanging up. When it comes to family dynamics, it's not always so black and white as just cutting someone out of your life. In my case the issue resolved itself when she died.
I get the obligation and not being able to just cut this person from your life.. you should be so proud of yourself... you spottedd a potential issue, you went in with a plan... you did what had to be done and you did not have a smoke. What a great feather to add to your quit cap... super effort and your only in week 2... good signs young lady.

It would be too unkind to sever all contact. She intends well, she's tried for years to change her behavior with professional help. She has had clinical depression for decades--well before there was competent therapy or drugs for it. She is nearly 90 now, so she won't be around for many more years. I would regret it for the rest of my life if I did not show her kindness.  I've declined to talk about some things, telling her that these are personal and I don't want to share. She's slipped a couple of times, but she tries.

    quitting smoking is a Journey           and another short about addiction   Here called, Nuggets.    
    Cool.   One is too many and a thousand is not enough.
    These little vids helped me.        When I first quit, I really wanted to know how long this was going to take. I didn't understand about addiction but,    as time went on....as time goes on  I understand more about the journey and as long as I stand strong with NOPE,    I need never be a junkie again.     So, please.  you beautiful smoke free creatures, have patience and determination.   You will be rewarded with a myriad of delights.

    EVERY time I see the nuggets one... it reminds me never to go to that place again.

As silly as this may sound... I just found out that there is (enjoyable!) life after quitting. For the first time in well over 4 months Ive had a quiet, all-by-myself evening with wine and a movie and knitting and a cat. Not one second did I feel a void or the need to fix something. Everything was ok, just the way it was. Including me.   Awesome.    Ticker says Im nearing 70% of half-a-lido-deck. Bank account states I saved over 800 euro's. Calender tells me it's only four days to 2019. After what I would like to call Uhm (Unexpected Hell Month) I'm even steadier in my quit. My non smoking didn't cause any of the events, so it would have been silly to light up. No causal link there.. just associations I continued to break.    Concidering a forever quit ...? Take the leap.  Like many people here I dare say.. if I can quit, you can too.
^^^ I love it when I read something like this that tells me ..... Someone has made it! They have finally realized that all the struggle has been worth it because they have found a life-long quit!      Congarts MLMR!!
    Huge step! Congrats MLMR!
    Super happy for you MLMR 
    I think this might just be my favourite post from you ever and you have had some ripper posts. So happy for you...and so proud of all you have achieved.

My first full year of quit was Oct 6th but my first calendar year will be of course Dec 31st.   One thing i have done for years is keep track of my spending. Two categories used to be "cancer" and also "dumb shit" (relatively needless purchases like entertainment stuff)      Of course for 2018 there was no "cancer". I noticed though at the end of this year, my "dumb shit" spending wasn't really much higher on average than previous years if i were to add my "cancer" and "dumb shit" together.     I kind of have a habit of using the excuse "At least it isn't cigarettes" when buying silly little things. I am not like some hoarder but there are a couple things I enjoy. Nothing that will ruin my health at least.     When you quit, how did your spending change? Did quitting end up being an excuse for other frivolous purchases or..?
    My spending changed for sure. More spending on clothes, pamper sessions, better hotels, better restaurants. Also saving more and still more money in the current account as well!!!! It's pretty amazing and a massive bonus to quitting. 
Thousand of dollars a year on smokes ... and yet there is no extra money by quitting.   It's all spent on travel to the world's premier climbing locations ... and climbing gear.   A much healthier hobby.     Suprisingly: considerably safer, too.   EZPZEdited December 20, 2018 by sgt.barney
    Quitting for me was never about the money..... It was about saving my two plates of meat ( London slang for two feet )...   But as time past I began to feel the benieft of health and money....    Going for a Mediterranean cruise in May....could,nt have done that if I still smoked ...your kinda limited when your feet have dissapeared.....
Spending has not really changed other than all the money I have saved since quitting (and as said before I have all that money at this time waiting until the 1 year anniversary to figure out what to splurge on!!!).

I am just wondering, if I haven't asked yet - when your doctor layed that bit of news on you about possible foot amputation if you did not give up the cancer sticks, how did you handle that news?

I am tempted to ask how much but that would be nosy. And holy crap martian, I remember when you sent me a PM about coming up on your three month mark and the battle that may ensue. But NOW you have just two weeks, two weeks til you hit a SOLID YEAR. Congrats, I mean you might as well say it is done.     I never set my savings aside, i kind of dwindled it on other silly things but yeah now i think, "I should have set it aside". Would have only been about $500 (I smoked RYO so they were cheap) but anyways...

    My Heart did hit the floorJB....thats why I quit and stayed quit....no romancing the cig here....!!!!!
But my spending changed, I bought the good cuts of meat..... I bought the fancy ingredients not the home brand.... and when I was unemployed for a few months there I managed to make $5000 support me, a kid, 3 dogs and 2 cats for 4 months and pay bills too.... if I had still been smoking well probably not,
    JB if you look at my ticker it is pretty close to right, a couple of hundred more.  Guess this is a good problem to have trying to figure out what to do.
I know.... you could come to Aus to visit me and CbDave! So lets just say its about $3100 come the Lido Moment... in Aussie money thats $4,403.66 ... allowing for the transfer fees.... or you could have a real Lido Cruise moment.... or you could do some renos to the house and every time you look at them you could get that kick of pride because your tenacity and determination lead to that... well done buddy...

    Oh I know... by yourself a very expensive watch and then every time you check the time you will be reminded just how you earnt the watch and it will be yep.... not smoking is good.
When I quit (and previously as a smoker) I rented my place. The next year I bought my own house, and what I paid for in rent + $ that I spent monthly on cigarettes = a monthly house mortgage (including insurance), with change to spare.     Able to afford being a homeowner. It's one of the top of 5,325,263,902 reasons to quit smoking.
    Let me ask my wife how her spending habits changed once I quit smoking. I'll get back to you on that.

What I've saved for the past two weeks (since Dec 12 quit)  will cover what I will lose in pay next week. I am taking unpaid vacation time to visit my new granddaughter back east (USA).   When I think of smoking in terms of hours & minutes of work per pack of cigarettes....disbelief.    Normally, the money will go to my retirement account.

    ... YOU STICK ! I'm layed I in hospital, have been since Sunday, having tests.  I had a TIA, in short a mini stroke.    Came on fast and left me without any lasting damage ( thank God).   Still have to have the carotid arteries cleared in an OP on Thursday as they are blocked.   And the cause. I miss out on the high blood pressure, bad diet unfit etc, and manage to tick two boxes  Male and    you guessed it .....an ex smoker!   Damn it.... but I'm over it now.... I'm of for the OP on Thursday.  So I might be missing in action for a few days. Chris        
    Im sorry Dave, but its nothing major thats good. Try to get in shape. I tell you walking is addictive as hell and you get toned in no time, plus the health benefits. Eat better too? Good luck. 
    Bloody hell Mr Stoic .... you frickin been in the hossy since Sundee an ya only just tellin us now!!!!!!  Typical Aussie male too... Oh I just had a TIA... only a mini stroke... off to the OR on Thursday, blah de blah de blah blah, get the pipes cleaned.... Frcuk a Duck mate that's some serious shit. So will be keeping you in my thoughts on Thursdee... sendin' healin vibes and all that good stuff.... Shell Chocolates always speed up a recovered  ...... seriously get better soon and get back online because I don't want my days starting without a G'day.    
    Get Well Soon.      It's a stark reminder of why we should never smoke again.       I can't help but wonder whether the outcome would have been quite so promising if you hadn't quit.      Hope you are home and back to full health very soon.
    Sorry to hear you're poorly Dave  Luckily they seem to have a handle on it and it was not as bad as it could have been. Wishing you the very best in your OP and recovery. We will make sure the NOPE thread gets fired up daily until your return  
    Sorry to hear this Dave! Hope they get you back up and running soon!    Also thankful for your solid quit; knowing that being a non-smoker will make recovery easier (and you won't be tempted for relapse) Take it easy 
    Keep well
    Aw, damn, Chris !   This sucks. Wishing you a speedy recovery.  Check in as much as you can,    we do worry, you know.  Love,   S
    I hope you bounce back quickly Chris.
    Sorry about your TIA Chris  I've had a few people who have had one and they feel so much better after getting the carotid artery cleared. Glad there was no permanent damage!        
    Aww buddie...sorry to hear this ....dam cigarettes..... I wish you speedy recovery.... We,ll keep your seat warm ....
    That's really rough, Chris, but I'm so glad you got the warning shot while there is still time to correct the problem.  Nothing fun about surgery, though, so I'll be cheering you on and wishing you a quick and full recovery.  
    I'm sorry to hear this, Chris.  I wish you a speedy recovery.
    Chris thankfully you are doing better now.  Best wishes for the upcoming OP, do well -- you will be in my prayers....
Chris, sorry to hear this....It is good you are an ex-smoker going in for surgery, remember that!       I had several tia's and then a stroke in 2017 that landed me in hospital...where I then started my quit journey. I opted for the stent over the roto-rooter chemical clean out of the artery...and watched the whole op while it was happening! Did feel better afterward!      Stay strong, will be thinking of you!
    Whishing you well and hope to see you back starting the nope-thread soon!        
    Get well soon Chris. (try to milk it for all its worth as well ) 
    Hope you feel better soon, Dave.  Smoking is truly the gift that keeps on giving.  As much as we like to think that our body has recovered, some damage is probably longer lasting than we realize.     I keep wondering if we could successfully quit now then what kept us from quitting earlier.     Hope to see you posting here soon.
It's Thursday in your neck of the woods Chris.  Hope your procedure goes well and you feel back to 100% soon.
    Hope all went well....speedy recovery .....
    Hope everything went well with the op Dave, wishing you a quick recovery.   Take care 
    Good to see you here Chris, hope everything went well and you're feeling better already 
G'day   Got rid of the drips and drains. Drugs out of the system so it's safe to say something now. Got a cracker of a scar running up one side of my neck. Kinda looking foward to getting the matching one on the right.  Gunna tell everyone that I got bit buy a shark. I got away before he could close its mouth......    Can't let truth get in the way of a good story...   CEdited November 23, 2018 by CbdaveSpeeling

    Glad to hear you are recovering, Chris.
Hello,      So sorry to see this has happened, please let us know how you progress with the recovery.       It could have been worse - be glad that you quit 3 years ago, it could have been the difference between death and surviving this.       It is never too late to quit smoking.           Cristóbal
    Rooting for your speedy recovery here Chris. 
    Lol!! Glad everything has gone well!
G’day all   Thanks heaps for all your best wishes... I’m not just saying this it’s really raised my spirits.    Ive got some colour in my cheaks it’s really noticable how good you feel with a head full of oxygenated blood!  Managed to get the yellow iodine out of the beard and its back to a proper silver again. As for the bad trim, it will grow in time. Spiritually, it’s knocked me around a bit more than I care to admit. Over the last 8 years I’ve been operated on for 2 major injuries, I’m a 2 1/2 year cancer surviver but this has been the hardest.  I think it’s coming back from being semi paralysed down one side with a foggy head that scares you. As for not smoking. My doc said great, even a recient non smoker, he could work with that. Being a 3 year non smoking better still once those carotid arteries are clear they’ll stay that way. As for my heart trust me they have had a captive patient and every test shows those arteries are clear. My medication is one low dose aspirin and one statin per day. Don’t know if that will change when the other side is unblocked.      Back to just a couple of days work next week, ill ease back into it.....    Really pray that no one has to go through this. It’s no fun, if never wish it on anyone.... just read about it... trust me  Chris
Glad your recovering physically.... and spiritually.... I had to giggle at the iodine stains on ya santa beard.... and do i get a gold star for not stirring on that fact..So how many Tassie jokes are you copping??? I am sorry its rattled you so much but having paralysis of one side, however short term, would throw anyone for a loop. You, me mate, are a survivor.... you beat cancers arse, you kick the nicobitch to the gutter..... and this too will be chalked up to yet another steller Chris victory.... and how proud and rapped were you to hear the doctor being so happy with your 3 years smoke free status.... one more set of pipes to be cleaned and you will be like a new man.... not that there was anything wrong with the old man, we kinda like him.... but clean pipes have to be good.     Don't rush the back to work... although I get the fact it makes it easier to deal with other stuff when you have something else to occupy yourself.     So spirit lifting... yeah it sucks, yeah its scary, yeah you had already done the right thing and been through a health crisis so its kinda unfair... but your still here, your healing quicker than smokin' Chris would have, and you will heal better than you would have..... and someone lurking is going to read this thread and think shit... imagine if that happened to me, now, as a smoker... and it may just be the final straw that convinces them that now is the time to quit... because everything happens for a reason, even if we ourselves never know what that reason is.        Hope ya back to fighting form soon... just like your fellow Bananabender Horn.... just treat this health concern like an annoying Mundine... Edited November 30, 2018 by notsmokinjo
    Gday Jo Your very right you know. I should really be acknowledging how much giving up smoking has given me. In reality I’ve given myself a pretty special gift in given up smoking. It’s given me so much more than smoking ever did. Truly the gift you can give yourself that does keep on giving...  On the subject of my beard your correct it’s not a Santa beard, it’s actually a Ned Kelly beard just mine comes in white....    C
    I am so relieved and very happy to hear of your recovery.  Thank you for keeping us in the loop.    Saz
    Wow, cbdave, I just checked to see what was up here at quittrain after being off for awhile. Sorry to hear you got hit with this. That must have been really scary to go through the TIA and the treatment.     I have been well since my episode with lung cancer but I do have side effects from the chemo I had after surgery. It's also a 'gift' from smoking all those years. So happy we both quit and became long term survivors and quitters.       I still get the odd twang of missing smoking and that's why I checked in. Thanks for posting your story. It's a great motivation to quit and stay quit.
    Get better soon Dave and go whop that shark on the noggin

    So what does a Chinese general, military strategist, writer and philosopher of old and smoking have in common?      I'm currently reading his book, aptly titled "Art of War" and one of the quotes have struck a chord with me as being quite relevant in the daily battle we have with our quit. The quote goes thus: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.      From the time I joined this forum, everyone who welcomed me gave me the advice, read up, know your addiction, know what nicotine does to your body, know how you react to the initial days of your quit, drink up on the knowledge.     And I did that...not saying it was all smooth sailing, but it sure helped. The thought that I'm actually cleansing my body, and the nicotine is desperately trying to keep it's hold on me helped me grit my teeth and work through the initial days. Even now, whenever I've had those nasty triggers, I've come on here, and been reminded of the fact that it's not something my body needs, but something my mind is tricking me into thinking I need it.       Know yourself, know your addiction and you will not fear the result of a hundred battles.   May you always be victorious in every battle you enter my QT family.        Merry Christmas!!!
    What a great quote Tammy, and so fitting. Thank you and Merry Christmas to you too xoxo

    Great post Tammy    Know yourself ,and know your addiction, and you will not fear  the result  of a hundred battles ....    Love this !!!!  So well said ....knowledge is your weapon ....
    That's right! You get it Tammy  
    Wow Tammy those are very powerful words and another quote to add to my fridge.  Merry Christmas to you also.
    Newbies ...middle newbies ....anyone who needs  support ...before you smoke ....post a SOS....  There is always  someone here ....  Merry Xmas. !!!!
I am 100% sure I will get through these days smoke free. Still, the nico-b*atch is screaming like a madman.         Going to be so so so sooo proud when all this is over (not a huge fan of christmas). Another milestone will be mine to celebrate!
    Good work ....of course you can do it ...after all its just another NOPE Day....and so on .....
    AHHHH....The Holidays.  Hope everyone is OK and NOPE-ing their way into a brand new year.   NOPE-ly yours,  S
    HALT is definitely my first go-to now when I feel the tide coming in with a wave of a crave.    H, not really, but I ate ice cream. That can't continue. "A moment on the lips, forever on the hips."   A, nah  L, my dog is enough company, plus I have a lot of social contact at work. Solitude is a relief....but then I want to smoke. T, not tired, but I'm going to end the night because all I can think of is going to the store for a pack and smoking a few.     What stops me is a chance encounter with a smoker earlier today. The smoke halo around him wasn't totally disgusting, but it was not pleasant, either. It did make me want to smoke. I knew it would taste terrible, but that never stopped me from smoking before.     No, I need a longer list of distractions for when I'm low on energy but it isn't time to sleep for the night. Took the dog for a walk, but it's cold and rainy (Seattle weather), and all she wanted was to get inside where it's warm.     Bored. I'm bored. And lethargic. It's close enough to tired that I'm saying good night. Because I forgot once to pledge in the morning, I'll pledge tonight for tomorrow.   And tomorrow I'll come up with a few things I can do when I'm craving but too low energy to repaint the house or scrub floors.      No doubt there are ideas from you all floating around here in posts. I'll take a look on my next day off.
    I heard Mary Poppins used to smoke. Instead of NOPE or HALT or SNOT or whatever, she used to say - Supercalewhateverthehellitwas.    
    My distractions were staying glued to the boards whether it was reading, posting, replying to posts, celebrating milestones and especially socializing and playing games. It was a great way to keep my mind busy and off the constant craves. 
    As Jillar said, coming here and posting, reading all you can and then some and playing games was a great time waster and .... it educated me about this addiction. Romancing the cigarette is a big no-no because it perpetuates all the lies that our addiction has told us since we started smoking. Thinking you can have just one is another big no-no. That leads only to relapse.     Instead, look at the reasons why you originally quit and all you have invested in your quit to date. It's an incredible effort that has huge value so why would you ever consider throwing that away? Anyone can choose to smoke; that's easy but only people committed to a better lifestyle can quit. It takes commitment, perseverance, and time to get there but it's available to anyone who wants it.
    When I read the words ..Take smoking off the table ...no matter what the hell is going on....my junkie brain clicked ...the only  way to quit successfully...is too never smoke again . No matter what is going on around you ....sometimes it's hard....but always doable ....
    I used to love just sitting for a spell and thinking or reading a serious book (psychology, business management, self-improvement, etc). I've been attempting to do that this morning, and even though I'm wearing a patch during the day, I feel a hunger for a cigarette.  I'm fidgety.   For now and for a while, I can't sit in a comfortable chair and free-think, let my thoughts flow while my mind is in a semi-meditative state. Images and emotions of smoking interfere with thought freedom.    Keeping my mental guard up, pushing away the smoking images and desires takes effort and takes me out of any quiet-mind thinking.   It's a wee bit annoying. Frustrating.  It's tiring.      
    Hang in there Kate, what you are going through is totally normal for where you are in your quit. The first month is by far the hardest and especially those first three weeks. So go easy on yourself and I promise it will get better and you will be back to loving just sitting and thinking again  
    Be patient Kate ....our bodies have a lot of healing .....  Specially when we have smoked for Decades ...it's used to having all those chemicals every so often ,every day....  It has to undo ...what we have done ....    Be kind to yourself ....quitting is a journey...
    Kate,  that is the tussle that goes on in your brain between your addiction and wanting freedom.  You have been through the tough part so keep going forward and don't look back.   Kate, I really love reading your threads.  You have such a propensity for writing.  Did you ever think of writting a book?  I think there might be a best seller in there some where.

You're very kind, Linda. My life is not interesting enough for anything about myself, I am not qualified enough at anything to publish as an expert, and my imagination wouldn't be creative enough for a novel.    If I wrote a book, the only person who would read beyond page one is my mother. And of course, she would be dutifully enraptured with it.
    Well, I have had three days of dumb and dumber installing flooring in my house.  I thought if I went to a reputable dealer, instead of the Home Depot, things would go smoother.  Needless to say, my house has been torn up for too long with Christmas next week.  I put the dogs in day care the first two days but decided to endure the third.  I can tell you that I am definitely on edge.  I have to put the house back together but grocery shopping was on my list for today.     Had made my list but suddenly thought of something.  Finding a pen in my house can be a real challenge.  They must be well hidden or the puppies love to chew them to pieces.   In the process of trying to find a pen, I was scrounging through a drawer and what would appear?  A darn cigarette! I have been feeling solid in my quit for a while now but I was surprised at the thoughts that went through my mind.  I actually thought about smoking it.  Just one.  Once it is gone, that is it.      I actually thought about this for a bit and then I got up and put it down the garbage disposal. I can say though that it was close.  I am a little shocked and disappointed at myself.  I guess it will never really be a thing of the past.  My quit will be something that will challenge me everyday.    For today, I did do the right thing.
Hey, don't be this hard on yourself! You are not even 6 months in yet. Of course something like that is gonna tempt you big time - no surprise there  You did the right thing and likely because you educated yourself here about what happens when someone thinks they can have "just one".     I say Bravo!! You done good     In a year from now, when you find a smoke, you'll just laugh at it. Carry on. You will make it!

    I agree with everyone Linda, don't be so hard on yourself. If anything be proud of yourself for throwing that damn cigarette down the disposal. You're in charge now! And I hope that your floors turn out beautiful even if it is taking longer than expected....
    Don't make me come over there with my frying pan....I have a Turkey to cook......   I'm proud of you my lovely chicklette..... You were tested...and you beat nicotine's backside.....  Give yourself a massive pat on the back.....    Believe me , if you had of smoked it ....you would be devastated .....and we would have all been very sad ....

    So there is a glass it has milk in it half way.... two people look at the glass.... one person says oh no that glass is half empty... the other person says oh look that glass is half full.... so these two people look at your challenge today.... on Ms Negative Nancy of the half empty glass says... I am a bad person I wanted to smoke.... But Ms Possitive Polly.... she looks at the event and says... How frickin awesome am I... I was stress, to the max, I had to be in two places at once, I had dumb and dumber invading my personal space and then I had that nicodemon in my ear telling me to smoke some skanky random leftover.... but I did not smoke, nope, nope, nope, I trashed that smoke... I stood tall.... I am a freaking quitter. Well done me!        Every month it gets better... but be proud of yourself because while this might have been a close call, and I can see it, I have had them... lots because apparently I had secret smokes stashed all over the house.... you answered with the knowledge you have given yourself and you said I don't think so and gave it in.

    Linda,  Be aware that random temptations or wild thoughts or craves     will come up during your first year of Freedom. They seem to come out of the blue and catch you unaware.    Please remember NOPE and hone your vigilance.   These are the last remnants of addiction,   the last neurotransmitters that haven't gotten the memo,    YOU QUIT SMOKING.   Great Work Today, gfriend.  Great work.
    Awesome Linda!! I can feel your your slight frustration lately. But I have to say you're a winner! Great job.
    Great job, Linda.       No reason to be disappointed.  As everyone else said, you're still fairly new in your quit and things will get easier.  The important thing is that you didn't smoke.  That is awesome.
    Looked at my face in the mirror this evening after work, and I had to look more closely....my complexion is a tad lighter or brighter, or something. It used to have a grayish tone that was really unattractive. Cosmetics didn't help much. Guessing that improved circulation is having something to do with better coloration. Is this common?
    Isn't it great Kate? I noticed right away that my hands and feet were so much warmer now 
    Yes! Blood circulation !!!   Congrats!
     Yes, yes, yes!! I have been told by many that I have a glow about me since I quit. I believe it is due to better circulation now. I loved hearing that...and it helped me in the early days of my quit when the craves were coming fast and furious!! I didn't want to lose my glow! 
That was one of the very first (and quite unexpected) consequences of my quit.  I really had no idea about my grey pallor until I began to see something very different emerging after a week or so into my quit.  It was eye-opening!  If you're like me, it'll be the first of many (ultimately endless) benefits you'll enjoy.       Christian99 17 Years Quit
    Yes is very common.  As said above your blood circulation is improving and will continue to do so.  Many more benefits to come!!!!
    My complexion changed too. Not sure it was a result of quitting the ciggies though?
When I first quit..... My number one Mantra...........Smoking is not an option Followed quickly by my 2nd Mantra...............No Matter What Don't get me wrong.....there were times I felt like a trapped animal with nowhere to escape, had the urge to pull my hair out of my head, cut and skin myself like a snake (no, i'm not a cutter), run down the street naked screaming at the top of my lungs...okay..that's a little extreme but I was damn near close.  But still...no matter what...I made the commitment to myself that I was never ever ever going to smoke again.  I couldn't think beyond that day of course...so I had to do this...One Day at a Time. There have been debates about this subject.  The ones who argued against this and said they are adults and don't like to be told what to do so the idea of taking the option away makes them feel trapped and then they want to smoke even more.  I say that's bullshit!  Ironically...the ones who fight against the idea of Smoking is not an option....Well...historically speaking...they are the ones who disappear and come back to say they relapsed.  Again. When you have a baby..the second he or she is born...you take one look at that baby and you COMMIT....for life.  No matter what...you are going to protect this child and nurture it.  Do you turn around 6 months later and decide...I don't like being told what to do...I feel trapped...I don't want to do this anymore...??  Most normal person with values and morals won't....it's not even an option....a thought....it's just Out of the Question.  It's absurd, right??  Well....no different here.   I even imagined the worst thing that can happen in my world....(i'm a mom and grand-mom so you can imagine what that would be)  just the mere thought of that makes me get teary eyed and want to vomit...but still I know...smoking won't change it or make me feel better...No Matter What....smoking is NOT an OPTION.  Whenever I had that crave...I just said..."Girl...do whatever you need to do...but smoking is just not an option so..think of something else sister"  I pictured myself on a desert island with no smokes in sight and I surrender to the fact that ...I just am not going to smoke because that's Not an Option.  Immediately I felt better...I relaxed...I surrendered....and moved on with my life...until the next crave..and I did it again.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Amazingly enough...I didn't die. I think if you allow the idea of smoking as an option to creep into your head even for a second....you are doomed to either struggle harder than you have to....and relapse eventually because it just becomes "too hard"  OR...you do keep your quit...but you took the harder way to get there...and not only that....the urge to smoke get's stronger..not weaker. Don't listen to that bratty voice in your head that says...I don't like being told what to do.  Because YOU are the one who made the decision to quit.  That's why you are here...that's why you keep coming back.  You want to quit.  The question is...how bad do you want it?  What are you willing to do to get it??   SMOKING IS NOT AN OPTION NO....MATTER...WHAT Make that commitment today!!
Second that babs, if you can't commit to NOPE or NTAP I don't think you are 100% committed to quitting, your just going through the motions.......
Brilliant post babs....there is only one way to quit.....NEVER take another puff....no matter what....What got me through the bad times....smoking is not on the table....EVER....x
Brilliant post babs....there is only one way to quit.....NEVER take another puff....no matter what....What got me through the bad times....smoking is not on the table....EVER....xIn turn you telling me that got me through... If smoking is not on the table then what can you do instead...and small battles were won, which turn into big victories!

My imagery has been of the store and a promise of relief of tension, but I didn't consciously recognize the picture in my mind. In fact, I've not really used imagery at all to help me with this quit.       I realize that I've been using phrases to help me with avoidance of smoking and plowing through cravings, but words/audio are not my primary method of learning: imagery/pictures are. I am very visually-oriented and dream in color.      It's powerful to mindfully focus on colorful images where there are no cigarettes around. I can imagine that store in gray tones and as not having cigarettes, or a big Mr Yuck sticker on the doors, or imagine a vacant lot where the store stands.       I really appreciate this post. It reminds me where my power to change comes from--imagining the result I want in mental pictures, not words.    Just creating some imagery to use when cravings hit will occupy my mind when I need distraction.        Thanks to Babs who wrote it and Paul 723 for bumping it.
Many successful quitters here on QTrain have quit on a whim and just like them, I quit on a whim too.This is what led me to making one of the most important decisions in my life on a whim... It was after a trip to California,  where finding a place to smoke was problematicand I was among non smoking friends.  For the first time,I started seeing addiction for the slavery that it is and I acknowledged my bondage.When slipping outside for another smoke, I glibly announced,"I'm going out now, to shoot up." On the aeroplane back home,  a colossal coughing fit overwhelmed me.I had to stand in the back while attendants tapped my back and brought me water.That was weird, I thought.  That was awful.  What was that about ? After landing,  I didn't rush outside for a smoke before climbing into a jitney.Something had changed.Instead, I  thought, why don't you try and quit....you already have 6 or 7 hours clean ?  Why not ? Let's quit smoking for a while and see how that feels.  I spent the next 72 hours sleeping a lot, drinking whisky and reading all about quitting smoking, all about nicotine addiction.After those days, as nicotine left my body, quitting became a wager with myself,  a bargain.  'If you don't feel better in five minutes...maybe you'll feel better tomorrow...if you are not feeling pretty good by next week...or,  in a month...see what happens after a year.'You can always go back to smoking. You know what that feels like. The thing was....I was feeling Free.  While I was beating a trigger or a crave....I was learning how to be Free.It was intoxicating !  It was empowering !That was where the whim became a serious enterprise.I realized, I would conquer any obstacle to my freedom from nicotine, it was just a matter of time and choice. Maybe you will quit on a whim.You don't need much.  Cool clear Water,  the fresh Air you breathe,  some Kindness towards yourself, and a Willingness To Be free.
Why wait...for all the nasty stuff... Or leave it too late...
I quit on a whim too! Even though I had tried so many times and failed. Use this forum, support from these here will make you stronger!!!

    bump for anybody  taking a chance on a whim.  Quitting smoking is a great adventure.
I am a planner extraordinaire.  Spreadsheets, calendars, reminders, graphs.  I planned at least 50 quits over the decades.      That being said, I actually quit on a whim.         I was so tired of going to bed wheezing every night and feeling shortness of breath.  One night, after my final evening cigarette, I said, "That's my last one. I'm done."  In the back of my mind I thought I'd last a maximum of 3 days.  That seemed to be my normal "quit" time limit.  I still, to this day, can't say exactly why this time I didn't start up again after day 3, or 10 or 100.  I just know that the longer I went, the more valuable my quit became to me.  I didn't want to throw it away, even when the cravings seemed unbearable.        Now I feel completely free.         So, I'd encourage anyone who decides to spontaneously quit to go for it.  You never know if some unknown factor will kick in and make it your forever quit.                                               ****** Of course planning, education, and support greatly improves one's chance of success.******
    Same here. Quit on a whim in the middle of a cold, damp winter after a coughing fit while standing in a parking lot on a Saturday. Quit the next morning and have never looked back. Well, I've looked back but I never went back 
I also quit on a whim (see my signature !!!). I woke up one morning, looked at the cigarettes on the table by my bed. I remember thinking I was so tired of smoking, and at that moment I made a decision to not smoke any more.        I smoked for 30 years, about 2 packs a day for most years, and had never quit, or really thought very much about quitting.      My quit was very easy. Too easy I think !!!     I did not tell my wife, who was also a smoker, but she realized very quickly I was not smoking and she quit a week after I did.         Her quit was very difficult, but now we are both quit for almost 6 years and still help others quit. In the internet, she prefers to help in Facebook, and I prefer to help in regular forums. We also both help others personally to quit.     For both of us, it was the best decision we ever made.          If you are still smoking, and think you cannot quit, keep reading in this forum. The real truth is that all smokers can quit, even you. Once you realize that smoking is really about nicotine addiction,  and get further education about it, your fears will disappear and you will successfully find the freedom you are looking for.            Cristóbal    Edited June 14, 2018 by Cristóbal
    Nice post. I used to wish I could quit on a whim. I made quitting out to be a drama. On reflection though I realise it could have been easier.       
    Addiction is a bitch, G,    Although my initial impetus to quit was on a whim, it took more than whimsy to succeed.  It took resolve and focus. In hindsight, most of us will realize we could have made it easier on ourselves but, we must remember this is a pervasive Addiction .   Once our resolved is established, it is just a matter of focus and time but getting there can be grimy. The voice of the addict is a seductive menace.      Congratulations on your quit, G. I look forward to your year celebration in the Fall.  
    I quit on a whim too. Smoked first couple hours of day and just said duck it.  Read a bunch and here we are.

I have quit on a whim many times. It typically lasted four hours.   I had to set up a more structured plan of attack to quit. Went from 30 to 3 cigarettes a day for three days then to NONE.   Not sure how well the step-down method works for most but it is what I had to do.
    I quit on a whim... kinda.... sorta... yep defo a whim... should listen to that little voice more often.... the one that says go on give it go.... I am so proud to say I don't smoke, I quit.
I was planning on quitting for a long time after 3 odd attempts where I failed. One which took me to beyond 3 months.       So one fine day when I reached work, I chucked my usual morning smoke with tea that I used to have everyday, and just had the tea.  And told myself, if you're serious, don't keep saying "One day". Make today "Day One", and that was it.     Well, it's only been 6 months, but I'm sticking to my quit like paper to glue.
I quit on a whim on april 1st because i kinda wanted to make it a joke and see how much i could endure. And hey i did it.       Nah i keed. We have to laugh too or else we go insane Edited December 21, 2018 by StewieTech
    Working my way through a craving.  HALTed, then stumbled on a post Paul bumped yesterday about dopamine-inducing rewards. I'm about to go to the grocery store for just such a reward.  I was debating cleaning the apartment   vs reading a book I just checked out from the library entitled, "Getting Things Done," (David Allen)    vs watching an episode of Criminal Minds on Netflix vs washing the inside of my car windshield  vs cleaning up the garden from dead summer flowers.     A light clicked on as I realized that indecision causes me to want to smoke,. It's a big trigger. BIG trigger. So I guess the take home message from this is that while I am doing one task, always have the next thing I want to do in my mind. Then I will not have so many pauses of indecision where I want to smoke while I am waffling about.     Speaking of which, waffles with butter and maple syrup would  spur the release of dopamine. And then I don't have to go to the store and elbow my way through crowds of Christmas shoppers. Pancakes would also be good.    But I'd really like to see what the pastry selection looks like today. Apple fritters would be good. With coffee. But then I wouldn't sleep well tonight--the caffeine.     Actually, I should really be out walking the dog. This is Seattle and it rains a lot, today is no exception. But there is a break in the rain at the moment.    But the dog is asleep and won't want to go out in the cold.     And there are pastries with my name at the bakery counter.      (You see how easy it is to be indecisive?!)
    I used smoking to avoid doing things I didn't want to do or just to put off those things I had no real interest in doing. Then again, I also used smoking after I did things to reward myself so it was a bit of a puzzle because I was smoking at both ends of tasks. Took a while to sort through all that stuff and become normalized again.
    I love what you are doing -- you are beginning to sense the triggers (big ones at first, then the smaller "uh-oh" ones.  Believe it or not you are moving in the right direction.  Soon those big triggers won't be so harsh and you can breeze thru them.  Good pick-up for you, moving in the right direction now!!!
    You're doing great Kate and any of those treats sound good to me 
I'm not sure the distinction matters that much, but I'd argue that your indecision is as much an effect of recovery as a cause of a craving.  I was extraordinarily indecisive and unfocused for quite some time in the early stages of my quit, and it would be wise to anticipate and plan for such symptoms moving forward.  Don't feel like there's anything wrong with the quit if these experiences persist--they're frustrating for sure, but not at all atypical.  Time is your friend in this process.         Christian99 17 Years Quit

I hadn't thought of that. It's helpful to know that this may be recurring for a while, at least.    When I felt indecisive, I'd go outside on my patio for a smoke and think about my options. I felt better, then I'd come in and act on my decision.  I'll work on a substitution thinking-break without the cigarette.  Goodness knows, eating  the ice cream I eventually settled on didn't help with making any decisions. All of my to-do tasks were still undone and the ice cream lost its appeal.  Thanks again; I'll think about this. And practice patience and mindfulness,
    Kate- you are still not smoking so you are doing FANTASTIC!  It may help you to think about the comfort that routine has given you. Most smokers love routine, that is why it is so difficult to let go of the cigarettes. So, replace your old routines with new, healthier, happier ones. If they are moving you towards your goal, then they are part of the plan. Stay the course. If you find yourself having so much difficulty with decision, you may want to make a calendar or list for yourself. I.E. on Monday, Wed and Friday you do this etc. Use this as a starting point for reorganizing yourself and then be flexible for the new experiences you will be encountering.     
    The addiction causes you to crave. This is the direct link that supersedes other thoughts or desires.   The addict wants their jolt of endorphins every half hour or so.    You succeed when you wrench your choice away from nicotine  and begin to really listen to your body and what your body requires.    (as in HALT)     
Indecision may cause you to crave Kate, but remember this.  You only need to be decisive on one thing.  DO NOT SMOKE.  Bit by bit your brain will become rewired and accept the fact that doing things without a cigarette is natural.  Keep up the good work.  You're doing great. Edited December 21, 2018 by BKPtypo
    Yes! Trust in what others who are quit for years say. It will get easier the longer you just apply NOPE to your daily life. It's not always easy and it doesn't always make sense in terms of how our brains were wired as smokers but the truth is ....... as long as you NOPE each and every day and live by that pledge; you too will be free of this addiction that only takes and gives you nothing good in return.
    Yes, I ask cause I am THAT bored...     Anyways, I am not an easily excitable person but when I do get such or if I am happier than normal, I find myself thinking, "A smoke would be great right about now".   The most common occurrence is when I learn that some sort of "bad news" isn't nearly as bad as I imagined.      It is weird cause i could be almost in a rage of anger and the thought of smoking is never there. Same for being sad or having the "Monday Blues".  But let it be something good like, "ALRIGHT! That neighbor I hate is being exiled to Pakistan to be sold off into slavery!" and my mind seeks nicotine out of pure joy and excitement.      Luckily the only time I normally get excited is when I find a fantastic deal on clothing.       What about you?          
    Probably because while you smoked you were conditioned to see it as a reward for having completed a task or while out having a good time or whatever brought you joy.   For me it's boredom. When every I have nothing to do and no real focus I think I should be smoking to use up that time I guess?
    Stress is a big one for me. It's likely that the stress I felt was because of a need for a nicotine hit.    When I was anxious about starting new in work I'd never done before, I smoked more. Being worried about learning the work fast enough caused tension. As I became more proficient, i began smoking less. 
    Absolutely nothing.     There is an end, folks, it does go away.    EZPZ
    ^^^^^   I agree.  Cravings are gone, kaput, nada.    
I can't even remember the last time I had a desire to smoke.        In fact, and this should not be mistaken for complacency on my part, I can't think of one scenario in which I would ever choose to smoke a cigarette again.         2 hours ago, sgt.barney said:               There is an end, folks, it does go away.                Yep, what he said.
(First Posted 01 April 2014)  A crave can happen because of 2 things:  1. Physical Withdrawl Symptoms. 2. Mental or Emotional Smoking Triggers.  Craves can happen frequently early in our quits, because of physical withdrawl symptoms. They can also happen simultaneously with physical cravings and then later in our quits, much less frequently, as we continue to confront triggers which are mental or emotional in nature.  The important thing to remember, is that craves are *NEVER* a command !!!  You N.T.A.P. them (apply to them the concept of Never.Take.Another.Puff.....just for today) as they happen. Then what happens ???  Nothing. Absolutely.......*NOTHING* !!!  Your head does not explode when you say "NO" to a crave. You will not die. Life will continue, and the sun will continue to rise every day.....and so will you....and the crave will be gone and soon forgotten. At the same time, you re-program you brain and emotions to react to life as a non-smoker again. Craves create F.E.A.R. in your mind and emotions, but it is a false fear. F.E.A.R. = False.Expectations.Appearing.Real. In the case of smoking, the expectations that some horrible thing may happen if you do not yield to the crave, are ***FALSE***. The fear that craves create can appear real, if you give them life and continue to believe lies the addiction may tell you, and can seem like a command at the moment they come to you. But the reality of this fear, is that it is a fear based on lies. This fear generates a false command....a empty command, based on the lies of a addiction that has no intelligence, is in every way illogical, and exists only as a ghost in your brain.   If you do nothing when you experience a crave.....nothing happens. Ever. A crave based on illogical F.E.A.R. - False.Expectations.Appearing.Real.....is never a command.Do not listen to the nonsensensical illogical lies the addiction may tell you.Instead, N.T.A.P. these craves, and N.T.A.P. your way to the mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual freedom you so desparately want.  Cristóbal
Your head does not explode when you say "NO" to a crave. You will not die. Life will continue, and the sun will continue to rise every day.....and so will you....and the crave will be gone and soon forgotten. At the same time, you re-program you brain and emotions to react to life as a non-smoker again.  Whenever a crave it gnawing at you, remember that every single person here and the millions of those who've quit smoking also said NO.  That horrible crave that's pestering you will be long forgotten so long as you keep saying no because over time (mine was short), they all go away...for good.
Thank you so much for this!  Just what I needed to hear at this exact moment.

Mental or Emotional Smoking Triggers.                                    Craves can happen frequently early in our quits, because of physical withdrawl symptoms.                        They can also happen simultaneously with physical cravings and then later in our quits, much less frequently, as we continue to confront triggers which are mental or emotional in nature.                                  The important thing to remember, is that craves are *NEVER* a command !!!                                   You N.T.A.P. them (apply to them the concept of Never.Take.Another.Puff.....just for today) as they happen.                     Then what happens ???                                   Nothing.                        Absolutely.......*NOTHING* !!!                                  Your head does not explode when you say "NO" to a crave.                        You will not die.                       Life will continue, and the sun will continue to rise every day.....and so will you....and the crave will be gone and soon forgotten.                       At the same time, you re-program you brain and emotions to react to life as a non-smoker again.                     Craves create F.E.A.R. in your mind and emotions, but it is a false fear.                       F.E.A.R. = False.Expectations.Appearing.Real.                       In the case of smoking, the expectations that some horrible thing may happen if you do not yield to the crave, are ***FALSE***.                     The fear that craves create can appear real, if you give them life and continue to believe lies the addiction may tell you, and can seem like a command at the moment they come to you.                     But the reality of this fear, is that it is a fear based on lies.                       This fear generates a false command....a empty command, based on the lies of a addiction that has no intelligence, is in every way illogical, and exists only as a ghost in your brain.                                             If you do nothing when you experience a crave.....nothing happens.                      Ever.                       A crave based on illogical F.E.A.R. - False.Expectations.Appearing.Real.....is never a command.         Do not listen to the nonsensensical illogical lies the addiction may tell you.          Instead, N.T.A.P. these craves, and N.T.A.P. your way to the mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual freedom you so desparately want.                                    Cristóbal                   Bump for our fabulous newbies who are stronger and more powerful than any damn crave or smoky thought.

Just checking in to say hello and let you all know I am still going strong with my quit.  It has been 68 days since my last cigarette.  I have been keeping busy working lots to pay for Christmas and doing lots of baking.... I love baking.

    OMG IGT.... so super happy to see you are still with us.... thought we had lost you.... hmmm... definately think there were missed woohoo drinks, so very sorry.
    Wow T, who has time for smoking when they are baking such beautiful muffins!  Another one just breezing through her quit without a complaint!   Washington is a little far for me or I would come have a taste.   You definitely have a gift for baking.  Let us know when you open you own shop, we will put it on or bucket list! Keep that great quit going!  
    Good to see you igt, what a great quit you have going  Thanks for the update and the sweets craving lol
I gained 5 lbs just looking at that stuff!  Nice one. Becomes part of your family's Christmas tradition which is cool
Great quit IGT(T).  68 days is amazing!     I'd tell you not to blow it on 69, but that would be contradictory (har har).
    Congratulations T!  That's great!
    Great to here from you IGT, glad the quit is going strong.  Now to cool down from the food porn -- Oh so Gooood!!!
Thank you all!!! Here is what I made today on my day off. I made two batches of these..... this is what was left over from the first batch and the second batch is in the oven as I type.   Lemon blueberry muffins with a buttery crumb topping, powdered sugar and a lemon cream glazeEdited December 19, 2018 by I Got This (T)
    Thank you for checking in ! I am so happy you built yourself a mighty fine quit.    s
That is awesome.  Over two months quit, there is no reason to relapse at this point. You made it through the hardest parts.

Maybe do something that people often smoke after but just forego the smoke.
    Who first coined the H.A.L.T. acronym? In the past three days, I've gained a whole new respect for using it to rescue sanity from the clutch of addictive thinking. If I have it right, when a person feels s/he is in the grips of longing for nicotine, it may not be nicotine, but something else. Wires get crossed.    It could be Hunger, Anger/Annoyance, Loneliness, or Tired.      I don't know how many times in the past few days I've "HALTed." Each time, well most of the time, I reached a satisfactory conclusion that I needed something else, not a nicotine fix. Although the nicotine fix would have been nice, too, were it not destructive, expensive, and pointless.     I used to reach for a cigarette when I was hungry. When I've HALTed, the solution I come up with most often is to eat a piece of fruit because I sense my blood sugar is low.   Once, identifying lonely,  I reached out to my son (a young man with a family of his own). He and I are close. He doesn't know I smoke, so I didn't talk about smoking, just used a brief interaction to supplant nicotine craving.     HALT is so simple, yet so powerful. Stressor --> few deep breaths to gain calm --> ask the H.A.L.T. questions and be open to the answers --> focus on the best response and take action     Anyone else have success using this method? Do you use it often?
    I use this often - maybe that is why I gained so much weight when I quit...always went for a piece of dark chocolate! Been trying to just drink water lately!! It does work well when you are doing battle with a crave because you need to think and it gets your mind off the crave..... 
    Great post Kate and yes I've used it too 
    The nicotine addiction is in the part of your brain that would normally give you rewards for taking care of yourself.  Eat some food - reward for taking care of hungry.  In from the rain - reward for not being wet.  Get some sleep - reward for not being tired.  Nicotine hijacks this part of your brain so it mostly functions like:  Smoke cigarette - reward no panic inducing adrenaline dump.  You are retraining your brain to work properly.  It's a healing process, so it takes time and effort.  You'll see plenty of posts that discuss rewarding yourself often early in a quit to correct what nicotine has messed up.  
I do not remember how it came up at work but I asked this younger co-worker if he smoked. He said, "smoke what?" I said tobacco.        He said he didn't and asked if i did. I said i did for 15 years but gave it up over a year ago. He asked what it is like smoking cigarettes.        I said it was basically like being in a watered-down state of being stoned, like being in a slight daze constantly. I then said, "Of course if you go too long without a cigarette, your nerves go ape shit".   He said something about hearing that this was the reason it is so hard to quit.     I was like, "Oh yes, quitting is a bitch. But you know, I just got sick of feeling like i had to have it, I was coughing all the time, clothes be stankin'. After a while i was like "F*** smoking, I am tired of dealing with the hassle. I don't recommend that shit to anyone, it ain't worth it."   I wonder if I gave him the idea that smoking sucks?     Oh and then tonight i went to pick up my room mate from work. I was parked in a spot across from some rusty ol pickup. Some grown man with his pants down and his ass in plain site was digging around in his truck. And then the smell of a 1,000 cigarettes hit me. Tonight it was cold and damp and s us smokers know, that kind of weather REALLY amplifies the stench of cigarette smoke.      One benefit of quitting smoking is we get to complain now about smokers and how gross it is.

    ^^^ The choice SHOULD be obvious but unfortunately it's not to many. We all spent years protecting our addiction as hardily as we now protect our quits.    The time for a serious quit comes to us all sooner or later. Hopefully sooner for those following in our footsteps

Feeling so awesome in my quit!!!!merry christmas to me as a non smoker!!!and merry non smoking christmas to ALL of you!!!
    Good to hear  And, Merry Non-Smoking Christmas to you as well!
    Great to hear you are feeling comfortable in your lovely Quit...    Wishing you a Merry Xmas ...and a Prosperous New Year xx
    Glad to hear parsley, and merry Christmas to you too 
    Yay Parsley !   It will get even better, bebe.  HO HO HO to your too.
    Parsley, you and I must be in the same place.  I feel the same about my quit.  Is this not the best Christmas gift ever.  You have a very Merry Christmas and a Wonderful New Year!
    Merry Christmas to you too, Parsley!  I'm glad you are feeling awesome.
    Merry Christmas Parsley, looks like you are doing well.  Enjoy the holidays especially that you are smoke free!!!
G’day   I have a quit... he’s 3. I’m very proud of him. Course I am, I’m a parent!  But he’s 3. He’s just a toddler. He’s curious willfull and ready to explore the world.  But there are dangers out there. My job is to protect. I’m a parent and that’s what I do.   I set boundary’s. They don’t just restrict. They give a protective zone for my quit to grow strong and experience the world. As he grows up against those barriers it time to loosen them and let him grow some more.   There is one that will never be lossened and that ones NOPE.    Not One Puff Ever.  Its a quit killer. Simple as that.  That line in the sand that can’t be crossed.    Like I said....     I’m a parent. It’s my duty  To Love
    LOVE ^^^^
    I love this too.  There is nothing more precious than a child.  To look at our quit in these terms lets us know that it needs to be held dear and protected.    The wisdom on this forum abounds!
    We are heading into that time of year and, even though I feel confident in my quit, I am a little fearful of the holidays.  They use to be such a great joy and spiritual fulfillment for me but over the last couple of years I have come to dread them.   My emphasis was always on having that loving memory that was going to be left behind.  What always occurred was more like one of those comedies you see at the movies.  I always got through by sneaking upstairs to the bathroom and having my smoke out the window.   Every year I start fresh with that hope and end with such disappointment.  I know you will all tell me to go away for the holidays but I can't.  I know my grand kids look forward to Grandma's homemade sticky buns and my son is single and does not have a family besides us.  This might be the last year with my dad.  His health is declining.    No one has the perfect get together and I am sure that even though things do not go as planned, we will probably still look back and find something good about them.    I know the longer I stay quit, the more powerful I become.  Maybe my fear this year is that I may be too outspoken for everyone.  I might just finally not put up with some peoples sh**t.  Whatever, I just wanted to get this out there as we head into the holidays.  You are all so great at redirecting my thoughts and helping me through.    .   
The holidays will be so much better without missed moments for smoking!!(and all the stress of thinking you could hide it)  You might need family around more than you think as you just experienced a close loss.  I know your parents make you nuts, so take your breaks still...make an excuse to go out to the garage and scream into a pillow...go out in the yard and see if you can find a good stick    Enjoy EVERY. SINGLE. MOMENT. with those grandkids and don't let anyone stop you from giving them all the love and attention they deserve. I'm a little sad I will miss out on the sticky buns. (your husband enjoys them the most, I bet)   Get sassy if you have to...sometimes people get used to walking all over us and won't stop until we stand up for ourselves. My mother in law is like that with her daughters and expected she could give me the same treatment when I married her son, but I set boundries real quick. Now, she doesn't "tell me" to do anything; she asks politely when she talks to me  The holidays are just another part of the quit...the things we have to learn to do as a non-smoker and we will do it together! Edited November 15, 2018 by c9jane29
    Sweetheart ,    With all the hype that leads up to Xmas....it easy to sit and reflect when things are not as perfect as we would like .....and wish some area,s in our life were different ...I'm with you on this .    I have learnt over the years ,to just except things ...and it's only a short time ...   Sometimes thinking about a situation makes our brains go in overload.....just stick to NOPE...you are a stronger person now.....one who will speak her mind and I know you will do just fine .. This is the first Xmas of many smoke free...that something to cheer about ...I'll raise my glass to that....
    Hugs, Linda, I know that holidays isn’t the easiest time and you’ve had tough moments recently. Just be nice to yourself and enjoy what is good. 
    Linda I wish I had some amazing advice but all I can suggest is to just roll with it.       You said "My﻿﻿ emphasis was always on having that loving memory that was﻿ going to be left behind." Just remember that whatever the adults do you are still building those memories for your grandchildren.     You got this        ﻿﻿
    Oh Linda, I know from experience that the anxiety leading up to the holidays is much worse than the actual holiday. Many others have said the same. Hopefully you will be pleasantly surprised at all the free time you now have to be present in the moment.   Stink free hugs for all, sticky buns (so jealous!). And hey, if you find the need for the new and improved Linda to speak her mind, GO FOR IT!  And lastly, you always have your family here to come and vent to 
    Linda, repeat after me.....ONE DAY AT A TIME! You do have the power now (you quit smoking!! Nothing more empowering than that, right?) and you will get through the holidays remembering just that! 
    The Holidays are much better smoke free

Ahhhh.....the horror daze/holidays  Expectations are on overload.   When you want to escape, escape and breathe clean cool air.  Slow down your breathing.  Remember HALT.  Feed yourself.  Rest well.  Let your feelings be feelings, give them attention.         Enjoy your grandkids.   Tell people you love that you love them.    Eat too many sticky buns.   Warm up your husband's bum. Play with your canines. Remove yourself from uncomfortable situations,  the door is always open.    Stand up straight, tits first, chin up. Un-clench your fists, lol.  Use your power. Communicate your perimeters.    Have FUN.   You don't smoke anymore.             Edited November 16, 2018 by Sazerac

I just read your check in Linda, what wonderful news that your son will be hosting thanksgiving in his new home  You probably won't even have one craving since you've never smoked there! When I bought my new car in 2007 I decided it would never have a cigarette smoked in it. So in my early months if I craved I would jump in my car and take a drive somewhere and the crave would disappear
    Sounds like you will have no trouble enjoying your first Smoke-Free holiday season! I would even say that you'll be coming here to tell us what a relief it was not to have to run off every hour or so to feed the beast! You are in for a real treat this year Linda - more time spent with your loved ones and a chance to show off the New You

He is 38.  He had his heart broken years ago.  I also don't think he will find a girl now because he has stinky ferrets as pets.     He has promised me Thanksgiving will be fun this year.  He says if Grandma gets out of line, he is going to let his stinky rodents loose!
You can do this!  I quit just 3 weeks before a Thanksgiving holiday, and just 7 weeks before Christmas, and looking back I wouldn't have done it any other way.  The confidence you've earned from being free of your addiction is a treasure, and sharing that joy wtih all of the folks coming to visit will make you feel great.  Enjoy everyone's company and quirks and let them pull whatever S&*& they want - stay enveloped in your happiness in being free Edited November 23, 2018 by JOD
Be sure to enjoy the benefits of your best holiday gift ever.....your quit !!!      Stay focused on being able to smell and taste your holiday food - think of it while enjoying every holiday meal, it will blow away any trigger thoughts that you may have.      Be sure to watch Joel´s video about the holidays:               Cristóbal    Edited November 24, 2018 by Cristóbal
    Hi @Linda Thomas, I was just thinking about you and hoping today went well 
11 hours ago, jillar said:              Hi @Linda Thomas, I was just thinking about you and hoping today went well  It went very well.  I actually did not have time for smoky thoughts the day of the event.  I do, however, find myself pretty crabby still, when I am under pressure.  Fortunately, my husband would rather have a crabby nonsmoker and still loves me . I do think it was a little more work having it at my son's home and I am really tired today.    My son spent all his time building his dining room table, which he finished the night before.  When my son is focused on something, everything else suffers.    Mom spent two days, going over to his house to help him organize and clean for the big event.  He probably will never have  cleaner toilets.    I did find it very hard relinquishing the turkey rights.  I laid in bed worrying about him stuffing the bird properly and it took every ounce of power in me not to get up at 5:00 a.m. and go over to his house to help him stuff it.  Everything turned out great.  Food was wonderful, and everyone behaved themselves.  One holiday down, only one more to go!  I'm attaching a picture of my son's table.  Pretty proud of that kid.  Lighting was not the greatest but I think you can see enough of it.  He now wants to build the chairs to go with it.  My elderly dad is at the corner of the table.  Brother-in-law in the doorway.   Edited November 25, 2018 by Linda Thomas
    Glad to hear you got through the day with no casualties.    the table looks amazing!    Re-training the brain...    Dont dread these events, instead embrace them and look forward to them as a non-smoker...it's something you need o be proud of...your family and friends are proud of you for it.   Well done!!  
    Wow !!!!    That is one mighty big table....it's fabulous.....  Well done for enjoying the time ....not really bothered about smoking....our minds are our worst enemies....always over thinking... You done it...the next one will be a doddle....high five Linda !!!!
    Oh I'm so glad to hear that Linda, and what a talented son you have. That table is gorgeous! 
    Oh, Linda,  I am so glad TGvng went well and your worries didn't manifest themselves.   The table is beautiful. (perfect to cut out fabric on !)    Is Son hosting XMas too ?       I hope you are taking time to replenish yourself.

    Yay for you, Linda! The empowerment you get from quitting smoking spills over into all areas of your life and is a wonderful thing!
    This is one of the greatest benefits of quitting yet it's one we never expect to receive when we start out. Good job Linda!  
    You have built a beautiful quit, Linda  and your strength and inner fortitude is an inspiration to all of us.   It was just under the surface but, gangster-ed by nicotine. You have blossomed, for sure    and the gifts you bring to the board are truly awesome. Thank you.  S 
Some quit on a whim, others quit making a sensible planand mapping it all out as best they can,there are many successful quits between the extremes.The important bit is the seminal moment in your life when you say,'I'm going to quit smoking'.       I spontaneously said,'I'm going to quit.If I don't feel better in a few days, I can always smokebut, let's see your mettle and give this an honest try'I had no idea the process took a lot longer than a few days.I had no concept at all about nicotine addiction.  I was supremely ignorant.     To be honest, it actually takes nicotine a lot longerthan a few days to completely leave your body.     Think about it...we have nicotine infested tar in our lungs clinging to our cilia.  Tar, ffs. This doesn't disapate in a few days.Ever have tar on your feet ?  It takes a solvent like gasoline to remove it.The miracle is that our bodies do purge themselves of most.  Still, remnants remain.  Remants remain forever in our DNA.A sobering fact.  After a few days, gathering more knowledge about addiction,I extended the premise of starting smoking again'if I don't feel better in ...days...weeks...'but some days, I thought, if I don't feel better in five minutes I can always smoke.There were many times when acknowledging the choice saved my quit.     My decision to quit smoking heldand my resolve to commit to this choice grew minute by minute.It grew by quantumn leaps every damn crave I beat.    I'm sharing this thinking about smokers on the fence,before the choice to quit becomes clear and non negotiable.You may not have a serious dose of resolve about your decision to quit.     Do not worry about this,resolve grows with knowledge and time.After a while there should be no turning back,you will know too much and will have power to commit to your decision.  The decision to quit smoking is one of the best decisions you can make in your life.            
        Great post Sally, thank you for sharing 
    Quit on a whim or plan a quit. Ive did both. Planning doesnt 'prepare' you. It just prolongs the inevitable. That scared, uncertainty you feel when you begin a quit... we all feel...whether planned or not. You never feel 'ready' to quit. You just have to go for it, with gusto!   I had seven planned quits prior to this on a whim quit, so i am all for on a whim quits. But know, of course, planned quits do work also. Horses for courses, we are all individuals. Just Not One Puff Ever! Make ya mind up and go for it!

Very nice post Saz that captures the essence of our early quit      I think many of us are the same Sslip! No clue at first and full of fear and trepidation over what will happen to us as we start out on this journey.   After a while, we realize hey, maybe we CAN actually do this because we are making good progress toward our ultimate goal.      You just passed your 6 month mark. Can you even imagine giving up all you have fought for to date - NOPE!Edited July 10, 2018 by reciprocity
    My only plan was to keep hold of my two feet ..that were in danger of leaving my body ,if I continued to smoke..    I had to make the decision ..keep the quit and feet...or smoke and amputation....   This is as real as it gets folks... Thankfully.. I chose correctly....

    Quitting....its not normally something you just happen upon by accident though is it sarge? A decision to quit comes before most quits, so nothing to be scoffed at.

You haven't actually started to quit at the moment you make that decision. Sure, some don't act on their decision but others do. Some, like you, me and a lot of others here, acted on that decision to quit and are still doing so. It really boils down to how badly you want it once you make that decision.
    It has to be a decision to quit...then choose to do it ..or not..   Your right millions make a decision, and don't quit..but isn't that thier choice to do nothing...   If I make a decision to make a cheese sandwich and don't...that's my choice... And I missed out on a dam good butty....  
    I certainly made the decision to quit   and made the decision to commit to my quit. Everyday I make this decision.  Everyday I stand by my decision.        Usually when thoughtful decisions take precedence over my actions   chaos remains at bay.   When actions take precedence over thoughtful decisions....  Well.  You.  Can.  Imagine.      
The rush of 2019 resolutions may be swirling around.    Quitting smoking and dealing with Nicotine Addiction is a popular one and ultimately do-able.   You can quit smoking.  We quit smoking and we are not special, just committed.      You will gain the gifts of self-confidence and trust in yourself.   It is a supreme gift to give your family and loved ones,  as well as yourself.  Nobody wants to witness or experience a life of nicotine addiction, a smoking related illness or a horrifying death.    Nobody. So, consider quitting smoking.  If you are a new quitter or an elder, protect your quit.  You have won.
I still get that sense of pride ...I quit .....I won....even after five years...    I beat the nico monster after 52 years .... If I can ...you can too.....what have you got to lose ...nothing ....but just imagine what you can gain !!!!
Or if you're like me and make your New Year's resolution each year to quit smoking but then break it, consider quitting before New Years and start 2019 as an ex smoker

Especially this part, above.      When I got my new job at a health food store, I said to myself that I'd quit when I started the job--we're strictly forbidden to smell like smoke.  Instead, I figured out how to not smell like smoke. (Elaborate, won't even go there.)       The new job came with medical insurance--tons cheaper for nonsmokers.   So every pack I smoked was definitely going to be the last pack. I was resolved, every time.  Months.       I opted in for smoking cessation coaching with the health insurance company so they'd know I was serious about quitting.  I knew the clock was ticking and I'd have to actually quit.   December 14th was the drop dead date, conclusion of the program.        December 12th I passed a trash can and tossed in what I had left of cigarettes.     What was I thinking?! Perfectly good cigarettes! I could have smoked for two more days!  Yes, seriously, what was I thinking?       You said, "you may not have a serious dose of resolve about your decision to quit."  That was true for me, I wasn't seriously resolved about quitting on the day when I quit; I was seriously ruminating on how I could keep smoking for as long as possible. For that day, I had put on a patch and was just going to not smoke during the day. I planned to smoke again that night. Just in case I felt panicked at lunch break, I had them with me in my purse. I'd remove the patch and smoke.      Now I've been through three days of refusing to smoke (nights don't count; I'm asleep). I've thought about starting up and quitting later. If I hadn't returned to this forum and posted, I know I'd have gone back to smoking. I'm reading through posts and being reminded of the great things I learned at the QSMB and Joel Spitzer's library, etc. It's great to find that wisdom through people posting at Quittrain. I think you're right, Sazerac. I think that as long as I stay here, keep learning and being reminded about being free of smoking/nicotine, resolve will grow, power will grow.  I'm not going to get complacent about having quit, I don't trust myself any further than the next few hours, but I do take heart with your post about a person reaching a point where knowledge and power make it possible to stay quit.    At this moment, I really, really (etc) want a cigarette. The only reason I don't have one in my hand right now is that I am typing this. And editing it. I need a doughnut.
Have a doughnut @Kate18, you deserve it  Quitting ain't for sissies that's for sure so take this time to spoil yourself. Listen to your body as it heals from all the damage done over the years. If it's tired, sleep. If it's hungry, eat. This is the time to be selfish and focus on yourself and quitting. What a great way to start 2019 right?!

I was going to sleep early to dispel disturbing intrusive thoughts.As I was making coffee, I had fearful images of something terrible happening to my children and theirs. Made me weepy.  Felt strongly motivated to go to the gas station and buy cigarettes."This is biochemical," I said to myself. Slapped on a patch.  Just deal with the stress of changing habits first, then chemical withdrawal. One step at a time. One day at a time. Until this patch kicks in right now, and my monkey-mind quiets down and stops projecting tragic images, I'm taking one minute at a time. I really, really want a smoke. Fortunately, I have to get ready for work.
    If taking it minute by minute helps ....then good ....  Please don't believe the cigarette offers you something ....it's the opposite ...it makes you more stressed ....    Please take the time Kate to read everything you can here....once you see smoking for what it really is and does to us ...the quit becomes easier...

It's a curious feeling, to have wanted so badly to smoke, but for once, I didn't.  I credit this forum for a lot of the strength I found to stay free of cigarettes Edited December 17, 2018 by Kate18
Didn't remember to put on a nic patch, so felt the full brunt of withdrawal today. The old panic returned.  To escape it, I slept for a while.  Just took another sleep sedative and my evening vitamins and supplements. It's not yet 6:00 pm, but I'm heading off to sleep anyway.        I I can just make it through today--historically the day when I've failed before--then I think I'll find the strength and resolve to make it through day 4 and on.  Have been dangerously close to saying "screw it, I want the relief of tension."  Staying on the QT and reading, watching videos for a while was a counterbalance on the side of health and freedom.     Thanks to those of you who checked in to the pre-SOS thread where I was working through, in real time, the cravings and the H.A.L.T. exercise. I appreciate your words of encouragement.
    Have a nice nights sleep Kate and when you wake up danger day with be a thing of the past that you'll never have to face again 
    How ya doing Kate ????  A new day ....a new NOPE...we all took it one day at a time...your doing great...feel proud ...your fighting that demon..   Make sure your kind  to yourself...nice Candle soaks...treats....it's so important ....plenty of  juice ....stay close ..

There is such a vast difference between the board members. I put on my pants one leg at a time, reciprocity doesn't appear to wear pants.       You folks have been great. I'm not one for change really. It took me something like 273,000 smokes to figure out that I could stop. I really need/needed a place to vent/rant so that I wouldn't go outside and have number 273,001.        There is a common bond already between us, once we get to know one another you'll get to understand that keeping the coocoo inside the clock is tough with all of us :-)        I really do miss going back and reading some of the things that I used on the old board. My own posts from as far back as 2014 were some of my motivation for no wanting to ever quit again.        The people on the board are sometimes what helps me not smoke. Knowing that if I just come hear and write, and read, and read, and write, that enough time will have passed that I won't need a smoke. It is a very fragile thing for me, there were folks on Q that I used as mentors and there are folks that I want to help in their quit. It's therapeutic for me.  Something I finally came to terms with because of a few special folks is that I am a NICOTINE ADDICT. I can not help myself if I smoke. Not a single puff.      A little time, and a little trust, and we will be one big neurotic family who doesn't lite things on fire and put them in our mouths.       I wish you all peace in your quit   R

It is a shame in that it had such a rich history and was a thriving community at different points in time.

I personally think the new owners bought the name quitsmoking.com to sell their quit smoking products only and that there was nothing to gain by keeping the message board going. The store was updated and their products are sold through several different sites including Amazon. There is no need to maintain a forum in their view.   Like Johnny5 said we are very fortunate to have this site, provided to us by a former smoker, welcome us all no strings attached. I thank you again  Marylandquitter and everyone else who have welcomed us unconditionally.
    You know though, the tobacco companies hate forums like this. A place where even a few people encourage others not to smoke and KTQ. They hate it. Big tobacco loses money because of forums like this or any quit site.    So whether you are from QT, QSMB, or any other, we all have this in common -    We are, by NOT opening our wallets to big tobacco, telling them to cram it in their asses.
^^^^ This  ^^^^^        We are group of good people who refuse to be ruled by the big tobacco companies... Who don't care how many good people they kill...just to make money...    We are fighting the same fight...   This is us saying ...NOPE ..... 2 boards ..or 1.board....the fight is the same....  Quitting with a group is much more fun...

Another one who is made up to have found this place after the demise of QSMB. Glad to see many of the regulars from QSMB on here aswell. I joined QSMB around my quit day of 1/1/18 and was really helped by the site. Been struggling a bit this past week or two but still a non smoker, and still fully determined.      I'm sure my quit will get an added boost  now I'm back amongst my fellow quitters.
    Welcome tocevoD! Glad to hear your young quit is still in place  There are many old friends here and some new ones to make as well. The great part is, we're all quitters and here to help others. Buckle up your seat belt and enjoy your ride on Quit Train!

Hello, all! I'm so happy to have "found" you! I had a moment a couple of days ago where some smoking thoughts started creeping in and I got online to come to QSMB and found it wasn't there. I must say I was in a bit of shock. I then remembered Quit Train. So happy to find you all here! Did everyone know that QSMB was going away or did it just happen out of the blue? I'm just wondering if everyone over on the other site knew/knows about Quit Train? Does anyone have the 2017 Smokebusters logo? I'd like to put it back on my profile. Thanks and good to see you all!
Welcome Gigi...all the 'answers' to you questions ate on previous pages of this thread... Wuitbustets logo is on page 2.

    Did anyone use a program like HTTrack to make a copy of the qsmb at some point before it went down? I know that when it went down previously there was some talk of doing that for private use. Please pm if you have heard anything about this.

I am so grateful so many of you found your way here....I know in the first year of my quit (even 2) I would have panicked if the place I called home just vanished..along with my family on there.  I would have been so lost.  With the amount of people here from the qsmb, I can imagine it feels as close to home as can be and that must be such a comfort.  Plus....we have so many new people to get to know and join together in the war against nicotine addiction!  Love the energy here!  I am excited for the quittrain and for all of you!     a big HUGE welcome!!

I hadn't been coming as much and even though I don't think about smoking as much, I think I need to remind myself to come more often and to never really let my guard down. I lost another quit a few years ago because I became too complacent and fell into the "I can have just one trap". I won't let that happen again. Plus, it's good to keep up with everyone and touch base to see how everyone is. I always appreciate your kind words and your advice. Hope you stick around too!
    There is room for everybody here..all you need...is the desire to quit smoking...hold tight.....

    Welcome Kazza and Devo.  It is great to see you again!
    Hello, everyone! I was away when it was decided to combine QSMB with this board. So....I thought that the old board had been lost. I guess it is. I just found some familiar members names and realized that this was the place.        I have to start all over again. I was unable to locate my user name and password. Or did everyone had to get new passwords?         Well anyway, I’m here!      Im still smoke free! Hope everyone is well.  
    Thanks for the welcoming quit train!
I’m so confused. I was an original member of QSMB since 2013 and joined here when MQ created the quit train. I see some wonderful original members and a lot of new ones.       Cant believe QSMB was   lost so easily but so glad the beat goes on. Love to all of you quitters!       Betsy.
    I found it! I could NOT remember the name of the board that I was on before. I don't even remember my username there. I remember a lot of faces, uh names, here though. I wasn't there very long and obviously my quit failed.      Well, I'm back! 
    ^^^ I bump into some on here and also on social media, marcus angelina and nerdirl i havnt run into unfortunately, i hope they pop in here one day and hopefully all KTQ and doing well 
    There are plenty more carriages ....and seats...
    I am so happy y'all found us and grateful we all landed on a safe site,.    Thanks to MQuitter for the sanctuary, you are a hero.
    The saddest part (to me) is all of the posts from   jwg are gone. The only reason that I went back there every now and again was to read him. His posts inspired my quit.       I am so happy that you all found your way here.

Hi all! I too just discovered the site was gone. I'm coming up on 4 years smoke free and wanted to check in...but there was no site to check in on!!!!! Glad to see familiar names
    Hi MrsMelanie, glad you found the train. Congratulations on almost four years quit! 
    QSMB was awesome, I missed the people there
The train is fricking amazing... you will love it, hang around, give us a chance and enjoy the ride. When is your 4 year anni?
Welcome to QuitTrain, MrsMelanie.  Congratulations on almost 4 years smoke free!
    Welcome aboard MM....   Take a seat and enjoy the ride...there are quite a few familiar friends here...and you can make some new ones ...   I'm sure you will have plenty to offer our newbies ...  Congrats on your fabulous quit ...
Sitting with my coffee at my computer desk, but mentally I am wandering aimlessly, detouring around the furry little weasel in my mind that promises feeling better if I go out to buy cigarettes.  Two hours ago I was on the phone with my smoking cessation coach (with my health insurance company), talking about my strategy to stay quit. Oh, how quickly the challenge appears.     An observation I've made is that when I was hungry, I would reach for a cigarette.  (Apparently a common occurrence)    At the moment I feel an urge to smoke, so I ask, "am I just hungry?" Maybe. Not really, but eating would be better than smoking.        With this new eating plan -- plant-based diet, low sodium, and low gluten -- I have nothing left to eat in the house that appeals to me. Gone are the quick nachos and grilled tuna sandwiches. It's cold outside, so the thought of a cold salad isn't appealing. Cooking rice, beans, etc, takes too long.  (K'vetch, k'vetch)        That sneaky little weasel is popping its head around posts and pillars in my mind like a cartoon character and he's suggesting that all of this restlessness and aimlessness would go away with a cigarette. Then I could just quit again after I finished the pack.        Yaaaahhhh, nooooo, I've been here before. Saying, "yes, I'll quit, but not today," proved to not be a good strategy. On those other occasions, I went out and got the cigarettes, settled on my patio with a cup of coffee, smoked a cigarette, felt the relief from tension, and so reinforced the dependency on a cigarette/nicotine.         The furry, sneaky little weasel is cute, but I already have a dog and can't afford to keep another pet. On my way to work, instead of stopping for cigarettes, I'll stop at the Humane Society and surrender the weasel.  I'm sure someone else will give him a good home.   Edited December 14, 2018 by Kate18
Yes Kate, surrender that nasty weasel! May I also suggest that for the first few months you allow yourself to eat what ever you're craving. This addiction is hard enough to fight without throwing in a complete diet change. We especially crave sweets when we quit, and they help with the dizziness and spacey feeling you may notice. So I really recommend getting yourself at the very leat some fruit and/orfruit juice to help with those. Sucking on candies is also a great distraction from smoking as I never ate anything and smoked at the same time. I lived on those soft peppermint puffs. You're doing great and you should be really proud of yourself  Edited December 14, 2018 by jillar
    The iNco monster is playing with you...tell it to go and do one ...your not playing his game ...    You are stronger than him...    Be kind to you yourself....what you are achieving is wonderful...   Your body has alot of healing to do....
    I like your humor Kate.  The ladies on the forum kept me smiling through my first weeks.  You are doing great.  Just keep redirecting that crave.  
https://www.quittrain.com/topic/7166-riffing-on-halt/?tab=comments#comment-239005
    You know that that little bugger will tempt you ever chance it's gets so just fight it every time it whispers sweet lies in your head. Every battle you win, it gets weaker and you get stronger. Little by little YOU win!     Remember that ALL it promises you are lies. You said so much in your post here today. You know your addiction only cares about itself and not you so why even consider assisting it?        What does it really want? It needs you to feed it - yes, your addiction is powerless if you refuse to participate so tell it to piss-off!  These early days are uncomfortable - no question but only temporary so dig in and keep battling this A-hole because you know it's the right thing to do and we all know you can do it!
    Keep fighting through this, Kate.  It can be a tough battle but as long as you don't light up, you got this, and things will get better.

Thanks, Paul. It's exactly right and I'll put it on my refrig to remind me.
I have noticed a lot of people who hopped off the Quit Train jumping back on in the past few weeks.This is awesome.     So for those of you out there who in the past few weeks have tossed the smokes and taken up the challenge to quit again I just wanted you to know we have your back and are so happy that you have decided to quit again.Welcome Back.  May this be your sticky quit.   My you learn from your last quit (however short or long it was) and take those lessons with you to help you KTQ.    My you have a long future ahead of you as a non-smoker.      Edited July 11, 2018 by notsmokinjo
    Always this. Whether it is a slip or a relapse, if you are ready to go again we're here. Learn, share your experience and let's help one another fight the tough times and celebrate the good. 
    Dear fellow addicts,    There is no shame in failure, only an opportunity to learn.     Personal responsibility is one thing and you must, of course, own your success or your relapse  but, please remember we are dealing with ADDICTION which is outside most of our consciousnesses.    The first part of any successful quit is admitting an addiction to nicotine and we must learn and understand all we can in order to put it down.        According to The National Institute on Drug Abuse,  "Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences. It is considered a brain disease because drugs change the brain—they change its structure and how it works. These brain changes can be long-lasting, and can lead to the harmful behaviors seen in people who abuse drugs.      Quitting smoking may not be a walk in the park but, it will bring you physical and emotional benefits that are astounding.  It is not impossible.  You will live through any discomfort.    We all quit and we may think of ourselves as Super men and women but, we are just like you. Nicotine addicts.       I encourage you to put this dangerous and deadly addiction to rest and start enjoying your freedom, your newfound confidence, your beautiful life.      love,   S
I often wonder why I chose January 29th 2017 to quit smoking. The answer is, I have no idea. What I do know is that was the right time for me! Why was the time right? I have no clue about that either. My point is that on Jan, 29th 2017 ..... MY time was right! For whatever reason I was able to cement my quit and have so far extended it to this point.        What is the right time for YOU to quit? I have no idea and you may not either but that shouldn't ever stop you from trying. This could very well be the right time for your life long quit. Don't miss that opportunity. Many remain here in this community because it gave so much to us as we crafted our quits and we want nothing more than to do the same for all of you. Whether it be your first attempt or your 4th or 5th attempt, we are here to do whatever we can to support you so gather your resolve and jump in! Nothing to lose and everything to gain
    Never give up...trying to give up.. What have you got to lose ....nothing ....but everything to gain... This is a killer addiction....  Smoking has killed more people ...than all the wars have....    These are  good folks ..loved ones ..taken far to early...  Don't just become a number ...  A little discomfort... For a while ...is better than a smoking related illness ..or worse...     
Great thread jo, I agree with all the above and also want to welcome back all you quitters. I truly believe that being a member of a forum and having the support of fellow quitters all over the world is the reason for my success. The daily NOPES, the investing in others quits and having others invested in mine helped hold me accountable. I highly recommend joining a support forum if for nothing more than to NOPE each day. And you never know, you just may end up with some lasting friendships, a couple of laughs and a lifelong quit Edited July 13, 2018 by jillar

    I love this thread.     Never stop trying!! 
    Think this needs a bump.... also... this time of year is hard in the early days of a quit, there are functions and parties all the time for the festive season... often someone who has quit will slip up during this time while out celebrating with friends and have a smoke and throw away their quit.... Its right to feel bad about it, all that hard work lost, all that effort up in smoke... it is right to be disappointing in yourself BUT don't beat yourself up too much... it is a very rare bread of smoker who is able to quit successfully on their very first go.... most of us have failed quits under our belts, some only a few hours old, some days, weeks, months or even years... but you know what you do... you get back on the quit train as soon as you.... you learn from your failed quit... what triggered you to smoke, how or what you could have done to avoid it and you don't make that mistake again... doesn't mean you wont make more mistakes, just learn from the ones you do... take those lessons, remember how wonderful your success felt and remember how low failing felt... pick yourself up, dust yourself off and get back on the Quit Train.... we have a seat here with your name on it.... we want you to come back... we want you to try again... so please do, please come back... take if from someone who wait well more than a decade to quit again after throwing away a really long quit.... the sooner you quit again the easier and better for you.     NEVER GIVE UP GIVING UP!

Made it 12 hours.   7:30 am, smoked a cigarette. I want to sort out what's the trigger, nicotine withdrawal, or the psychological habit. Put on a nicotine patch.   7:45 am, car needed gas. As I walked toward the mini mart to prepay for gasoline, I tossed the remaining cigarettes I had into the trash receptacle that was just outside the entry door.   1:00 pm, lunch time. Fought the urge to go and buy cigarettes. That's habit speaking, I reminded myself, not nicotine withdrawal, because I wasn't in withdrawal.   5::30 pm. Off work. Normally would have headed to my car, lighting up on the way. Urge to light up; thought about stopping and getting cigarettes. Identified it as habit, not withdrawal.  6:00 pm. Passed the drug store I used to buy cigarettes at. Debated at the left turn lane red light: do I stop and buy cigarettes, or keep going? It was habit grating on my nerves, not withdrawal.    6:10 pm. Safely at home. Walked the dog, then fed her. Feeling at loose ends. While she eats her dinner, I used to go out on the patio and smoke a cigarette. Instead, I sat at my computer desk, doing nothing, missing smoking.   6:30 pm. Made a humongous salad. Filling, but not satisfying. Made pancakes. Craving something sweet. Poured maple syrup on them.   6:55 pm. Wanted the smoke I used to have after dinner.  7:00 pm. Watched three episodes of Criminal Minds, cravings creeping into my mind about every 30 minutes. Told myself that this is habit, the mind creating tension because of the change.  9:57 pm. I made it through 12 hours. Actually 14 1/2 hours. Tomorrow is another day. I'm taking this a few hours at a time. When I have the psychological urge to smoke replaced with stronger thoughts and healthier habits, then I'll address the nicotine  addiction.    I actually think that the psychological habit/urge may be more of a problem than the nicotine desire for me.  Not sure, yet.    Got up the courage to put up a ticker. And may I never have to replace it with a differently dated one. But trusting myself to keep the commitment....not 100%. I've been here too many times before. I'm better armed with everyone's advice, participation in a preparation to quit program with my health insurance company, and this forum. Thanks to everyone who posted the thread where I reported my father's death. I really appreciate your advice and thoughts for strength. One hour at a time. The next eight won't be difficult. I'll be asleep. Only time I don't have to talk myself out of acting on a craving.
    Congratulations!  Looks like we have the same quit date.
Congratulations! You have made the best decision ever.   I'll share a few things I learned during my quit as I also used the patch. That was 11 years ago. I'm not sure if this is your first quit but it doesn't really matter. What matters is where you are now. You understand that you are going through a behavior change as well as a physiological change in your body. You will need something to help you with the "oral" fix. There are many good suggestions. One that seems very successful if cutting up straws to the same size as cigarettes and putting one in your mouth. You can go through the whole reach for the smokes, put it in your mouth and suck routine that you are used to .     Some quick tips-     That drug store that you used to buy your smokes at. Don't avoid it, confront it. I used to go to Walmart once a week and look the large wall of cigarette cartons. I'd stare them right down and say aloud "You CAN'T have me! I win, you lose!". It worked.   The patch- you will come to a point where you need to get rid of the patch or you will just be getting the nicotine from there. When that time comes buy some small square band aids. I used to put the band aid on the same part of my body where the patch had been. I basically "fooled" myself into thinking I was still getting nicotine. This worked amazingly well and the final withdrawal was almost painless.    Just remember- Smoking is not the answer, it never was.  Once you quit smoking, you need to deal with whatever it was that was really bothering you. You must develop different copying mechanisms but you will and you will succeed.  Just tell your self that you have no choice. I wish you the best!
You have got some great help tip from Andi above. There really are two parts to the quitting thing, at least in my mind. The physical addiction to Nicotine and the psychological part of smoking (that's the habit part you refer to Kate). If you are using NRT products then you are cutting down o the nicotine intake gradually, which is of benefit to many quitters but, you still have to deal with the psychological part which to me was the most difficult and longest adjustment but .... it's very doable if you put some thought into distracting yourself in order to use up all the spare time you will suddenly have. In the early days, do anything to use that time up. Change up your daily routine in small ways just so you have a NEW routine.Replace morning coffee with juice. Have a morning shower or if you did that before, take it at a slightly different time. Just small changes will help. If you went out for a smoke at a certain time, go for a short walk now even if it;s just around the house once or twice - be creative.     Just always remember; quitting smoking won't harm you in any way. Sure, it can be challenging and uncomfortable for a bit but that is just temporary. It does get better for everyone who continues to say NOPE each day! Every person here who has been quit for awhile will tell you the same thing. They just love the new lifestyle they have now as a non-smoker. No longer the slave to their nicotine addiction. Having to service it whenever it demands. And that doesn't mean just smoking but all the preparation work. Making sure you have smokes and lighters and somewhere to go to smoke and on,. and, on and on it goes. Embrace your new freedom! It may such right now but it won;t for long      By the way, congrats to both of you new quitters for getting through the early hours of your quits! Not easy in those early days but so worthwhile in the long run!Edited December 13, 2018 by reciprocity
    Hi Kate, congrats on a day quit already, that's great  Love the clues @Andi has given. I'm a huge supporter of the air cigarette as it helped me immensely my first few months quit. The bandaid trick is a great idea too and one I hadn't heard before but if it works as good as the air cig does I will definitely be passing that clue along to others      
    Kate,   Please commit to yourself and your quit.    It is the only way.  Fake it until you make it, kiddo.   
    G’day   you really are proforming a death defying feat......    C 
    Kate, you can do this.  Don't over think it. Everyday you go without a cigarette,  you will begin to feel so much better about yourself.  Hang tough and stay close. 
    Well done Kate ...freeing yourself from this killer addiction is the. Most rewarding thiing you can ever do.....    The rewards are endless...  One day at a a time ......  You can do it ...you just need to believe in yourself ...
    Great stuff, Kate.  Just take it one moment at a time and you will get there.  Focus on the positives to quitting - the perceived negatives are only temporary and go away with time.

Turn out lights, check oven/stove, windows locked, water for dog, cell phone in purse, etc, about 14 items.   Have to revise my list. No longer need to put lighter and cigarettes in my purse, and be sure I have an orange in my lunch. The orange was for the peel. After I smoked a cigarette on my lunch break, I broke up pieces of orange peel, crushed them in my palms to release the scented oils, and lightly smoothed that over my face, hands, and hair. After that, I chewed on another piece so that my breath would be citrus-y, not blech.

I basically "fooled" myself into thinking I was still getting nicotine. This worked amazingly well and the final withdrawal was almost painless.         Funny you mention this now, Andi, because I just heard something about medical researchers doing more research into the placebo effect and how it can be ethically used with patients.  I seem to recall that the effect occured even when the patient was told that the pill s/he was taking was just a sugar pill.    I like the band aid idea. The body would be conditioned to experiencing the relief of nicotine when a patch was in place. Instead of doing a step down--i.e., from 21 mg to a 14 mg patch--I may go directly to band aid patches. I'll have a talk with myself first to discuss how it could work and I'll be so happy.
Yesterday at 4:20 pm my father died of smoking-related emphysema. He had smoked for more than 50 years. How many years more would he have had with a wife and family he loved?  I have not given up on myself. I have a new job as of several months ago, and it comes with excellent health insurance. I have joined the medical insurance company's preparation for smoking cessation coaching program to help with better plans for quitting and making it stick. The first session was an eye opener. I though I knew all of the strategies for quitting, but I was wrong. It's a Web-based conference call, supposed to be a small group of four of us, but the other three didn't show up. It was nice to have one-on-one conversation about my past efforts and how I can make this time the last time. Three more sessions to go. After that, they offer a staying-quit coaching group, which I also will join.     When I am truly quit and have a month or two successfully lived as a nonsmoker, I'll be back to make daily pledges.  Until then,  may you all be happily living free of addiction and breathing only clean air.
    I'm really sorry about your dad's passing away yesterday Kate  Glad you're working on quitting again.....
    Im sorry Kate, Stay strong! A kiss and hug your way.
    Condolences on the passing of your beloved father Kate! I'm glad to hear you are pursuing every method of creating a successful quit for yourself that you can. This smoking addiction is nasty and I just hate it! It only takes and gives us nothing good in return.      Hope to see you when ever you feel you'd like some support from us here on the Train.
    So sorry to hear Kate. I lost my dad to virtually the same thing almost three years ago and have wanted to quit every since.  I do not want to only be able to live by the length of a hose. What misery that has to be and could it have been prevented? Probably . I also saw what throat cancer did and hope I have the strength to stay strong enough to beat these demons. I have come to want this more than anything and wish for you the same thing! Prayers to you and your family.
    Welcome back to the forum and sorry to hear about your dad 
    I'm sorry to hear about your dad, Kate.     Smoking truly is horrible.  Feel free to reach out to us as you embark on your quit journey. 
    Sorry about your dad.  Condolences.     As you continue with the process of quitting, feel free to take a seat on the Train anytime you like.       Best wishes to you and your family.
    I am so sorry to hear about your father's death.     
    Prayers for strength and peace.
    Kate,   So terribly sorry about the loss of you dad.  I bet this is especially tough during the holidays.       I am glad you have come to realize the health costs of smoking.  You do not have to wait to become a part of the forum.  We would love to follow you on your journey of ridding yourself of this addiction.  There is so much information here and lots of friendship.  We are a great support system.  We have all been through the withdrawal and come out on the other side. Linda

    Kate, I am so very, very sorry for your loss. 
    Sorry to hear about your father.         
    I am really sorry, Kate.

Sending heartfelt condolences to you and your family Kate.      Please quit ASAP.       Each year, over 6 million* other people are experiencing this grief as a result of death from direct tobacco use.       * World Health Organization
My condolences on the passing of your father.       Please do not confuse thinking of and planning for quitting for actually quitting and trying to save your life.  I have seen hundreds (thousands?) of people over the years use lengthy preparation as an unconscious method of avoiding the actual quit.  The time to quit is now, and every cigarette is damaging and potentially killing you.  You have everything you need to be successful right now.          Christian99 Nearing 17 Years Quit

    It is always tough to lose a loved one.  Now it's your turn to prevent that for yourself.  Just quit.  Stop it.  Now.  Making plans to quit means you are not serious about it.  It's like talking about taking a trip or going on a cruise.  It's just talk.  You are not going on the trip or taking a cruise until you go.  Cutting down, using alternative methods or fooling yourself is not quitting.  Like jumping into a cold swimming pool, no matter how long you wait, the water is still cold.   YOu have to confront the demon called nicotine and go to war against him, vowing never to bow to his influences ever again.  We're here to help.  Put them down today and never buy another pack, never borrow another butt.  It's tough for a week, then it gets better.

Be sure and make your NOPE pledge everyday.  It may seem silly but it works.    Sweetie, you can do this!

I have watched most of Joel's videos and Allen Carr's, watched videos about diseases, documentaries about people dying from smoking, have poured through websites and read about harm smoking causes, and engaged socially at the quit smoking forum that dissolved.  I've clocked hundreds of hours trying to force myself to desire to quit.     There is a region of the brain that is supposed to be developed in humans by the time we're in our early twenties.  I'm sure we've all heard about the prefrontal cortex.  I've had problems with other impulses (maybe partly a problem of being bipolar) throughout my life. By working on the skill of impulse control in general, I am hopeful that I can quit smoking.     I don't know what else to do.

When I feel more confident I'll put it back.
@Kate18, you can quit even if you still desire to smoke. I did. I had to! I equated it to the desires I've had throughout my life, like I still want to ride dirt bikes, but know I can't anymore. I still want to jump over people on a pogo stick but know I can't anymore. I looked at it like things that I outgrew and smoking was one of them. I still have days i would like to smoke but know I can't anymore.....  As long as you're ready to quit, you can quit.... I did      Edited December 9, 2018 by jillar
    Hi Kate and welcome to your forever quit!       I hope you can put some of the things you have learned from looking into the impulse control issue to use with this quit. You will have a lot of people here to support you as you move forward so please use this forum as much as you need to. Of course we also have an SOS page that has been very effective for many should you ever need it. There is even a thread on that page called Pre-respond To Your Own SOS. There you can write a meaningful message to yourself about why you should never give in again and you can always go there in an instant to read it should you be having a weak moment. It's a great resource.        It sounds like you really want this quit and you are prepared for it as much as any of us can be so jump right in, pledge NOPE every day and lean on us here for support because that's what we are here for     
    Congratulations on quitting smoking Kate.   The voice of the addict is a complete LIE.  There is NOTHING, physiological or psychological, that forces us to continue an addiction.  There is NOTHING preventing an addict from cleaning up. You always have choice.  Always.    Please choose LIFE. Commit to yourself, your quit and NOPE. That is IT. NOPE-ly yours,  S       You might have some things to add on this threadRed Flags

Think how smoking really does nothing for you.    You can do this!
    Great to see you have quit Kate ....    You can do it ....one day at a time ...take time to read all you can ,and watch the video,s.....    Don't forget our NOPE thread...it's a powerful tool...and will set you up and running every day....
Today was a day off from working, so I have been reading the book by Baumeister and Tierney, "Willpower." They report the many studies of the effects of blood glucose on decision-making ability. I am about 95 % through transitioning to a plant-based diet, influenced by a book entitled "The Engine 2 Diet." My blood labs and blood pressure have me in early heart attack and stroke territory, so I'm make what seems to be the best change in diet.       When I was hungry, I reached for a cigarette. From now on, when I'm wanting to smoke, I'll ask myself if I am just hungry. If I have a piece of fruit for quick glucose, followed by beans and rice or soup pre-made.  If these guys are right, then my ability to resist a craving will be stronger.       I've been afraid of weight gain and used smoking to curb my appetite. I just went on Amazon and ordered three size 12 jeans (I'm usually a 10). I'm preparing for the likely weight gain that can result with quitting smoking when food becomes a substitution.  I hate doing this. I worked so hard to get from 220 down to 145. I've stayed in a normal weight range for 10 years. Quitting smoking is more important, and if it means temporary weight gain, then I'll accept that.         According to this book, keeping a steady blood glucose level greatly enhances decision-making ability and makes a person more successful at beating addiction. Since all the gross pictures, sad stories, daily pledges to stay quit, and info on Joel's site (and other sites) didn't cause a strong enough desire to stay quit, then I'll try something else. I'll approach addiction from a biological/neurological standpoint. I don't feel like such a loser when I read the studies of what the authors call willpower depletion in their subjects.

    Quitting smoking is a journey .....some gain weight some don't .....    Once you have a good solid quit going ...you will find its then you worry about the few pounds you have gained ,and then start to watch your diet....   Its hard to do the two together....quitting the cancer sticks is your first priority.... They are killing you ...a few extra pounds are not the killer....  Be kind to yourself......don't over think...         
    How are you today ? Remember    HALT    check this thread outRiffing On H.A.L.T.         
@Kate18 so sorry for your loss. my dad also had emphysema. you can do this, and this is a great support system. hugs!
After many failed attempts, I quit successfully over 3 years ago by pledging NOPE (just for today) every day until I could just say "not one puff ever". The difference was being educated about all the lies of addiction that could possibly draw me back into smoking and having a response to each one, understanding that my mind was being hijacked by some kind of drug lords. I personally think will power is over rated. For me, it was about education and taking it one day at a time, one hour at a time, sometimes one minute at a time. Do anything except smoke.
    Will power or determination IS required but I agree that education about the addiction is probably the most important thing in terms of not only quitting but also protecting your quit because until you truly believe that smoking offers you nothing positive, you are at risk so .... educate yourselves on this addiction. It really matters!
    So sorry for your loss, Kate.   Something i read or heard somewhere that i found reassuring at the start of my quit was "nothing bad will happen if you don't smoke",  i suppose it's linked to the anxiety of stopping smoking, similar to what you said about your ticker making you panicky. And i think it's true that smoking causes anxiety too.  I really hope you stick with your quit and stay here for support as it is a great place
    Sorry to hear about your father, Kate.  I know what it’s like to lose a parent to smoking related diseases. I lost my mom a couple of years ago. She smoked most of her life.       Others are right. The time is now. Just do it and move on with your life.It’s not that difficult once you get past the first week or so. Then it’s all in your mind. You do indeed have control of your thoughts.       Cigarettes do nothing for you. They take away your time, your money and your health.
Hello - I read through some of the posts about relapsing, but figured to post a new message.        In October, I relapsed with cigarettes. I quit cigarettes in March 2015 after smoking regularly (1 1/2 packs a day) for 19 years. During a very stressful week then (including the synagogue shooting massacre here in Pittsburgh), I bought a pack, and have been smoking since.       It's weird. And idiotic. I can't figure out the triggers. I smoke only at home. I don't think about smoking during work, in the car, working out, socializing. Just at home. And I'm back to the same terrible habit of sneaking outside for a smoke (a few a day), including the wake-up cig, post-work cig, etc.      I'm furious with myself. I worked so hard to get nicotine-free, and find myself smoking really for no reason. I' need help to stop it.      If anyone has any advice or experienced something similar, let me know. (When I prepped for my qui in 2015, I was on quitsmokingmessageboard.com, and found invaluable support there. That website seems to be gone now.)        Edited December 3, 2018 by Sparky
    Hi Sparky - yes, QSMB is gone! I was a member there and managed to educate myself about my addiction and keep my quit solid while there....once that site was no more, I came here along with several others and it is has been so helpful in maintaining my quit (also a lot of laughs along the way!).        There are always going to be life events that are stressful, depressing, etc. but why feel you have to go back to smoking to get past them? I am sure that first cigarette you smoked after a couple of years smoke free was awful, wasn't it? What did it do for you? Watch some of Joel's videos, read through members blogs and posts and start NOPING every day! You have done it before, you can do it again!       
    Sparky, welcome aboard for this journey.  Others will come by soon that will have good advice on relapsing.  I would suggest that you look thru all the educational material here on the sight and I am sure there is a video on this in the video library.  Education is all powerful.  You must understand that smoking does not solve anything and can only make things work.  Please go through all this is on this site.  We will be here to support you and hopefully answer questions you might have.  Also QSMB is no longer any several of the members of that site are now here on this site -- you may recognize the names as they come up.  Anyway when you are ready to quit again we are here to support!!!
    Hi sparky, welcome to quittrain. You will find the same support here as you did at qsmb. Stay glued here as much as possible for that first year or longer and read anything and everything as it pertains to your quit. Let's get this done  
    Welcome to the board, Sparky.  I'm really sorry to hear about your relapse.  I hope you see that life is better without cigarettes and that you are going to quit again.  It is true what is said here (and at QSMB), take NOPE seriously.  You can never take another puff.  It will awaken the addiction again and you never want to do that.     Stick around here.  Read and participate often.  It can help you stay quit for good.  I came from QSMB too and I can tell you that there are a lot of good folks here who want to see you succeed at quitting as well.
The reason that you are smoking is that you are addicted. All of my failed quit attempts were ultimately down to a lack of education about what it means to be addicted, all the lies that the nicotine addiction feeds you and strategies for getting through the first year. After that it is just a matter on doing the same thing over and over again. I am back posting after more than 3 years because I am having these weird occasional thoughts of 'having just one'... This is the biggest lie of nicotine addiction. But I am sure it will pass, it always does. These urges to smoke always go away and can remain thankfully dormant for a long long time but one has always to be prepared for them to rise again.
Thanks everyone (and I do recognize some of you from QSMB, like johnny5 - at least your pic!). I'll be on here, and I'm so, so glad I found this forum.         I'm going to plan on a new quit day. I need to re-educate myself on the dormancy of addiction. I know the couple of times since summer when I had that "one" after 3 1/2 years, thinking it's just the "one." And I tricked myself into thinking that it wouldn't do anything in the near future.       I think of all the great things I accomplished post-quitting (bought my first house, found and started a great new job), and how do I get back to that power without cigarettes?
    Smoking gives you nothing Sparky - only takes away from the best things in your life including life itself in the end.  Jump on the train and ride your way to freedom again! We will be here for support but it's up to you ultimately to make it happen.  You can do this!
    You did it before and you can do it again Sparky. You have not failed as long as you keep honestly trying in your heart. Pick a date and get back here. Good people and lots of support. Best wishes.
After about 20 failed attempts to quit smoking I finally succeeded on the qsmb in 2015 by educating myself about all the lies that i believed about nicotine and my smoking. It worked and i am not a smoker to this day.       Unfortunately a few months after I quit I was diagnosed with lung cancer. I am still here though but would have been glad to have missed that experience in my early 50s after 35 years of smoking.     There are also lots of people on this forum who are suffering from smoking related diseases. I quit too late to avoid one of the worst. Be someone who quits early enough to miss the bad outcomes.
    Sparky,     As you can see I am very early into my quit, a month and a day. All I can say is that the people on this site care. I had quit once before but this time is totally different. I want it...like I have never wanted anything. I realize I could fail but I'm not worried about it right now. Is it easy nope but it is easier. I hate cigarettes...the smell , the stigma everything about them. My wife still smokes, and that is something that weighs heavy on my mind. Most people asks if that makes it harder. I can honestly say no now.         I'm not the one that smells like smoke and trying to find a warm place to blow one when we go somewhere. There is no smoking when we are traveling unless we stop and she can get out of the truck. I am not one of those holy rollers...yet... but cannot ...do not... want to be around it. I wish she would at least try again , but she must not be ready. But that aside , listen to these folks because they are the best, and genuinely care. I will stay quit, I feel it this time and hope that you get that same feeling back.        Good luck and like they say..NOPE!
    Welcome aboard Sparky.  I don't have much to add as you have already received great advice in this thread.      However, I will say just a couple of quick things.  Smokers relapse because we are addicts who conditioned ourselves with cigarettes for years.  Any other "reason" to smoke is merely an excuse.  As has already been mentioned, education is vital to building a solid quit.  Understand your addiction and shed light on the lies we all told ourselves as smokers.      A relapse is not something that just happens.  It is a choice.  There is only one choice to make in building a quit: do I smoke or not?  Choose wisely and you will be free from cigarettes for good.       Buckle up, knuckle down, and drive on.

    Welcome aboard Sparky...    Sorry to hear you you smoked ....once a addict always a addict...   There is alot of information here to help you quit again.....Watch all joels Video,s....    Smoking doesn't change ,solve,fix ,anything ....    Take smoking Off the Table ...you can do it ....you Will receive all the support you need here....  Looking forward to getting to know you better ...
    Right... first, don't be an idiot like me and wait well over a decade to quit again. Strike now... because the longer you leave it the harder it is.        One day at time. You only have to quit for a day. That's not too hard, just one day.         
    Hi Sparky.  Welcome aboard again.  I am in the early stages of quitting but find it helps when I can help and encourage others.  That was a terrible incident in Pittsburgh that took lives.  Why let that sick person take any more lives, including yours.  You did this before and can do it again.      Get your new quit going and we will be right there with you.  
    Hello Sparky,   You will have a successful quit when you understand your nicotine addiction and commit to Not One Puff EVER.    Relapse is a choice, a dangerous and regrettable choice.    Better to choose Life and Freedom.  I am glad you are here. S    
    Quit now!  Jump!  
OK... so I remembered what I wanted to say... so that 3 1/2 year quit you had... that's gone now... don't dwell on it... you need to move forward... this is your new quit... its a new day, a new beginning, you move forward always, don't even bother looking back on what you had... remember the lessons you learnt but don't dwell in the past...
G’day Sparkey   I have a 3 year quit. I front up every morning and make that simple acknowledgement. Not One Puff Ever. NOPE.   I started on the QSMB just before going to wedding and worrying about relasping with old friends and all. That was feb 2016, missed an occasional day since then.   Well every days diferent. Births and weddings, deaths, parties, Xmas, cancer, birthdays, which job will I take? New truck, and they are just some of the more exciting.     I personally like the normal ones, fully of perfectly uneventful stuff.... still    they start with a NOPE. I invite you to start fronting up and taking the NOPE pledge. It’s corny it’s public.   Confessing to being an Addict that will never be able to take another puff, might be daughting. But it’s truely painless and quick and you get to spend the rest of your day enjoying heaps of other shit that doesnt involve smoking!  Chris
    Thanks everyone for the support and for sharing your experiences!       The last time I bought a pack, the other day, another customer in line at the convenience store looked me up and down when I ordered a pack and asked me "Why are YOU a smoker??" A complete stranger. I told him, "Because I'm an idiot." I do believe it's one of many, many signs recently that I need to regain control, make a choice, and stop.       This is ending.

    Looking forward to seeing your new quit date. May I suggest getting yourself a ticker for your signature so you can watch all the time, money and cigarettes not smoked add up? I loved watching mine

    G’day Sparky    Good! ..... catch you tomorrow  C
    Nobody can help you but you.    When you want to quit, you will quit.   When you don't want to quit, you will continue to fart around.  Only you can choose one way or the other.   Don't look to us.   We can't do it for you.     ezpz

(I know some disagree with picking a specific date/time)              You're doing this the right way; picking a date the following day.  Some pick a date after the holidays, after this or that and it's just not necessary.  It's like telling a {pick your drug} addict to keep on using until they're more comfortable to stop using.  Either way, today is the day.  BTW, I had my last cigarette at 7pm the day I quit.     You should start a blog today to chronicle your quit.  Use it as a journal of sorts because it's another way of keeping yourself accountable to stay nicotine free.  The other way of course is one that you've already done; telling the world that you're quitting this evening at 8pm.  Trust me, we'll be watching.
    You can do it !!!!  Once you have made the decision never to ..Never put any thing in your mouth and set fire to it ....youv,e quit.......

    I'm done. Lighter drowned, butts outside in the trash on the curb.   
    Well done Sparky.  You should go to the Daily NOPE section and vow not to smoke today with the simple word "NOPE".
    That's great news, Sparky.  This is your first step to a much better life.      Try to focus on the positive.  You are doing a great thing.
    You got this sparky!

    Great News, Sparky! We are here for you. I am terribly sorry for the stress you endured, please remember, you are not alone.

Still do a bit. This feeling that I'm denying myself some sense of pleasure.
    That feeling is pretty standard Sparky yet I know it's hard to shake. Try to focus on the big picture though .... improved health - improved wealth and freedom from enslavement to nicotine addiction! Those are all huge benefits. It's even harder during the holiday season because we all want to "feel good" and smoking was part of our feel good process when we smoked. Truth is, not smoking can make us feel a lot better about things. No more running outside for a smoke in the cold and missing time with family & friends or worrying about if we have enough smokes to tide us over while the stores are closed at Christmas           Giving the finger to smoking during the holidays can feel REAL GOOD!
    Sparky, great that you stopped smoking.  You mentioned you felt like you were denying yourself some sense of pleasure -- look at that thought as rubbish.  You are giving yourself more pleasure as the benefits of not smoking will begin to add up -- you are giving yourself a new sense of freedom, enjoy it!!!!
    Hello. Just an update. I am doing really well enjoying the approaching holidays as a non-smoker there are so many benefits that I lose count of all the good things about not smoking. I come here every day and read sometimes a little sometimes a lot. And there are so many that I say that's me! Or sometimes I say hey that used to be me!    Like everyone else I have good days and bad days but I continually have more better days than bad days. Sometimes I forget to reward myself and when I do it feels really great! I wish I was better at commenting, because the comments of so many of you have gotten me through some tough spots. I know sometimes people disappear and we wonder what happened to them and you all have been so good to me I just wanted to stop in and let you know I'm doing well actually I'm doing great! Thank you for all you do
    I am so happy to hear from you, Parsley.    All your comments are very appreciated.     It is great that you are having more better days than rugged ones.  The good days will get longer and better.   To be honest, the first year can be full of surprise triggers.  Some are seasonal, some are just the remnants of your brain receptors that didn't get the memo yet, YOU QUIT SMOKING !      Please continue building your beautiful quit and do reward yourself.    Thanks for checking in, we do worry and wonder. Hope you have wonderful holidays, Parsley.  S
    Parsley, so glad you are doing so well.  We understand you are enjoying life as a non smoker!  Keep checking in and keeping us up on you journey.  It helps us to know that lives can be changed.   Linda
Thanks for sticking around Parsley and letting us know you're doing well. That IS important to us here because I think we tend to take on other people's quits like they are our own and you're right, it is a little concerning when people just disappear and we don't know if they are OK or not. I know most just move on with life but still, we wonder.       And please don't feel your comments are inadequate or not important for others to hear. I think we all feel that way and we don't realize that the simple words any of us may have to offer on any given day might just register with someone we don't even know who is thinking about quitting or trying to quit. Every single contribution here could be a live-savor to someone  Edited December 7, 2018 by reciprocity
    Thanks so much for your words Parsley.  Your quit seems to going good now.  Never be afraid to add your comments.  Your simple but effective way of documenting your quit can and will help so many people, they will see that though there are difficult times you can quit this habit and reap many rewards !!!!
    Great to hear from you Parsley....and great to hear you are doing well with your fabulous quit ...x
    Great to see your traveling so well. Never think sharing your story or offering your opinion is not important because often it is the simple little things you say that are the spark that lights someone else's fire to quit... or it is the comment that changes someones life...
    Thanks for the update parsley, glad you're doing so well 
When I tried quitting before, I was always just abstaining, trying to find something to make me not want to smoke. that's what I was trying to buy each time, something to change my mind for me and squash my desire. but nothing did, because we all know, nothing does, that comes from within yourself. anyway, I digress, in my failed quits, I was always bargaining with myself, for example, I'll quit, but allow myself one or two cigarettes a day as a reward, I calculated that I was only then smoking between 2.5 and 5% of my pre quit amount, and therefore I was very good, and should not feel bad, but feel triumphant instead. another deal, was the I'll smoke other peoples cigarettes, therefore I was no longer wasting money. I switched to roll your own cigarettes, therefore my habit was costing less, again, no guilt, but pride at how clever and economic I was. then I started putting filter tips in the roll your own cigarettes, so that they were healthier, again wasn't I good! I was always making stupid deals with myself about my smoking to try to justify my continued useage. This mindset often creeps into the freshly quit newbie.  and it can be devastating and undermining to your best laid plans. try to recognise this bargaining, and address it, either personally, or by discussing it.  but do it before the chatter becomes overwhelming.
I wish, like you, I had of understood this last year. When I tried to quit in July and then October, every time ending up with a different smoking criteria. The pats on the back for going a day, or having 10 a day, or  whatever were crazy - I was smoking! I shake my head now, if I just had of held on and trusted that the world would not have this many reformed smokers if this were impossible.  Great message Jonny, thanks and re-inforces my thought process which is handy as that's where I am in this quit now.

Great post Jonny, you actually had me laughing at my own actions as a smoker!  I used to feel that I was being so much healthier and saving money by rolling my own and using a filter!  It's just insane! I remember when they started including another chemical in cigarettes to help with the fire hazard when dropped etc...and how outraged I was at the idea that they were doing that!  It's like they didn't care about my health at all.  :wacko2: that additional chemical was a  game changer for sure!
Oh the bargaining.....I think smokers make great lawyers. Haha.  I remember,  whatever the bargain was....the cigarette was always my reward.  Crazy
Oh I remember searching the garage floor for dockers....well it wasn't a real full cig was it?, didn't count....oh the things I would do and tell myself ;)

Oh I remember searching the garage floor for dockers....well it wasn't a real full cig was it?, didn't count....oh the things I would do and tell myself ;) It's funny looking back, as a teen, I would look for cigarette butts, and roll out the remaining tobacco into a little tin to make "butt rollies" as we would call them.  it's pretty disgusting really lol, and nothing like the James Dean persona that my midseye was creating for me!!  how I couldn't see that I was a hopeless nicotine junkie... I was going to say I don't know!... but I do, we all do. I'm so glad to have moved on from that episode of my life.
I carried on with the bargains....when facing a big trigger I used to promise my junky that we could smoke AFTER the event. Of course, by then I didn't want to...but the deal helped me through a few craves!

Exactly that. I'm not the sharpest tool, but my junkie is always so desperate for a deal, that he falls for the same trick every time.... You sell yourself short my friend. each of us has a different smoking conundrum to solve, it's all pretty much the same physiologically, and the recovery clock ticks the same etc, but it's the crazy justifications that we created that we have to unravel for ourselves.  sometimes I find that examples, and analogies can flick a switch for someone, but the personal riddle is yours to solve alone.... and you have found your riddle key :-) you are playing your junkie at his own game :-) very sharp if you ask me :-)
    bump        and here is a list of Red Flags,    more voices of our addict.  Stay vigilant, y'all.
    Hey all     Just wanted to get thoughts and opinions on why we relapse after years sometimes. 
It's an addiction Kdad, plain & simple and we are all nicotine addicts.     Weak moment years down the road - too much to drink at a social gathering & someone offers a smoke and you momentarily think; "I beat this smoking thing for years. I can have one .... it won't hurt". You have one or even a few drags and it awakens your junkie brain. A day or two later you buy a pack thinking you can just have another one. Surely you could smoke just one a day and not 20 or 30 like you used to. Within a week you're back up to a pack a day and the regret over what you did is crushing.        It's really easy to maintain your quit once you have a full year or more under your belt but you must always guard against doing something foolish on a whim. People don't smoke years after they quit because they have some overwhelming urge to smoke again. It's always something that starts out very innocently but ends up badly. The circumstances vary but the story is always the same ..... I thought I could have just one!
    Good question, and not really someone qualified to answer, still way too young in my quit.      However I think (and this is based on a recent super intense crave episode) the starting point of the relapse is what is crucial to identify. We long for familiarity in unfamiliar or stressful situations, and in such cases, whether months or years after your quit, the brain automatically rewinds to the "familiar" which was lighting up. Regardless of whether that helped or not, it was just the next "natural" thing to do. So maybe that pattern is sometimes hidden for years and suddenly comes to the fore. It's like the brain trying to comfort itself by saying, the last time you did this action, and were able to get through, so let's rinse and repeat, in a manner of speaking.        The fact is the last time and each time, the only way out is through, so one has to deal with situations. Having a cigarette in my hand won't change the dynamics of the problem, but yes that's the fight we gotta win each time.
    I have never had a long quit...this is the longest.... I only did odd days,odd week here and there...   As its been said ..It's a Addiction...and we must always be on our guard...not to let junkie thinking in ....   We get complacent.... We think one wont hurt.....we think it's only one,I won't get hooked...   It only takes that one ..to wake the monster....
Its a great question... especially for newbies if they see people further along quit. So I threw away a long quit, I didn't loose it, I chose to toss it away but having a smoke, buying a pack and being a junky. I can tell you this quit, the one I have now, will be the last quit I have... and it feels completely different to the first one. This quit is basically a done deal now, I know I can never have another puff because I know 1 puff and I'm a pack a day within a week. But this time I don't even want one.        So the first time I quit was for over 6 years. That said I felt the same at 6 years as I did at 3 weeks... I never got beyond that... I only kept the quit as long as I did because I couldn't find a "good enough" (in my twisted brain) reason (excuse) to justify to myself and others why I smoked.... eventually I found one.... it was pathetic but it was the first 'decent' thing I found. You see I only quit because someone else said I couldn't... I didn't want to quit, I just wanted to prove them wrong... the whole time I didn't smoke I romanced the cigarette... I sought out people who smoked and hung with them so I could second hand smoke.... every day I wanted one... I just had to find a reason where (in my mind) I wouldn't look too bad if I smoked. So I had one after a car accident... then bought a pack... then bought another pack... and continued to do that for more than a decade... and then I have this quit... I hardly ever think about smoking anymore and when I do I get a feeling of revulsion.... this is my sticky quit... completely different mind set.
    Being comfortable enough to believe that they can outsmart the Law of Addiction...you can't. One=all.       NOPE. 
    Prior to this quit, I only refrained from smoking when pregnant, fully intending to smoke again asap.       This quit feels rock solid but, I know that I can throw it away with one puff.  I think the realization that I am an addict and the education about nicotine addiction that is refreshed consistently   helps to solidify my quit.  Also, the horrifying thought of re-living another quit quells any junkie thought that might creep in.   I never ever want to go through that again.     Being an addict is a curious thing. It never goes away and is instantly awakened with ONE puff. This is why vigilance is fundamental.        
    G'day   And did you know that first cig tastes like crap. Doesn't give you that lift or anything that you remember. Still you go back to smoking though.    Well, I'm awake to that now. I'm not forgetting and get myself robbed again.    NOT ONE PUFF EVER   C
    We are all addicts.  The longer you go without smoking, the more dormant the addiction becomes.         I rarely think about smoking now but the occasional thought does still hit me.  It is weak but it is still there.       Recognizing that you will always be an addict and that you can never take another puff is the key.  You will get to the point where you rarely think about smoking anymore and aren't tempted by it.        Some people at this stage, I think, believe they have the addiction beat and think "just one won't hurt."  They let their guard down completely and decide to light up.  Horrible mistake.  That re-ignites the addiction.      The key is to stick to NOPE - not one puff ever.  That is the only way you beat the addiction.
    Don't include all of us in your "we". The Sarge will NEVER relapse.     Those who relapse, do so for one and only one reason : they smoked tobacco.         EZPZ
    We are all addicts and as such we are all one puff away from a pack a day.
    Once you internalize that smoking has no benefit - and learn that one puff will start the active addiction again - then you will have your stickey quit.        As human beings, we do not want to do things that will not have a benefit for us.       So once you internalize that smoking has no benefit, you simply will not want to do it.         It is exactly for these same reasons, that most people who have never smoked, never start.          Cristóbal            
    SMOKING IS A ADDICTION..... It's not a habit..!!!!!......once my brain totally understood this ....I settled down in this quit...   I thought I was a lady...yes some of you... Lady lol......who just had a ciggy habit ....no i was a junkie......    So ...like any other addiction...there is no such thing as ..Just One !!!!
those that relapse were still convinced somewhere in their brain that smoking actually did something for them.  Even if they stayed abstinent for 10 years.         those of us who KNOW it does absolutely nothing for us....we will never relapse.  Ever.
ahhh we think "oh one will not kill me" but yes as addicts, it is not going to be just one! And even that one makes you a smoker. Point blank.. We can do this when stressed, drunk haha, etc. When my stepson passed I lit up the same night. I said it will just be to make it through the next few days..yeah OK! I smoked almost another 3 years. Never again. NOPE!
    Great thoughts everyone! The habit vs addiction distinction has to be made to make a quit last. I think a part of the addiction is a need and satisfaction cycle.  It's a cycle independent of nicotine per say, which is why substituting hard candy for instance works. You want something - you satisfy that want. This dynamic is at the forefront and you could say that indeed smoking "does" provide something, the completion of the cycle of want. The trick seems to be A - finding other things to want or B - realizing that you don't need anything. Not at all saying I have this figured out, just some thoughts.        Ken

My dad smoked over 40 years. Had 5 by-pass surgery, half his voice box removed, COPD, and had quit for 26 years. We had just got done eating a great breakfast...pancakes , eggs, bacon , and a great cup of coffee. I watched him push himself away from the table and reach for his pocket. I couldn't believe it. I said really? He said you don't understand I could smoke one so easy right now it would make your head spin , but it  will pass very quick. That is how strong this is. He died because of smoking and I still crave it on a daily basis. I feel guilty for how I feel and think how can you quit and crave it after 26 years? I know it will take time but pray every day I can withstand the temptation. This sucks! How can something like this control your life? I have quit what I thought were a lot worse habits as a youngster and realize now just what kind of grip these nasty things have on me. I hate it!
@Wantsit, this addiction is a monster no doubt about it. The good thing about the craves farther down the road is that they are just brief thoughts that are easily dismissed. I still have them from time to time and figure I probably always will. But they are gone as quickly as they come.    You are doing great and I promise you these bad days will become fewer and farther apart the longer you are quit 
Thank you jillar. I hope so because up until now I've done really well. We buried a friend of mine today...62 years old because of lung cancer. Have to stay strong!
    I'm sorry about the loss of your friend @Wantsit, and yes stay strong because it will be so worth it. 
    Yes, sorry about your friend Wantsit. That and other horrible health issues is what smoking has in store for us almost surely if we continue to light up. Quitting is our best option! And Jillar is absolutely correct in what she said. Yes, there are still thoughts of smoking that come to us from time to time but they are no longer what I would call cravings. They are very easy to dismiss. The key is you have to truly believe that smoking did nothing positive for you; only harm. If that is your true mindset, dismissing these thoughts about smoking is very easy - virtually no effort. Not like the early days of your quit that's for sure.       Stay with it. You too will be fine  
    You guys are the bomb!! Thank you for all your positive thoughts!
I have been quit for 14'ish months. I smoked for 15 years. It is still several times a week I get a brief crave for a smoke.    For your own situation -  It looks like you are on your third week. Just use that as encouragement when needed and think, "I survived three weeks without a smoke, no need to ruin it now". You have made it through the wort days which is the first week. Battles will come and go but you already proved you can do it.      Some people here need this forum to maintain their quit in the beginning. Yeah there is a lot of fun stuff, joking around, whatever. The sad parts though is hearing about omeone's death from smoking. I doubt anyone picked up their first cigarette and thought, "This could eventually kill me, this will cost me, it will make me stink, make me a slave, etc".    Cigarettes are evil little bastards.        What made me finally want to quit more than i wanted to smoke - I finally realized what assholes cigarettes are. I came to hate them.   What helps me keep my quit NOW is this - I do not want to go back to the slavery of being a smoker. I prefer to live on MY terms. Even if parts of my lifestyle pisses off the Trump supporters. Wait, wrong forum...   But to be honest, yes there are times I really want one. Cannot do it though.       So then,  what is YOUR reason to never go back to smoking?

I hate it!               Hello Wansit,      Congratulations on completed Week # 3 !!!       Your Dad still wanted to smoke because even after 26 years of not smoking, he did not have enough education to eliminate the lies the addiction had created in his head, telling him there were benefits of smoking. As long as you believe there are benefits of smoking, you will not have a happy quit and you will feel like you are depriving yourself.        So how do you go from the Point A of being a smoker, to the Point B of being a happy non-smoker who has internalized that there are no benefits of smoking ???      It is done through education about nicotine addiction, and how it affected you physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.          Quitting smoking involves stopping smoking, but that is not all of it if you want to have a stable and happy quit.      Invest time in yourself and your quit, and educate yourself as much as you can:     Check out  http://www.whyquit.com       Watch Joel Spitzer´s videos here on QuitTrain https://www.quittrain.com/forum/15-joel-spitzers-quit-smoking-video-library/      And spend some time every day on this forum, asking questions as you did right now.     All of this will help you put your mind and body where it needs to be - with a strong educated quit, ready to live life again as it should be lived: in complete freedom of all that you are as a human being, from addiction.          CristóbalEdited November 24, 2018 by Cristóbal

And it is different in many ways from my first quit, I agree. I need to be inspired as you are and make this quit IT.             Welcome Sparky. So the single biggest piece of advice I got early on was only take it one day at a time. I kid you not for the first four month I just quit for the day. I didn't worry about tomorrow, or next week, or next month I just worried about one day, 24 hours... that's it. After the first day I knew I could do 24 hours... and this time, I armed myself with knowledge. I watched the videos and read the articles and watched the documentaries. Many here have had success with Alan Carr... there are those who have cold turkied and those who have used NRT. I just hit my 1 year. I feel so different to the first, big quit. I am more solid at a hair past 1 year than I was at 6 years last time. Seriously though I still tell myself every morning... I'm not going to smoke today.
Hi all, I just like to post randomly here because you all are a huge part of my success and I do not want that to be forgotten!   I was out this weekend for my birthday and so many smokers were around, I did not realize so many people still smoked, or maybe it was just social smoking as we were at a bar! I was drinking and the thought of smoking did pass my mind, I cannot lie...but it lasted for about 3 minutes and I did not give in!! I am proud. I knew I would hate myself.How is everyone doing and coping with the Holiday season?????
    Good stuff Christa! That exact situation has brought down many and unprotected quit and as you said, it gives nothing but regret in the end. Good for you that you recognized the situation and continued to just NOPE! That's the only way we can stay free forever - NOPE every day and never get complacent  It's so much easier to say no when you're this far along in your quit. Keep up the great work  
    Hi Christa, good to see you  And good job keeping that awesome quit of yours! Have a happy holiday season 
    Hello Christa ! I am so happy to hear you are protecting your precious quit !   Stay vigilant and Stay Free !
    Hi Christa, I can't believe there is smoking inside bars in N.Y.    You can not smoke inside restaurants, stores or public buildings in Ohio.   It is great you are breezing along through your quit.   Have a wonderful holiday season.    Linda

    Okay- it seems to have been a long time but here it is. Damn I feel good today !! First day without an overwhelming crave even for a minuet. I know it's not over but it felt GREAT for one day! I still have a few hours before sleep but have enjoyed it SO much so far. I just want it to continue. A person shouldn't have to want to feel this way. I just want to be able to say NOPE the rest of my days.        Have a great night everyone!
    Great, I love this Wantsit you are starting to see the benefits.  You are right it is not over yet but it is going to get better and it is going to get somewhat easier.  Good for you -- sleep good tonight!!!
Great stuff Wantsit! Like M5 says, you're just starting to see the real benefits of quitting and although you still have work to do, this gives you a taste of what everyday will be like pretty soon. The further you separate yourself from this addiction, the better and easier it will get. Enjoy the feeling
    Love this wantsit, I'm so happy for you. That very first day when you feel great is so awesome and shows you all your hard work is paying off  Have a great night and I hope your tomorrows are just as good 
    You are doing great, Wantsit.  You will still have ups and downs at this stage but it will slowly become a whole lot better.  I am glad you are starting to see the benefits to quitting.       Keep up the great work!
    Such a good thing to read Wantsit, you're doing great, and your enthusiasm is infectious.   KTQ!!!

    A big thank you to everyone!! I realize I have a much longer road ahead of me but I just want everyone to know that you all make it much easier. I look forward to just popping in here if only for a minuet each day. You have helped me make my life better by you knowing the feel of this! I have a high stress job so it would be easy to blame a relapse on that, but just the encouragement here along with the challenges to stay quit makes it different this time. Thank you!
    Just be sure to keep that positive attitude and that lovely quit Wantsit! We're here when you need us

Where does the temptation come from? Crap I haven't  had an issue for a week and all the sudden today I would have sold my soul for 5 minutes of pure smoking pleasure. I haven't an urge this strong since the first 3-4 days. I made it through but I can't explain how or where it came from  and it lasted almost all day. Ready for this business to stop!
You're in WTF week wantsit and now you know why we call it that. There's something about the 3's, 3 days, weeks, months, that get most of us. Just power through like you did today because it will get better
Going thru the nearly 3 month mark myself...one of the infamous 3's. Dig your heels in! Come here, take a shower, have a snack etc etc...just dont smoke! It will pass!
    Yes, wantsit, you are in the WTF week.  The craves come on strong and out of nowhere.  I kind of think it comes from the triggers that you were not fully aware of coming on, also your mind trying to become accustomed to no nicotine.  You can make it thru the week and things will start to look much better as you learn to deal with a nicotine free mind and body!!!!
It get's tiring at times early on but when it does, just go back to the basics. Breathing exercises to calm yourself. Hard candies or whatever your go-to pacifier is and remember .... why you wanted to quit! That's key! Would you really want to go back to nicotine slavery? I think not  Just do one day at a time for now. Still early days. You will get there if you do that.Edited November 20, 2018 by reciprocity
    Thanks all...I thought I was doing good but look at me...being a weakling and wasn't ready for this. Deep breaths. 
Hello Wantsit,  You are not a weakling, you are a hero to yourself, you quit smoking !      Each crave you beat is another receptor in your brain that you own again, another receptor wrenched away from nicotine addiction.       Here is something from The Mayo Clinic you may find interesting     "When you smoke, your brain changes in response to the very high levels of nicotine delivered by cigarettes.    Those brain changes cause you to become addicted to nicotine, and that addiction can make stopping smoking very difficult.  Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine that gets into your body through cigarettes activates structures normally present in your brain called receptors.  When these receptors are activated, they release a brain chemical called dopamine, which makes you feel good.       This pleasure response to dopamine is a big part of the nicotine addiction process. Over time, as you continue to smoke, the number of nicotine receptors in your brain increases.Addicted smokers have billions more of these receptors than nonsmokers do.    When you try to stop smoking, the receptors in your brain do not receive nicotine, so the pleasure response is cut off. In addition, low levels of nicotine lead to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal,    such as strong cravings for a cigarette, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger and difficulty sleeping.   The fastest way to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms is to smoke a cigarette, which releases dopamine and activates the pleasure response.      To make stopping smoking even more difficult, the brain receptors can be conditioned to expect nicotine in certain situations long after you have stopped smoking.  For example, if you regularly smoke when you drink alcohol, or when you are in a stressful situation, or after a meal,  the nicotine receptors in your brain anticipate the dopamine rush from nicotine at that time.   These "trigger" situations can cause intense cravings for a cigarette, even if you have stopped smoking for several months.The good news is that once you stop smoking entirely, the number of nicotine receptors in your brain will eventually return to normal. As that happens, the craving response will occur less often, won't last as long or be as intense and, in time, will fade away completely. — Richard D. Hurt, M.D., Nicotine Dependence Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.          To be fair, our brains have to completely re-fit each receptor and this takes time. Even at five years quit, sometimes a rogue receptor will rear it's ugly head    but, it is easily dismissed.    Replace each smokey thought with something you choose.  Claim back each receptor.   Soon, they will behave and distribute your rewards suitably.    You can help them by rewarding yourself with a little something every time you beat a crave.        Stay focused, you are building a beautiful quit and amassing strength every day.    Nope-ly yours,  SEdited November 20, 2018 by Sazeracrogue for rouge. lol.

    Hoping today is a lot better for you 
@Wantsit Please continue to educate yourself on nicotine addiction...it has changed the chemisty of your brain. Sazerac gave good info above...there are scientific/medical reasons you are feeling like you are. Knowledge of the addiction takes away its power.  YOU are in control of you mind, not nicotine and you need to let junkie brain know that. Don't give smoky thoughts one ounce of romance because it can easily be manipulated and trigger the rest of your receptors to activate in desperation (think of a nursery and one baby starts crying...they ALL start crying)  Give a firm "NOPE! I'm a non-smoker!" Eat a small snack and move on to redirect brain activity.

    Thank you all. I wasn't prepared for the want yesterday, if you can call it that. I appreciate all the feed back. Today will be better.
    Tough times never last, but tough people do.
    Every battle you win...takes you nearer to winning your war ....well done ...
    I think the lesson here is to stay on point and prepared for possible triggers,  especially during the first year.      They really are sometimes shocking in their ferocity    but, they are just receptors in your brain that haven't read the New Rules,  yet.   NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE     
    You did good coming here to voice your concerns Wantsit. Keep doing that when something takes you by surprise because, almost for sure someone here will have experienced the same thing and can tell you what worked for them  
Endure it. When i was 3 months in i bought a pack and on my way home i passed by my brother´s house who is a bad mofo as he made a chest movement and said "endure it like a man". I will never forget the look in his eyes. The thing is, if you believe you will quit smoking without some disconfort and pain, well....i guess it could happen but it is unlikely. Grind your teeth and say nope. Nope through that motherfucker nicodemon. Im with you lad. Lets make it to one month, then ill make you a big celebration page in the cheers section. cmon!
    LOL!! Stewie. Thank you and you have a deal on the celebration! 
    When it comes to breaking an addiction like smoking, the shortest path is through the mud.      You're gonna be a mess before you're through, but when you're through you'll be pristine.
If at only 18 days into your quit you hadn't had an issue for the past week until these recent craves hit, you are waaaayyyy ahead of where I was at that time (hell, you're ahead of where I was 6 months later).   Start the celebration now and give yourself a toast for being the toughest quitter on the block.   Enjoy any good days (or hours or minutes) that you have very early on and grind your way through the bad ones, keeping the end game in sight when things are rough.  You really are doing beautifully, Wantsit, and now you've gotsit!

Hi Everyone,        I'm new to the site, but not new to quitting!       My quit date was 25/11/18 so my last fag was Sunday, well until 30 minutes ago. I have attempted to quit so many times before I have actually lost count. Each of my quits vary from 1 week to 12  months. Each break in quitting always comes back to handling stress or anxiety.      This quit is based on the east way and Jason Vales app. I have found this week really quite easy, one of the easiest yet. But today I have been faced with a stressful task a t work where I can't see a solution to a problem, so I have really craved. I used the SOS videos, went for a walk, did some deep breathing had something to eat and drink but still gave up and went to the shop. Now I have 20 fags (well 19 now) which I don't want but I know I will end up smoking!       I keep coming back to both of the above methods and their comments that we don't start smoking because we think it will help us with stress...BUT I did. When I was 12 years old (now 26), both my parents were very heavy smokers when I was growing up (one still is) and they always use to say 'I'm stressed I need a fag' so when I was 12 and in a state (of what I thought then to be) of stress I thought that the only was that I could get through it was to smoke and I genuinely thought (and still do, to some degree) that it stopped my stress.      So now  each time I am in a stressful situation I just don't seem to be able to get a handle on my emotions and smoke! Does anyone have any advice, please!?        Thank you and sorry for the long post!
Welcome to the board.  You have to accept and acknowledge that smoking does not relieve or cure stress.  What it does is relieve the withdrawal symptoms which makes you feel calmer for 30 minutes or so until the withdrawal symptoms come back.  You have to decide for yourself that there is no circumstance that it is okay to smoke.  NONE!  You are romancing the cigarettes and giving them power they do not have.   Quitting can be uncomfortable, even miserable some times,  but it will not kill you.  Smoking does not do one positive thing for anyone.
My dear Mrs Fowkes,     Initially, what you are getting are more cravings, your body sending signs saying "Oh no, all the nicotine is out of the system, how will we survive?" these red flags make you believe that you cannot operate without smoking.    Trust me, this time, your body is lying to you. You were not born with a smoke in your mouth, you've lived a decently large part of your life not smoking and the same holds true for the rest of it as well.       You have to work towards moving from one crave to the next initially, so the next time you do get a crave, just give yourself 4 minutes. If at the end of 4 minutes, you still feel like smoking, well, give yourself another 4.        in this interim, watch a funny video, read a small article, watch a favourite scene from a movie you love, listen to a great song, maybe twice, dance like no one's watching (that is if no one really is, unless you can dance, I have to lock myself in a room with 6 metres of aluminium before I can do my version of what's called a dance).   But just get through that crave, and very soon, the craves will lessen.     Everyone you meet on the train will vouch for that. The craves will lessen.     Soon you will see how it's better not to be bound by this habit, and not be a slave to it's whims and fancies.      Just take it and deal with it one crave at a time.      There's some really good advice Nancy gave, and many more seasoned quitters will certainly provide you with a lot of gems. Stay close to the forums, drink up on the knowledge, and pretty soon, we'll be celebrating your first month being quit.  Stay strong Mrs Fowkes, you're better than your habit, you're stronger than your habit.
Welcome to the site, Mrs Fowkes.@Nancy is absolutely correct,       19 minutes ago, Nancy said:             Welcome to the board.  You have to accept and acknowledge that smoking does not relieve or cure stress.  What it does is relieve the withdrawal symptoms which makes you feel calmer for 30 minutes or so until the withdrawal symptoms come back.  You have to decide for yourself that there is no circumstance that it is okay to smoke.                 When you want to quit, you Can quit.    When you commit to Not One Puff Ever you can have a successful quit.    You may find this post helpful   Ten Ways To Effectively Use This Forum
@Nancy@Sazerac  Thank you both very much! Advice well and truly accepted, especially the dance!     As I have broken the quit today there is no point in saying that I'm not going to have another today, that's not going to happen with the packet outside. I will give the packet to my husband and start again tomorrow. Definitely committing to the not one more puff ever.    
Hi MrsFowkes! You seem to have a pretty good understanding of what you are doing that is causing you to fail each time in your effort to stay quit. As others have said, the stress you are relieving by smoking is the stress cause by your nicotine addiction and the repeated association with smoking when you have life stress. Only you can break that cycle - no one else can do that for you. It's not easy for sure but everyone of us here has had to do the hard work to get to where we are and the good news is .... so can YOU!       Part of what you are doing when you light up a smoke in a stressful situation is you are just taking a small break to think about the situation and what you should do to get through it. You can still do that but without the smoke. Take a small break from what you;re doing and go for a walk or just to a different room and take some deep breaths, suck on a hard candy - whatever allows to to calm yourself so you can think about things. You might just find that works as well as having a smoke. Did having a smoke ever solve even 1 of your problems - I think not. Just gave you a distraction so you could think about things.        Stick around here. You will find the support top notch and that counts for a lot when you are struggling.  Go to our Daily NOPE page and pledge your nope every day. I think it will help.Edited November 30, 2018 by reciprocity
    Hello and welcome  aboard,  You have been given great advice...spend some time time here reading and Learning ....  Learn  all about the Lies ...Smoking offers you nothing ...life has problems whether you smoke or not ...smoking won't change anything ...it doesn't calm you ..its all Lies... It just relieved the withdrawal till you put nicotine back in your body.... It's so doable ...make the decision never to Stick anything in your mouth and set fire to it ...no matter what....  Looking  forward to getting to know you better ...
    Well now that you smoked, did the stress magically go away? Were you able to find a solution?       My guess is no...       Commit to not smoking. It really is as simple as that. Is it easy? No. But one you commit -and I mean really commit- to never smoke again, you can't fail.      You can make excuses until you're blue in the face (we all have), but really, it boils down to how committed you are. It's all or nothing, my friend.       Now stop smoking. Now.
One of the tips I received when my quit was new was to 'welcome the crave'.  Wish I could find those words to share with you.       The idea is - every time we hit a crave, it's an opportunity to beat it and for the quit to get stronger.  Once I understood that, I went out looking for the things that triggered an urge to smoke.  This allowed me to tackle the crave on my terms i.e. I was prepared rather than it creeping up on me unawares.  Then I would mentally play a game of beating it with a hammer and shouting 'die, crave, die'.        I stood with co-workers as they smoked, sat on the bench outside the library where I normally smoked, went outside the house after dinner, etc.  Doing this over and over again also helped prepare me for those occasional triggers that hit me unawares - I had a response I had practiced many times.        Everyone has their own way.  Lighting a cigarette will not cause the flat tire (or any situation) to improve.  We just need to learn to do these things without smoking.Edited November 30, 2018 by d2e8b8
This is mine: Beginning - through withdrawal: My plan - 6 weeks prior to quit date, I did a complete sugar detox (worse than nicotine!)  2 weeks prior I changed my brand to the weakest sort  The quit date: WalksShouting at myself NOPEGreen teaWaterBreathing exercises, 4 second in hold for 4, 4 seconds outReading and postingShowersSleepA straw with cotton wool in itHypnosis videos from YouTubeEating fruitListening to others, believingOne step at a time minutes, hours, daysStayed away from smokersNo wine until I was stronger Next 6 months: Reading and postingQuit buddiesPledging NOPEGoing for walks when crave hitLearning I had  quit not given up somethingFaced triggers early on, challenged my fearsRead my own pre SOS when junkie  thinking was aroundWatched my mum thinking I do not want to be like thatBrought nice things or did things with money savedAte like a horsePosted SOS 7 months until now: Quit buddiesReading and postingGetting fit now and healthy eatingTrigger or crave (stress)- time out, 5 minute walk or talk to myselfFinally accepting smoking willl do absolutely nothing for me or change the situationSmile I am a non smokerMoving forward into the positive changes the quit has brought my life   Would I change a thing at this point? Yes remove the WANT  the I can't, I must not Would have been so much easier from the beginning with just I DO NOT WANT!!!!! Still learning, still evolving.. Did anyone have a pre plan and what is in your quit tool box?
I didn't have a pre plan. I quit cold turkey without setting a date. I was sick, couldn't stop coughing, and asked myself why I continue torturing my lungs with nicotine? The first few months, I ate a lot of hard candies and chewed gum constantly. I'd go through a pack of gum in no time. I guess it kept my mouth busy and myself distracted, so I didn't crave as much.  I tried to drink a lot of water. This is extremely important. We (or at least I) have a habit of dehydrating myself and it was worse when I first quit.  I'd find something to do for hours and concentrate on that. I'd go to a movie or draw or read. Anything to keep my mind away from smoking.  I stayed away from smokers as well. I didn't visit my parents for a while until I felt more secure with my quit. I've been through hell with my quit, I'm not going to lie. It's not easy, but it's certainly doable and is the best decision you can make. The cravings you experience from quitting are only temporary, unlike the cravings you get as a smoker; the desperation you feel when you run out and don't have the money to buy more. 
Great advice Tracey... I had no prep, because my quit date wasn't planned... But 2 weeks after, I had -online support (reading and posting)-quit buddies-chewing a load of gum-playing with a 'tangle'-walks-doing stuff around the house (DIY, cleaning)
Oh good one! I planned mine like a military manouvre! Champix 2 weeks before one day before -joined smoking quit site, knew I would need support.Bought sweets, lots of sweets!!And peanuts, you can't be too prepared, 4 types :)And a bottle for water, cause ok, healthy living lolREAD Quit dateStunned self actually not smoking.Ate entire stash of sweets, peanuts and sloshed with water consumptionDecided more reading was needed.Read whyquit, cried a lot Days after that all blended.Shouted nope and danced from foot to foot a lotClicked my fingers when I cravedPurchased 2 boxes of peanuts (nobby's chilli nuts) from cash and carryAte a shedload of foodTreated myself to a value of treats higher then I would spend smoking lolCleaned my floor - a lot. Actually cleaned when I craved a lot, it helped to keep busy I'm not helping really but I'm happy and relaxed now.  What I will say, I wish I had of exercised sooner!!  Or walked!! Both eliminate craves and produce a really healthy feel good vibe that I really enjoy now and I didn't believe those who said it did.
Picked a date Read Allen Carr. Date was going to be the day I returned from vacation. 11 hour flight I thought would be useful. Quit a couple of days early, on vacation and decided I would accompany La B on her smokes. Thoughts/tools 1. Nobody can make me smoke. Or Quit. It is entirely up to me.2. Forever? Too much. I won't smoke today. Tomorrow? We will see about that tomorrow. 3. Smoke break? Let's walk.4. Crave? Talk to it.
I didn't have a pre plan. I quit cold turkey without setting a date. I was sick, couldn't stop coughing  Mine was the same as yours Lennna. I had always wanted to but never did. I remember thinking how pathetic I was after that coughing fit.  I wondered why I was still smoking and realized I had given up control of my health and my life to cigarettes. I wanted to quit then. At that time I remember thinking that to quit I would have to lose myself as I existed up to that point in time. The realization that I could never, ever smoke again filled me with such a sadness. I was seeing a stranger, someone who was going to lose his best friend, and I was scared. I could not see myself doing that. But I went on with that mind trip, and just did CT with a couple of weeks of Chantix. I realized later that in that moment of truth I was breaking the chains of my addiction. I had found my quit. (this will give you an insight into my tolerance for risk, I had to see it to make it real. But I couldn't see that what I had done for 35 years was risky). It is hard to break this addiction down and get real with it. Markus
Its nice seeing the term "quit toolbox" being used.  So many start a quit w/o a clue & thats sad cause those are the poor souls almost doomed to failure. Glad to see you had a solid plan-hopefully some "newbie" will think wow what a great idea. :D  :wub: 
I did a lot of reading before hand especially about being prepared for the mental aspects.  I had to have a "no loophole" argument in my mind for every crave.   I put a worry stone in my left hand front pocket where I used to carry cigarettes. I avoided people, places and things that I thought would be bad triggers until I was sure I could handle them.  I knew the phrase, "there are no extra points for making quitting harder."   I kept my focus on quitting, number one priority.  
A toolbox is a excellent idea! It will give you the tools you need to fight the cravings and fix your addiction! I did not have one, All i had was some nicorette gum, a bad chest cold, and the desire to quit! I got through it but was very hard and had i prepared myself with a tool box maybe i could of quit years ago! First item in my tool box would be the: QUIT TRAIN!
I didn't prepare either me and my wife decided not to buy any more on a whim   and 4 days latter I found a quit smoke sight for support and I lurked for a while reading post before I joined but it helped me to stay quit im so  glad I joined and stayed quit    learn all you can about this addiction and the nicotine withdrawal that you can read post and learn have a plan   so your quit will be better and youll know what to expect    if I can quit anybody can    :D :D

I was at a point where I absolutely hated smoking and couldn't justify it to myself. So even though I hadn't prepared myself, I felt ready to commit. 
This is a great collection of posts.What's in your tool box ?  What else would you add ? In my tool box was desire, education, determination, distraction, a mantra of 'Free Your Head',water, satsumas, screaming hot showers, beautiful deep breaths of oxygen, cleaning... I would add Rewards , now that I know more about nicotine's theft of natural pleasure centers. ,

    Didn’t have plan. Had extreme luck, though, that first two weeks were relatively easy. In that time I did a lot of reading, discovered qsmb and realized why I hadn’t succeeded before. All the tools and habits appeared after quitting, water, meditation apps, support group, exercise. More luck than common sense

I wasn't here yet so i know it wasn't mine.        Ok so I do not think I had much of a "quit tool box". For the first time in my life i was pumped about quitting. I mean I REALLY wanted it. I guess if I had a tool box of sorts - I was planning on smashing my cigarette machine with a hammer one month into my quit. Yeah one month just in case I decided to relapse.  To be God-honest, I did not think I would last as a non smoker. Somehow I did though. But yeah i ended up giving the machine to my sister who was gonna give it to our nephew.  I didn't really explain how to use it but figured he would probably learn. After all, he was 8 years old, he could read the instructions well enough. Ok kidding aside, he was over 30.     So I ditched everything smoking related. That was a physical tool.  My motivation to stay quit was the biggest thing.   ONE tool though, and I hope no one else suffers this - close to Thanksgiving in 2017, I ended up with cellulitis (it is NOT smoking related). It was the WORST ailment I have ever had. All I wanted to do was lay around and suffer. during those couple weeks, i wasn't gonna do jack crap to make myself feel worse. Long story short, life SUCKED during that time. Short of cash, thanksgiving ruined, it was cold, work sucked, etc.      The point is, you know Mr Titwank would probably enjoy it.
Oh my...I didn't have a tool box. I did have a journal I wrote 25 years before I actually quit...all about how I didn't want to be forced to quit...and the reasons why smoking sucked and why I needed to stop smoking but that didn't happen at that time...I just went on my merry way smoking like a chimney!       2017- It was do or die for me now....I quit while on way to hospital while having a stroke!     While in hospital I let staff know I was gonna need the patch to get through this...and they provided it! I gritted my teeth and played Solitaire on my phone for hours at a time and then I would try to sleep (not easy when in hospital!)        Once I got back home, I was filled with anxiety....knowing that I had to keep this quit or else! I had really damaged my body and more horrible stuff was to come in the next few months (CABGx3)!      I managed to keep my quit by finding an online support group (QSMB) and deep breathing, admitting I was an addict and educating myself. Every time a crave hit....I was off walking which was a miracle in itself!! I had survived a stroke with no lasting damage!     When I had hit my one year quit milestone, I was so thankful! One month later QSMB was no more!!! Ack....I knew I still needed support...luckily found the Quit Train!      What is in my toolbox now:      Smoking is not an option - it is damaging my arteries and my lungs. The fact that I now have seen that my skin looks better, my eyes look better, I no longer stink, I no longer have that awful cough.     I have the power to say NO to a crave.  I am educated about the addiction.  I am strong.    I am powerful.
Just read that Washington DC increased the cigarette tax by $2 per pack, bringing the taxes up to $5 per pack, and the average cost of a pack to $10, which according to the article is now the highest in the US.  Read the article here       As the article points out though, all smokers have to do is take a quick trip to either MD or VA where the taxes are much lower.
    Va I can understand because that's tobacco country isn't it?    Taxing the smokes is a double edge sword though because the Gov't then gets used to the revenue so punishing the industry down the road becomes more and more difficult.

I guess it depends on whether you live closer to VA or MD as to where they have to get their fix.
    When California implemented the fire safe cigarettes a year or two before the federal government did I would have my mom or sis send me cartons from Florida. A smoker will always find a way around for their addiction. But we can hope by raising the cigarette taxes so high it will discourage people from starting to smoke

Where I live, every time the government raises the cig taxes, the black market in cigarettes goes into high gear and involves the indigenous communities and their own cigarette manufacturing and distribution business.  As has been said, people find a way when they have to. As Doreen said though, perhaps it's enough to discourage younger peeps from starting.     That's where I think there's a bigger threat in the vaping area though - young people just staring out. They are trying to make it look like the thing to do. I have heard countless radio adds in the past week or so for some Vape company where they are offering a free vape "starter kit" to people between the ages of 19 & 21 (conditions apply) yeah like you have to commit to buying so many vials of vape juice or something I'm sure.       Openly luring young people into vaping though - that's just wrong!!
In 2016, when I still smoked, I voted for the $2 cigarette tax here in CA. I'd been wanting to quit for some time anyway and figured the extra $2 a pack would be the push I need (which it was).
I don't believe Eric would mind if I share his post, here.  It is imported from QSMB.       FILLING THE PAGES by Eric   A common topic a quitter might talk about since they quit smoking, is the fact that there seems to be void in their life now. Now that they're not smoking it feels as if the days have grown longer and they are unsure of how to fill this time. Sometimes this can actually put stress the new quitter, because this is so unfamiliar to them.   Cigarettes have been so deeply intertwined in their life for so long, that the new quitter is constantly being reminded that they no longer smoke just from everyday activities.    They may ask how do they unwind after work now that they don't smoke? How do they deal with stress, now that they don't smoke? How do they punctuate finishing a task now that they don't smoke?    For the smoker, that cigarette after finishing a task was like putting the period at the end of sentence. Now that they don't smoke, daily tasks can just feel like a long running sentence with no punctuation.    The cigarette was also like the smoker's pause button. If they needed to concentrate on doing something or were under a stressful situation. They would step back, smoke a cigarette and think about how to resolve the problem. Now that they don't smoke, there doesn't seem to be a pause button for the quitter. That magic button that says" Whoa give me a minute" is now gone. Now they are just left with the situation and a very unfamiliar way that they now have to deal with it without the cigarette.     One thing that should be pointed out though, is that we have lived our lives and dealt with stress DESPITE smoking, NOT because of it.  There was a fellow quitter that was talking about this and it was really stressing her out. She was having a hard time dealing with stress and everyday scenarios without smoking. She was getting discouraged about this and felt that her life just felt kind of empty since she quit. She felt that there was now a void in her life.    One thing she said though, that I thought was an interesting way to look at it, was that she said that since she quit smoking, was that she felt she now had to rewrite her life.   When I read this, for some reason it reminded me of someone writing a screenplay about the day in the life of a smoker. This is what it might say.  -----------------------------------------------------------------   THE DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SMOKER.    Dear (anonymous)    I'm just making this up, but let's just say this is how your typical day when you smoked would look like.   You wake up. Smoke a cigarette. You get ready for work. Smoke a cigarette. You have breakfast. Smoke a cigarette. You get in your car and drive to work. Smoke a cigarette. You get to work. Smoke a cigarette before going inside. You go to coffee break at work. Smoke a cigarette. You go to lunch. Smoke a cigarette. You go to second break. Smoke a cigarette. Maybe something stressful happens at work. Sneak out and smoke a cigarette. After work, as you drive home, you smoke a cigarette. You get home and unwind. Smoke a cigarette. You cook dinner. Smoke a cigarette. After eating dinner. Smoke a cigarette. Have a glass of wine or beer and of course smoke a cigarette. Watch TV. Smoke a cigarette. Get ready for bed. Smoke a cigarette. Before going to bed. Smoke a cigarette.    Let's say that it took 5 pages to write the screenplay "In the daily life of (anonymous)."  Now that you don't smoke, you're not so much rewriting your daily life, but more of editing out a lot of useless dialog in your screenplay that isn't needed to tell the story.     The problem is that now after all that editing, what use to take 5 pages to tell the story, now only takes 3 pages. Now you still have 2 blank pages that you're carrying around with you and you don't know what to do with them. This can cause anxiety. You have been so used to writing your daily life with 5 pages that writing it with only having to use 3 pages feels like there is a void in the story.   Really take a look at the dialog that you edited though and put that down on the 2 remaining pages.     Here's what it would say: Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. Smoke a cigarette. etc, etc.   You can see how useless this dialog is. It doesn't even help tell your story and on it's own it makes no sense. It's just repeated blabber.     You have two choices now. You can either take these pages and just throw them away, because you no longer need them anymore. Or you can take these two remaining pages and add something to your story. Something that maybe you've wanted to add for sometime now, but just have never done it, because this addiction was taking up those two pages. These two pages are no longer being wasted on telling the story of your addiction. They are now yours to tell any story that you wish to tell.   It isn't so much that since you quit smoking, that there is a void in your life. It is more that smoking created that void, because it took away from you. That was YOUR time being wasted, it was NOT being filled. Now that you have freed yourself from cigarettes, don't think of it as leaving a hole in your life. Think of it as giving back the endless possibilities of living life as YOU again.  Also don't think that you need a cigarette to deal with life's stress.  It isn't that you were able to deal with stress better when you smoked. It's just that you've done it for so long that way, that you are having to relearn how to do it without cigarettes. It's new and unfamiliar. Smoking under stress was a combination of relieving withdrawal, but it also gave you a minute or two to reflect on what was causing the initial stress.    If you're under stress and where the times you would smoke a cigarette, what I would do is stop. Step back and give yourself a moment just like you would do when you smoked, but now breathe deeply, calm yourself and focus on what you need to do to alleviate what is causing the stress.   Don't feel that if you're under stress that you have to attack it head on because cigarettes are no longer there to buffer what it happening. You can very easily do this without smoking. You can step back and give yourself a moment to collect yourself and you can do it without cigarettes. They are a useless middleman and you know that cigarettes don't relieve stress. They only relieve withdrawal. They don't deserve that kind of credit.     You should be proud of yourself, because you have taken your pages back.    The pages are yours now. Fill them any way you choose   Eric
    Thanks for posting this,        Eric made some wonderful posts !!!          Cristóbal
I know there is a split on this forum about regulating cigarettes.  With that in mind, I'll leave it up to each individual to decide if this is overdue or over-reach.      The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday that it will seek a ban on the sale of menthol-flavored cigarettes.     The announcement came as the agency officially released a detailed plan to also restrict the sale of flavored electronic cigarettes. It also wants to ban flavored cigars.      In a statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says the moves are aimed at fighting smoking among young people. Flavored e-cigarettes, menthol-flavored tobacco cigarettes and flavored cigars are all popular among teenagers.        "Today, I'm pursuing actions aimed at addressing the disturbing trend of youth nicotine use and continuing to advance the historic declines we've achieved in recent years in the rates of combustible cigarette use among kids," Gottlieb says.        While cigarette smoking has hit a record low in the United States, vaping has been skyrocketing. That trend has raised concerns that a new generation of young people will become addicted to nicotine.         Gottlieb says the moves were prompted by new data showing a 78 percent increase in e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48 percent increase among middle school students, from 2017 to 2018.        "These data shock my conscience," Gottlieb says.        The ban on menthol, in particular, has been long sought by public health authorities and antismoking advocates. The concern is that the flavoring masks the harshness of tobacco smoke, making it easier for people to start smoking.       "I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes," Gottlieb says.     Menthol cigarettes are especially popular among African-Americans, leading some to charge that tobacco companies have been using the flavoring to target minorities.     To read this story in its entirety, please go to this linkhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/11/15/668192356/fda-seeks-ban-on-menthol-cigarettes-to-fight-teen-smoking
    Personally I'l be happy if they ban Menthol cigarettes, as that was all I ever smoked, non menthol gave me migraines.... sooo if they ban them I know I will never ever be given a chance to relapse.   That makes me happy  
    It doesn't bother me at all if the ban menthol ciggies  Any step in the right direction to stop young people from starting is a good thing.      It bothers me more that they are not doing enough to regulate the whole Vape industry. I know up here in the Great White North, they advertise on radio, TV and anywhere they please. Having flavored vape liquid makes me crazy. Clearly that is done to induce younger people to "give it a try"? I guess before there's clear evidence of danger in vaping, there won't be much action on that front!
    I'm not sure how I feel about this, but as a lifelong Kool smoker (w/a brief flirtation with Marlboros in my teens), I have always thought that Kools were more addictive than any other cigarettes.  This is partly based on the fact that I was the only smoker I know of who would not smoke any other brand (not even one cigarette), including other menthols, if I ran out of Kools.  I would walk/drive any distance to get more Kools, even if another brand was right at hand and offered to me.  I did switch from Kools to Kool Milds, but that was about it.  For me, banning Kools would have been about the same as banning cigarettes altogether.

I'm up and down like a flippin yoyo weather I'm for or against banning smokes completely....but I do think that once smokes are banned then all nicotine products should be banned. So either I live under a rock or vaping down here just isn't the thing it is up north.... Its around, I'm see it more and more... and seriously I I can taste the strawberry flavour in the 'not smoke' cloud 10 meters away what the fruck is it doing to the deluded jukies 'smoking' it?????.... so I have never seen or heard advertising for vapes over here and I spose I have just assumed it fulls under the total ban that applies to tobacco..... will look into it... and let you know. I spose if my goverrnment decided to outlaw ciggies and vapes I'd back and support them but I'm just as likely to get splinter in me arse sittin on the fence on this one.
I'm all for it! I wish they would take all nicotine products from stores and only be allowed to sell from age regulated "smoke shops". (I know this will never happen because the money)        They just passed some regulations on Juul tho, it's a step in the right direction.https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/13/juul-stops-selling-e-cigarette-flavors-social-media-promotions/   Vape is a big thing in my small town...we have 3 churches, 2 convience type stores, McDonald's and 2 independent vape shops. Very sad "downtown" drive.
    If I had read this a couple of weeks ago I would have been marching into this thread like Rambo, firing my machine guns in the air      Now that I completely "get" nicotine addiction I feel differently.      I am all for any change that is going to save future generations from smoking.      It's a killer addiction      
I hate cigarettes.  I hate big tobacco.     That being said, I don't think outlawing tobacco is the answer.  Here in America at least, the prohibition of alcohol was an abysmal failure.  Our "war on drugs" has been an exercise in futility that has stumbled in place for over a half-century.  The law of unintended consequences always rears its head in these situations.  Not only will we not alleviate the current smoking problem by banning tobacco, we will have to deal with a host of new issues arising from yet another black market.     Ironically enough, programs intended to curb and eventually eliminate underage smoking are easier to implement so long as tobacco is legal.  Ban tobacco and the black market will be a free-for-all.Edited November 21, 2018 by Boo
Legislation has already been passed in the European Union to ban menthol cigarettes and will be implemented May 2020. This has come as part of the European Tobacco Products Directive passed into law in May 2016. There is a rumour that as part of BrexIt this piece of legislation may be torn up.      Personally I am for people to have their own freedom of choice, rather than state believing that they should make choices on behalf of everyone. Menthol allowed or not is kind of borderline though.
    I'm on the fence doing the yo yo thing like jo, but either ban nicotine or don't.  Picking and choosing the flavors allowed, as well as mostly taking a let's wait and see if it causes people to grow horns and extra toes while their lungs deflate attitude towards e-cigs and vaping, isn't likely to accomplish much.  
    I'm for getting rid of menthol. That was all I smoked and I would choose to go without than smoke a regular puff..      Now with the vape thing I thing they should ban all the silly flavours, you wanna sook in nicotine then don't candy coat it.. and I am well sick of walking through clouds of canyfloss and tootyfruity that goes on for miles.... why..  just .. why....!!
Today I read my Day 4 material from Joel Spitzer as usual, but I also learnt something by myself.       The last three days were tough in places and if there was a day to throw in the towel it would have been yesterday. I woke up this morning and I realised I felt great.         If I had given up on this quit yesterday I wouldn't have experienced the great day I had today.         I am now in Day 5.       Edited November 17, 2018 by Lilly
    Good for you, Lilly.   Yeah, if you had given up yesterday, you would have felt horrible.  I'm glad you didn't.     You are doing a great thing by quitting smoking.  Embrace that fact and protect your quit.   Keep up the awesome work!
    Good for you, Lilly! One day at a time....and they really start to add up!
    I'm so happy for you Lilly with each and every day you tackle! You're doing it girlfriend!!

    Keep up the good work!      There are going to be good days and bad days, but really, every day you're smoke free is a good day and one day closer to freedom.      Stay strong! You don't want to have to go through this ever again!
    Keep going Lilly.  It gets easier every day!

    Hey all     I was thinking of why this Forum works. As you participate you are building something over time. You can form relationships with individuals, hear advice from the group, help others maintain their quit, and make a daily NOPE pledge. All this adds up to a meaningful "thing". The "thing" begins to act as a counterbalance to the urge to smoke. When I have cravings I think of this forum first. It is not guilt, (they will judge me), but more of a feeling that I would be sacrificing all that I have done.  It is making this quit different. During other quits the urge to smoke was meet with abstract ideas of negative consequences. These were often flimsy and wouldn't hold up. This is a strong, positive, structure we are building. And it works.
    Very well said kdad, very well said !!!!
    Great post kdad, and that's what worked for me too  
    That's lovely Kdad 
    I agree. I am not one for social media. Don't even have a Face-Plant account but this place is different.   There's a purpose to it and I was very pleasantly surprised at how effective it was once I joined up. Not sure I would have made it on my own?
    When I hopped on the Train, I had serious doubts about all online forums.       That was two years and eight months ago.  And...I'm still here.     The Train rolls on.

    Very good post!! I feel connected to everyone's quit and want to help carry their load when it gets heavy and share in their joys with each milestone!  This place works. There is so much POWER here! 
    Kdad,  I feel the same about this forum.  I know that if I had not stumbled across it, I would still be smoking.  These wonderful friends, from around the world guided me through the difficulties of quitting smoking and made me feel the true strength inside me.  Pledging and helping others continues to solidify your own quit.

    One week -- so important -- well done and enjoy the day
A week not smoking (based on a pack-a-day habit):       A day of your life saved.           Saving 35 USD or 27 GBD or 2 troy ounces of triple 9 fine silver (that's 10 pounds of pure silver yearly!).         Approximately 16 hours doing something else besides smoking.   Oh, the possibilities....
    Yay for you and Congrats! Rewards are soooo important!! Most important...your health!
    Well done!!!
Should you come across moments when quitting seems too arduous,when you feel like you just can't take it anymoreyou must forge ahead, faking it if needed,  to get through another day.  You must shake yourself and understand againthat this is just an addictionand you are the conqueror.    Smoking will not make your frustration or your withdrawal go away.Smoking is all about the management of withdrawal.        These moments of despair or frustration that your mind is not yet freeare not long lived and not commands for you to smoke.They are opportunities for you to introduce new ideas, new rewards to your brain.    Change your thoughts, use a physical or a visual prompt. Be your own dominant/dominatrix.Insist your body obey you and release it from the captivity of nicotine addiction.The rewards will be awesome.  No kidding.

    I have been in a constant cycle of quit/relapse/quit/relapse for such a long time and it's exhausting.      If you are in that relapse cycle too and really want to quit, educate yourself properly by watching the Joel Spitzer videos on this forum, head over to the WhyQuit website to watch even more and spend lots of time here for support, encouragement and distraction.      A good starting point if you are planning to quit is on the link below.      https://whyquit.com/joel/dayzero.htm    
    Hi Lilly,       I am glad you have been using these resources, they certainly have helped so many people quit smoking over the years.       The education you are getting is critical to helping you put your mind in the right place, and finally ending this awful cycle.     The support from this forum is also very important. There is almost always somebody here to help if you have a bad day.     Both education and support are key in their own ways, and both will help you finally end this awful cycle.          Cristóbal        
    Thankyou Cristobal 
    Yeah I have been thinking about quitting myself.
Day 3 was difficult as I have been extremely emotional. I am not sure if I can explain my feelings in words but will try.       I was watching my Day 3 videos by Joel Spitzer and there was one that I had watched before. When I watched it the first time I felt sad but continued to smoke. When I watched it earlier it brought out feelings in me that I didn't even realise were there.      After watching it today I sobbed for hours for my own mum. I watched my mum die due to smoking and then I smoked my way through her death, her funeral and then during a very long period of grief.         Today I feel as though I am going through a second cycle of grief. My beautiful mum was taken from us because she was addicted to smoking. This thought has tortured me most of the day and my heart is breaking for her.       I'm seeing this addiction for what it really is and I'm angry. I'm keeping that anger for another day though as today I need to cry only for my mum.        I'm now in Day 4.Edited November 14, 2018 by Lilly
It's good to see you Lilly, your feelings are all normal at this stage of your quit. I too lost both my dad and my uncle (his little brother) to smoking related cancer. And I too smoked through it all and continued for the next 14 years after my dad passed.   We can't change the past, we can only learn from it...….    Well done on getting through day 3 and now being on day 4. You're doing great!  xoxo
    Oh dear, Lilly, Smoking leaves a sad and tragic legacy to any survivors of a smoke related illness.     I am so sorry you lost your Mother. Grieving takes a long time and comes up unexpectedly years and years after you thought your grief was complete. Give yourself time and space whenever grief comes up for you.   It is all part of the healing journey.      Smoking hid so many of our deep feelings.   I used to think I was in touch with my feelings but, after I quit and so many feelings came tumbling down,  I realized the veil of smoke hid so much.  So much.     Be kind to yourself and give yourself a reward for this day.    Tomorrow, will dawn a new day.
Oh Lilly, I am so sorry.  We all looked past the ones we lost to smoking.  Ignoring reality was the only way that legitimized our continued smoking.  We were all going to be the lucky ones.   Fortunately we had the opportunity to see it for what it was.   I am so glad you have made it through day 3.  It sounds as if you have turned a corner by being able to relate so differently to the films. Your still in the tough period.  Your emotions will probably be all over the place. Take care and hang tough.  You are doing great!
Lilly thanks for posting this.  I too went through the same thing, except that I smoked for many years after even though I was angry about what smoking had done to my mother.  It is strange how this addiction works.  The emotions you are going thru are par for course -- keep strong and keep coming back-- you are doing fantastic.  Congrats on getting thru day 3!!!!!!
    Keep marching
Thankyou everyone Edited November 15, 2018 by Lilly
I am sorry Lilly and I’m proud of you and your strength. Usually day 3 is critical and cravings peak then, most probably it’s related to nicotine leaving the body. With each day it’s goingto be easier. Take care!
I am so sorry to read this, Lilly.  Smoking truly is horrible.      Congratulations on making it through day 3.  Keep fighting.  Your quit will get easier with time.
The first day is done and I am giving myself a massive pat on the back and having my own little celebration.        I'm really proud that I got through today. Mentally wasn't too bad and physically it was bearable. Only negative is I have a really big ulcer in my mouth which is so painful and no amount of Bonjela will help.       Joel Spitzer has put together videos to watch during the first week which are on the link below. I watched all the Day 1 section today and learnt so much, plus it was a great way to keep busy.        I'm now in Day 2.    https://whyquit.com/joel/index-guide.html
Great job   Say NOPE a bunch.   Drink some fruit juice- blood sugar will be low. Nicotine releases it somehow and your going to be out of whack for a week.     On to "bakon only advise". Nobody else will tell you this. ...ready.  Notebook out....      outside of this group, not many will know the struggle of the first couple days. Not many pat on the backs. Good jobs are few and rare.   So even your closest humans might not notice....as a result You must REWARD YOURSelf  .  Think of some little object you want but never pick up. An ice cream, a magazine, a hair brush, a book.  Anything small and self satisfying.     Buy it. you earned it.      every day for first week you must REWARD YOURSelf.  It reinforces the quit. It might be the only praise you receive on some days.   Now when you leave house don't forget....NOPE and a reward.  Edited November 13, 2018 by bakon
    Congratulations, Lilly on your first few days of Freedom.   NOPE your way through the coming days.  I am glad you find Joel helpful,  I (and many others) did as well.  It was through him that I finally understood my addiction   and this knowledge became the premier tool in building my quit.      
Congratulations on getting past day 1 Lilly  Now it's just a matter of repeating day 1 over and over again to get your forever quit. I read your blog yesterday and loved your quit song. So much so that I started a quit song thread in the social section if you'd like to put it there. Maybe it'll help someone else also
    Well done Lilly.. You should be proud of yourself!  Yes keep as busy as you can no matter how much out of your comfort zone it is & just ride the emotions because they will be up and down.    Were all with you 
    Thanks for your posts guys. It makes such a big difference to have the congratulations 
    Well done Lilly, you are on your way -- and take to heart what Bakon said above, it is so true.
    Aye well done Lilly, just keep going!! 
    Congratulations Lilly! Another day almost done!
    Thanks so much. I'm going to post the first three days just to keep the excitement 
    Post everyday. I did for a while. Add to it occasionally.   Then post on other people threads. Spend time in here. It’s free and works.             Find my thread Starting Now.  
    Thankyou everyone 
Day 2 is done but today I felt a little less upbeat than yesterday.         The ulcer in my mouth seems to have moved it's friends in. I can now feel a few ulcers which is making eating virtually impossible due to the pain. I'm drinking plenty but I think I really could do with a proper meal. I thought I would have some soup tonight but for some reason I didn't even enjoy it. I don't know if that's because of the ulcers, if my taste buds are changing or if it's the two tubes of Bonjela I have tucked in my cheeks.      In a perverse way I'm actually enjoying what withdrawal is bringing. This is the worst quit physically I have ever had but I stuck it out and another day is done.      I watched all the Joel Spitzer Day 2 videos today and gained more knowledge to keep me focused on the end goal.         I'm now in Day 3.Edited November 13, 2018 by Lilly
    Yay Lilly, you're doing it  AND you'll never have to go through those first two days again as long as you stay quit  Have you tried gargling with warm salt water for your ulcers? 
    I'm sorry to hear about your ulcers, Lilly, but keep up the great work with your quit.  As Jill said, make this your forever quit and you will not have to go through this again.
Yes those ulcers can be a pain but you are handling it well.  I agree with Jillar, try some warm salt water gargles to see if that will help.  Great job on getting thru day 2.
    Way to go Lilly.  Just keep hanging tough.  In the beginning it just seems to go so slow.  That nicotine will soon be out of your system and then it is just a matter of retraining your brain.  I do hope your ulcers heal soon.  I am sure your physician has given you the best treatment for them.  I do know how painful they are.

Those first cigarettes were not something we liked at the beginning.     We had to pay the price of coughing and feeling dizzy, to become a proud smoker.        That was what happened when we opened the smoking door to the addiction, years ago.         Now, you must go through the same door to get out of where you were.        The price of your exit, is withdrawl symptoms, however the process of leaving involves much more time and discomfort.           Smoking sucked when we started.     Smoking sucked when we smoked.      Smoking sucked when we stopped.         What does this tell you ???     Your perverse feelings of enjoying withdrawl, show that you have had enough of this garbage.            Keep going and never look back, there was never anything good about smoking, it all sucked -  you are doing excellent !!!           Cristóbal                                                                Edited November 14, 2018 by Cristóbal

How are you doing on your day 3, @Lilly?
    Thank you everyone 
https://www.yahoo.com/news/fda-gives-e-cigarette-makers-183914968.html      It's a start...I watched 2 young boys walk down my block passing a vape thing between them...huge clouds of white following them. Very sad...prob stole it from their parents and filled it with nicotine that taste like candy.
    Yes, it is a start. I have friends who are letting their teenage son vape in front of them even though neither of them have ever smoked! Supposedly the vape is nicotine free but some studies say that there are other chemicals in them besides nicotine that are hooking these kids 
Will these kids go from vape to a crack pipe? Oxygen is all we should put in our lungs....          WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People who smoke high-voltage e-cigarettes have greater exposure to formaldehyde, a suspected carcinogen, than those who keep the voltage low, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.   The study, which critics say is misleading and lacks context, is the latest contribution to a debate on the safety of e-cigarettes that has so far has yielded little long-term data, though most experts believe they are less toxic than combustible cigarettes.  Researchers from Portland State University took flavored nicotine liquid made by Halo Cigs, a private company, and tested it in a personal vaporizer from Innokin. The vaporizer allows consumers to adjust the voltage from 3.3V to 5.0V. The higher the voltage the greater the nicotine kick, but also the greater the amount of formaldehyde.   E-cigarette liquids typically contain propylene glycol, which when heated is known to release formaldehyde gas. "Vaping" at high voltage also produced formaldehyde-containing compounds known as hemiacetals, the researchers found.Edited September 13, 2018 by Whispers
    Thank you Whispers...this is scarey stuff ,to read for our yougens...   It's hard to imagine what damage this will do in time.....  After all ..we were told it was OK go smoke....well my generation ....  Havn,t enough folks died ..to make a profit.....     
    I've said it before and I'll repeat myself once more: big tobacco is well aware of the current trends in nicotine delivery systems.  The same merchants of death who peddled the deadliest consumer product in the history of the world have diversified and are now heavily invested in the e-cig market.  Only the gadget is new.  The bullshit is the same as it ever was.
    I've met adults who think they've quit smoking because they switched to vape or E-Cig.   No point in arguing with them, you won't win.
    ^^My sister is one of them! 
    OK... so the big argument is "its less toxic than combustible cigarette" .... IT'S STILL TOXIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      So, lets say I took a shit on your lounge room floor... and it was a huge one, would make a cow feel inadequate about its pats huge... and say I took a shit in your rumpus room but it was tiny, I mean there was hardly any shit there at all.. that second shit, that was less shit than the first one, would be ok because its less shit, right? Yeah-Nah... shit is shit and toxins are toxins.... no level should be acceptable and I can guarantee there would be an issue if I shit in any room of your houses regardless of how big or small it was... so how then can it be acceptable that less toxins are ok. Seriously??       Arguing that LESS toxins makes it better is complete bullshit! How do they get away with this????       OK... so maybe a bit controversial here but if I had a loved one who didn't want to quit and they switched to NRT gum... I'd be happy with that as a smoking alternative... but vaping.. nope just as bad as far as I am concerned.  
Nope, I agree, big shit/little shit... all stinks.

    The worst part of vaping is that it is the douchebag method of ingesting nicotine. Kind of like driving a Toyota Prius. They walk around doing that vaping crap like it is SOOOO cool.      Also, they claim vaping is less toxic than cigarettes. Somehow I find that hard to believe. Think of this also - a smoker puts off a little bit of smoke with each exhale. A vape slave though puts off more smoke/steam/whatever than a ninja ever did.

I have a friend from high school who NEVER would have smoked cigarettes back in the day.  20 years later, he now vapes and sees nothing wrong with it.      Yeah, big tobacco knows exactly what they are doing in hooking this next generation of nicotine users, mostly kids but also adults who never would have smoked nasty-smelling tobacco cigarettes.

    Vaping is like,  like something you would have seen in the Twilight Zone when they were in the future.      Electric cigarettes.        Pretty crazy.
The first patent for an electronic cigarette was filed in 1927.... the first commercially viable one had a patent filed in 1963... but none of the tobacco companies would take it up, it is believed they were just waiting for the patent to expire so they could get the tech for free.... its nothing new but its like they sat on it until cigarettes became so unviable that it was time to have a plan B ready to go... which just makes me even angrier at big tobacco.

November 14 is World Diabetes Day and if you're looking for yet another of the 50 million already available excuses to quit and stay quit why not quit to help prevent yourself developing type 2 diabetes or for those of you who already have diabetes... quit now to improve your diabetes management.       We now know that smoking causes type 2 diabetes. In fact, smokers are 30–40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than nonsmokers. And people with diabetes who smoke are more likely than nonsmokers to have trouble with insulin dosing and with controlling their disease.The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher your risk for type 2 diabetes. No matter what type of diabetes you have, smoking makes your diabetes harder to control. If you have diabetes and you smoke, you are more likely to have serious health problems from diabetes. Smokers with diabetes have higher risks for serious complications, including:       Heart and kidney disease            Poor blood flow in the legs and feet that can lead to infections, ulcers, and possible amputation (removal of a body part by surgery, such as toes or feet)         Retinopathy (an eye disease that can cause blindness)           Peripheral neuropathy (damaged nerves to the arms and legs that causes numbness, pain, weakness, and poor coordination)         If you are a smoker with diabetes, quitting smoking will benefit your health right away. People with diabetes who quit have better control of their blood sugar levels.
What the Fluffies say--"awwww..Sorry about your relapse..get back on track and start again"  "Never quit the quit"   "Life is tough yes..but you can do this"  "Get back on the horse and do it again"  "You've got this, YAY!!!"    What the Toughies say--"Be truthful with  yourself"  "Everything you are saying is BS"  "where was your SOS????"  "you need to take your quit seriously as if your life depends on it!!!"  "stop with the excuses!!"  "you think I'm being too hard on you?  Well try getting cancer!", "easy peasy!!!"        The truth is...on a successful quit board....we need BOTH types of support.  That's why it works here.  They compliment each other.  They are both vital.       Sometimes you need a gentle hand,  sometimes you need a swift kick in the butt and to be called out on your s**t...and sometimes you need both at the same time.        But...I believe..despite our different styles of support...we agree on more than we disagree, that is for sure.     One word we all use frequently...no matter what type of support we dish out....is  NOPE!!       I think we also agree...that everyone can quit smoking.         What else do you think we all agree on when it comes to quitting smoking?

    I think we all agree that bakon was dropped on his head as a baby...…   I also think we agree on how nice it is not to stink of stale smoke...…..
    We all think we miss some of the oldies around here...  We also agree this addiction kills more people than all the wars together....you need to fight for your quit ....
    I think we all agree that smoking sucks.    -and    I think we all agree the chicks can't count.
    I think we can all agree that anybody can quit smoking because we are proof !   Quitting smoking is ultimately DO-ABLE no matter who you are.   All it takes is a commitment to never taking another puff again...ever.     I hope we all agree that honesty, truth and integrity concerning our quits is essential.    We no longer believe the addict's lies and must be rigorous in revealing them to protect our quits.         We likely agree that the sticks Cheat.  Always have.     
I have to admit I am a fluffy.  You probably figured that out right away.  I can't accept anyone being a lost cause (except maybe bakon. He is either a bad boy or a dirty old man lol).I think you need all the personalities combined together for the forum to work.  Sometimes it just takes the right person clicking with another person for things to work.   I have great love and respect for you all because you have helped me save my life.

@Linda Thomas you are most definitely a toughie! (A tough lady that is) I love watching you quit! A true inspiration          You can't quit and smoke at the same time. It's one or the other. (And one=all)     The only true way to quit smoking is to stop putting the dang things in your mouth and then Never! Take! Another! Puff!     Education on nicotine addiction builds a firm quit foundation.     
    I think I am a Fluffy... dunno figure you catch more flies with honey than vinegar... doesn't mean I don't care when someone looses their quit... just .. oh I dunno... maybe its the big sister in my, I just want to do the gently, gently... I always try to find something positive... ironically if I was to SOS personally the foot up the arse, tough love approach would achieve more in keeping me quit than the hand holding approach. 
    Thankfully ...I didn't have a relape here....I knew I had far too much to lose....but if I had ...I would have expected  tough tough love ...   I knew the Quit Train Peeps were watching my back ...No matter what was said ...
I will take fluffy, toughie and everything in-between.      I have learnt in the last 24 hours it's hard to quit alone.         Sometimes you don't appreciate your quit family until they're not there.
    I wish booger Linda thomass and jiller (which I think is slang for what women do when they "double click the mouse") weren't here.      Then again glad they are. Like hanging out with people so dumb I look smart.
    I don't really subscribe to fluff or tough.  Just the facts will suffice.       Quitting is simple.  Smoking offers nothing positive.  Every "reason" to smoke is just an excuse to get a nicotine fix.     Keep it simple folks.  There's no point in making straight lines crooked.    
    Its all a matter of nope!

I am 26 days in and I'm feeling weird..... off..... like something's not right. My craves are few and mild, yet I have a sense of something is just not quiet right. I don't feel like a non smoker, but more like a smoker who is trying to quit smoking. I repeat it to myself that I don't smoke and I am a non smoker, and I can honestly say that I am not too worried about slipping, at least not right now. I do think about cigarettes a lot, not really about smoking them or reminiscing about them..... not really thinking anything in particular about them, just thinking about them. Like my brain is constantly on alert, even when I'm not craving or stressed or agitated. I feel I have this big red flashing no smoking sign deep in my brain.... and its constantly there, constantly flashing... no matter what I'm thinking about.... kids, work, vacation, sex, food, scented or unscented hair spray ... doesn't matter..... there is always the big red flashy no smoking sign in the background somewhere. Did anyone else experience the feeling of something being off??? I didn't post an S.O.S. or anything because I really don't feel my quit is in jeopardy.... I have no desire to smoke at the moment, I just feel blah.
    Yes, those feelings are all normal and so frustrating! I had them as did many of us. Just power through and one day very soon you will wake up and smoking will not be constantly on your mind, I promise you 
    Yes verrrrry normal. For me it was a weird something is missing feeling! I should be doing something! Something I always did and still do on the rare occasion...is say to myself don't let a thought turn into a crave. And just bat away any thoughts of smoking. You are doing a grand job btw, keep up the good work

I repeat it to myself that I don't smoke and I am a non smoker, and I can honestly say that I am not too worried about slipping, at least not right now.             That was the last hurdle I cleared in my quit.  It was about eight or nine months in before I really started feeling like a nonsmoker who was permanently done with the cigarettes.  It wasn't a huge issue.  I wasn't struggling with my quit.  There was just a mental block there.  Eventually I was able to flip that switch, but it took some time.        Years of addiction and conditioning can take some time to undo.
    Like the others have said, I think we all go through that "something's not right" feeling for some period of time. Smoking was tied to everything in our lives and suddenly, it's not! That's a huge change in almost everything we do and feel throughout each day. As for that Red NO SMOKING Warning Sign flashing in the background, I think that's pretty normal too. I know I had to really focus on being a non-smoker for probably the best part of my first year. It didn't seem natural to me and I wasn't yet comfortable with the fact that I was a non-smoker. Now, it's second nature to me and I even have trouble seeing myself as a used-to-be smoker

This might be your time to fake it til you make it! Keep up the positive self talk and just find something else to do!  Congratulations on your almost month free!
    Yeah, it feels weird, smoking used to be always there and suddenly it’s gone. And then all the weird bodily adjustments. But one day not-smoking will become the new normal and your body better than ever. Keep on going, you’re doing great!

I am 13 months into the quit and sometimes, like once a week, I just get this weird impulse like "time to smoke". Believe me I have thought about "Well I am doing good, just one won't hurt."  But yeah, things can feel "off".        The only advice I can offer is keep temptation at bay best you can.     The good part of quitting is our health improves, some things immediately and some things over several weeks or months. The shit part though is we end up having to pay some mental dues, in the form of cravings.

My craves are few and mild, yet I have a sense of something is just not quiet right. I don't feel like a non smoker, but more like a smoker who is trying to quit smoking. I repeat it to myself that I don't smoke and I am a non smoker, and I can honestly say that I am not too worried about slipping, at least not right now. I do think about cigarettes a lot, not really about smoking them or reminiscing about them..... not really thinking anything in particular about them, just thinking about them. Like my brain is constantly on alert, even when I'm not craving or stressed or agitated. I feel I have this big red flashing no smoking sign deep in my brain.... and its constantly there, constantly flashing... no matter what I'm thinking about.... kids, work, vacation, sex, food, scented or unscented hair spray ... doesn't matter..... there is always the big red flashy no smoking sign in the background somewhere. Did anyone else experience the feeling of something being off??? I didn't post an S.O.S. or anything because I really don't feel my quit is in jeopardy.... I have no desire to smoke at the moment, I just feel blah.               One month into your quit is not a long time.    Please be kind to yourself, nurture yourself and reward yourself !  The receptors in your brain are being re-fitted one by one with each thought you have that isn't accompanied with a blast of nicotine.  This takes time and I was really fed up with thinking smokey thoughts.  I wasn't going to smoke, I was just weary of fighting the thoughts about not smoking...the issue of addiction etc... etc...etc...       You can start replacing smokey thoughts with other thoughts.    I had to make it simple.    I started to replace smokey thoughts with a visual prompt of beauty,    like 'that light on that leaf or, that shadow from my hand, that beautiful cloud'....   I also used aural prompts by putting on a favorite song.        Be sure to reward yourself in some way when you replace a thought.  This helps getting your receptors back, working for your rewards.   I guess, my reward was finding something pretty to look at or listen to but, slowly opening a Satsuma was a sensory reward too.      Edited November 8, 2018 by Sazerac

    What you are doing with all that money ,you have saved since you quit....   Does anyone want to take me to dinner ????  You must be loaded ...
    I just turned in my reward chips with my husband.  I am getting new family room carpeting and this new waterproof laminate plank (that looks like wood) for my kitchen. We have needed it replaced for quite a while.  How quickly the money adds up when you quit.  In a few more months, I'll be able to redo the bathroom.

    Yup. It happened. I told myself I wouldn't let it happen, and now here I sit. Traded one addiction for another. I mean full blown, raging mad winter green Lifesaver addiction. I've eaten sooooooooo many. And I want to eat soooooooo many more. And I really don't care if too much is not good for me... Imma eat them until my bathroom smells like a candy cane factory when I'm done using it. Hi my name is Mary and I am a mintaholic.
    Hey Mary,       Having your bathroom smell like a candy cane is actually not that bad an idea...but yes too much of anything is not good enough I suppose.   
    I was a soft peppermint puffs addict for a good solid year lol
    Spearmint Lifesavers were mine with water, driving had to have blowpop or a tootsie pop
    Don't nudge into my Altoids supply, or my Lemon Head supply, or my stash of Satsumas !  I am still possessive about them, lol.
    So of course no cigarettes for a month now, that is awesome.        But the bathroom, will it be like this -    Someone walks in and says, "WOW, this restroom smells so minty fresh!"  Someone else goes - "Oh yeah, it always does after Mary drops her morning deuce".   And then people walk in going "ooohhhhh" and "aaaahhhh".        I know when i use the restroom people think it is a Sunday Service because the fragrance makes people blurt out, "Jesus Christ!"    Well umm anyways...     I am not a fan of wintergreen lifesavers. people either love them or hate them. Or somewhere in between.    You can have my supply.  
I was sitting thinking today, that over the last year I have had two relapses, and this is my 3rd attempt in a year to quit, now I am seriously beginning to realise that way back last year I would not have even attempted to quit if it had not been for finding, joining and taking part in this Forum, being able to see that I am not alone, that there are different ways to quit, that not everyone's quit is the same, that it doesnt matter if you relapse the support is here to help you re- quit, seeing so many quitters who have been committed to keeping the quit, helping others that are struggling, offering support and advice its amazing, being part of this forum has certainly prompted me to keep on and get to my sticky quit.  Outside of the forum we have our Doctors, leaflets, internet advice, not quite the 24/7 help and support we all need, and the beauty of it is, all it takes is the touch of a button and we can interact with someone, talk out our quit, socialise, laugh, share things and connect.  Pretty amazing isn't it.  I can honestly say that if I hadn't stumbled across my little family in the corner of the internet my relapse last year would still be my relapse now, it was the thought of everyone here, that pushed me that little bit harder to come back and to try again.  So glad I did.  Quitting smoking is one of the most amazing things that you can do, one of the others is joining this forum.  Quitting is no longer a scary and lonely trip but more of an adventure with people who care and support, leading you to live a better, healthier stronger and more fulfilling life.
that's awesome Jackie! I couldn't agree more....I am a firm believer in support and what that does to and for a person. Once you are on the Quit Train...even if one relapses it's difficult to go back to "mindless smoking" -- You are educated about nicotine addiction and once you know the truth......it's hard to stick your head back in the sand. Bravo you! and congratulations on 6 days smober! :)
Nicely said Jackie. I really appreciate everything this forum has done for me. This time around, I know my quit is my sticky/forever quit. Thanks to the QT, I've had a great support system throughout my quit, which has helped me stay focused and committed to NOPE.  I'm extremely proud of you Jackie and know you have struggled; I applaud you for not giving up, regardless of what happens. That shows me how serious you are about quitting. 
A brilliant and honest post jackie....Being apart of this forum gives you all the support ,to get you to reach your destination....After countless of trying to quit and failing....It took this journey with this group of folks to keep me focused....This will be your sticky..... Well done sweetheart....
that it doesnt matter if you relapse the support is here to help you re- quitWhile it is essential to help those who relapse, this is a very dangerous thought. I would also like to add that even with how little time I usually spend here, I see many folks relapsing without saying a word (let alone posting an SOS). Obviously the board can only help you, if you use it.
I remember posting a SOS, on another board when I was really thinking of saying fck it again, and smoke. But, I thought I would try the the SOS first, to see if it would help. The "helpful" responses poured in, immediately. The only one that sticks in my mind now, was the one that replied (if I remember it correctly),  "No, you don't", (feel like smoking). I was a little hurt at that one. I also remember posting a short time later, that my strong urge to smoke had dissipated, before I had finished writing the SOS. Then, I knew he was right. My membership of that board and willingness, to do what was suggested in it, had "saved the day".
I think it's a superbly powerful quit tool to have people who would will you on. Also the information is invaluable. As Babs said, an educated relapse is always going to be a problem...well done you for not re submerging your head in the sand and coming back.  To (kinda) quote Markus he said to guard the quit. That it was the vigilant quit that survived, nothing to do with who was stronger. To (kinda) quote Bakon, NOPE! Can't argue nope, nothing there to argue with, it's a strong statement and one that brooks no disagreement. It's sayings like this and the video's MQ posts and Joels words that we wouldn't get from another place. Smoking cessation clinics are one persons voice, alone it is not entirely believable for some. For me Jac I'm so pleased you're back! No more doubts chicky, hold fast and know "this too will pass" cause it's true, everything, every feeling good or bad passes.  x
When I quit I just decided one evening and smoked my last.  The next morning I was smoke free and started searching the internet for help.  I'm a firm believer that a group of people going through the same thing is better than any other help so I was searching for a forum of people stopping smoking.  I found the QT and was busy reading, reading and reading some more.  It was such a help to realize that each step of the way was "normal".  Some people reach stages faster than others and it was nice to see that it was OK if you were earlier or later than other people.  Jackie, I feel this is your sticky quit! 
I find it helpful that there are friendly people reaching for the same goal, all ex-smokers so can see from your perspective. I find the scare tatics of heath service all quite ineffective and patronising. 
I found it encouraging when people reached back to me - and assured me that what I was feeling was normal, and would resolve itself. I find it serves to remind me when I reach back to people. Accountability - I did not want to let my friends down. I did not want to feel that I had weakened another's quit by quitting my quit. and...I'm scared of my Quit Buddy

This is why I think it's important too....I agree with stu and marti...You know your going to feel like you have let down the folks who are supporting you 100 per cent...This helped me so much in my early days.....telling my quit friends I have smoked and hear thier disappointment...No....I carnt do that.....so I carry on.....it worked......for me.....
    Bumping this ...    Please add ...why this fabulous place works .for you ....
I lurked for ten or so months here and on QSMB, educating myself on nicotine addiction  and learning how different people handle their quit.        I realized that I wasn't 'more addicted' than anyone else   and saw how some struggled more, some less. I recognized that it was up to me how difficult I was going to make my quit.    All the Elders kept saying, It Will Get Better and Better.  They didn't lie.        Not being a 'joiner' or one for 'groups',   I initially joined to thank the people that had blazed a trail for me   and then understood that I could pay back the gift that was given to me.        But, it is not pure altruism that keeps me here.    It is the camaraderie, the power of community and being held accountable that helps me stay honest with myself/my quit. When I see responses to an SOS or when someone is in trouble or hurting in some way,    the outpouring of concern and care and useful information makes my heart so glad    and I have been comforted and supported many times through the years.   We are family.      Thank y'all,    new quitters and those with years of a successful quit, ALL of you make my world a better place.        SEdited November 12, 2018 by Sazerac
I'm in a better place now to answer this question.. It's simple...This place saved me from a very uncertain future...   After smoking 52 years...I had run out of chances...to quit...this HAD to be my last chance...  Myself and my two feet were about to part company...    I had that many failed attempts ...it's impossible to count...  Searching through the internet I stumbling onto the most wonderful people.. Who never gave up encouraging me...day by day...I was actually quitting..   I was making friends..some that will be with me forever..whether they are still here or not...  I've learnt computer stuff...just enough to get me by...and post a picture or two ( sorry Babs )... At the beginning it might have all been in vain...  But !!! ..Thankfully ..up till today..My feet and I are still together...   So what does this place mean to me ....EVERYTHING.....

That is it.  Why I could not quit before.  I remember the doctor, at the smoking cessation clinic not even looking me in eyes and just handing me the information on smoking.  I felt as if she looked down on me.  I walked out of there feeling the same as I walked in.  I came across this forum, while looking for ways to quit on the internet.  I lurked for about a week.   I finally joined and was able to quit, cold turkey.     There is so much care and support here.  They may be scattered throughout the globe but it is as if they reach through your computer,  take your hand and lead you through this difficult journey.   They understand the battle,  the emotions, the self loathing and the grip this awful addiction has on you.     It is true that you begin to care about these people and you don't want to let them down.   I also found that helping to support others made me want to keep my quit.
My doctor told me I had ten to twelve years left to live if I didn't quit. The junkie in me was thinking ' ok, that's 62, around the same age my dad died' But then his comment made me mad and I set out to prove to him he was wrong and I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.    So I kept googling my quit symptoms and the searches always led me to my old forum. I too had never been a part of a forum so I lurked for about three weeks. Then one day while there I saw first-hand an SOS and how everyone came running to get that member past it. It worked, they got past it and I signed up right then and there.  I truly believe I would not have quit without the forum and the people who I have come to care about like family.   Plus too was the fact that I had my quit buddies who I couldn't let down
Oh, Jillar, I found that same forum about 2 months after I quit due to having what is known as a CVA while at work..(cardio vascular incident)......a stroke!!! Due to family history of cardiovascular problems, my smoking was leading me to an early death, for sure! I smoked for 40+ years!  It was now or never in terms of quitting....which I did with the help of the hospital staff providing the patch that first week! Finding that QSMB forum two months later was the best thing ever.....I was able to finally educate myself about my addiction by reading and watching Joel's videos. It was very upsetting when that forum shut down....I wish I had some way to find some of those who befriended me there....although some are here such as you...and a few others like Beazel and Lin-Quitting are here but not as active anymore. Glad to have made some new friends here.....
    Whether or not there exists a thing like No Man's Land.. I am definitely in it.     This thread got me thinking. And.... well, a bit embarassed to ask but... ... i thought... maybe I need a quit buddy who I can reach outside this forum, like via whatsapp. Just to silently scream once in a while, or to reach out when I need to. Ofcourse I'd be there to return the favour. Please PM me if you are interested in exchanging quit sitter services.      
    You shouldn't be embarrassed to ask that at all MLMR. A lot of us have or had quit buddies our first year quit. I had several and since I don't have a smartphone I was at least able to text my quit buddy if I was away from home and internet. Quit buddies work and I highly recommend them 
    I do not whatsapp but I sent my email to you

When it comes around next year ..you will be much stronger..and have had your Lido Party...and us old Phartes love a party...   So we need you all to make sure you get there...
    During the first year there are a plethora of 'seasonal' triggers.  Autumn/Winter may include family 'togetherness' which is sometimes not very 'together'  and triggers an urge to smoke.  These emotional responses are normal. Some of our families are a piece of work, for sure.   Keep in mind H A  L T.  Are you Hungry- Angry (emotional)-Lonesome (bored, fed-up lol)-Tired-Stressed out ? Do you just need a break ?  Step outside and take a few clear clean breaths.    Center yourself.    Congratulate yourself on quitting smoking.  Give yourself a reward for keeping it together.     You quit smoking !  Celebrate your freedom every day.

https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/smoking-cessation-news-628/the-sooner-you-quit-smoking-the-better-739252.html       "These findings underscore the benefits of quitting smoking within five years, which is a 38 percent lower risk of a heart attack, stroke or other forms of cardiovascular disease," said study author Meredith Duncan, from Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. "The bottom line is if you smoke, now is a very good time to quit," Duncan said in an American Heart Association news release.  Her team also found that it takes more than 15 years from the time you quit until your cardiovascular disease risk returns to the level of those who never smoked -- so the sooner you quit, the better.    Cigarette smoking in America is declining and leaving a growing population of former smokers. Earlier studies have hinted that the risk for heart disease lessens within a few years after quitting, but these studies haven't looked closely at smoking history, including changes in smoking habits.  In this study, Duncan and her colleagues analyzed data on the lifetime smoking histories of nearly 8,700 people who took part in the Framingham Heart Study.    At the beginning of the study, none of the participants suffered from cardiovascular disease. Over 27 years, researchers compared the risk for heart disease among people who never smoked with those who quit. They found that more than 70 percent of heart disease occurred in current or former smokers who smoked at least 20 pack-years -- smoking one pack a day for 20 years.   But smokers who quit within the last five years cut their risk for cardiovascular disease by 38 percent, compared with people who continued to smoke. Moreover, it took 16 years after quitting for the risk of cardiovascular disease to return to the level of never smokers, the researchers found.  The findings are to be presented Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6360637/It-takes-smokers-hearts-15-years-recover-quitting.html
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/health/fda-menthol-cigarettes-ban.html               F.D.A. Plans to Seek a Ban on Menthol Cigarettes    Image   As part of its campaign against flavored e-cigarettes and nicotine addiction, the Food and Drug Administration plans to seek a ban on sales of menthol cigarettes. It’s a measure long sought by health advocates, who said the products were marketed heavily to African-Americans.CreditCreditJeff Chiu/Associated Press  By Sheila Kaplan    Nov. 9, 2018    In a landmark move bound to further shake the tobacco industry, the Food and Drug Administration plans to propose a ban on menthol cigarettes next week as part of its aggressive campaign against flavored e-cigarettes and some tobacco products, agency officials said.  The proposal would have to go through the F.D.A. regulatory maze, and it could be several years before such a restriction took effect, especially if the major tobacco companies contest the agency’s authority to do so. None of the major tobacco companies would comment on the possibility of barring menthol cigarettes at this early stage.   But such a move has been long-awaited by public health advocates, who have been especially concerned about the high percentage of African-Americans who become addicted to menthol cigarettes.  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the agency’s commissioner, would not comment publicly on the proposal on Friday. But in a recent interview, he said the F.D.A. was revisiting the issue, one that had been weighed in previous administrations. “It was a mistake for the agency to back away on menthol,” he said earlier this fall.   Canada has already imposed a ban on menthol cigarettes, and the European Union’s ban is set to go into effect in 2020. Earlier this year, San Francisco passed a prohibition against the sales of menthol cigarettes and flavored e-cigarettes. The menthol proposal is just one of several initiatives the F.D.A. plans to announce sometime next week, including a ban on sales of most flavored e-cigarettes, except menthol and mint, at retail stores and gas stations across the country. The products, which include such flavors as chicken-and-waffles and mango, would be mainly relegated to sales online, at sites where the agency hopes to impose strict age verification to ensure that minors could not buy them.   As e-cigarettes became a booming business and extremely popular among teenagers and young people, health officials, parents and others became alarmed at the soaring use of nicotine-addicting products that were considered alternatives to traditional smoking for adults.    The F.D.A. began targeting the major manufacturers of e-cigarettes, focusing in particular on Juul Labs, the maker of a popular, flashy product that has become nearly ubiquitous in schools and on the streets.    Just a day after agency officials began issuing details of next week’s plan to ban some sales, Juul Labs indicated on Friday that it had decided to pull several of its wildly popular flavored e-cigarette pods off store shelves, according to several people briefed by the company. Editors’ Picks  What I Learned from Watching My iPad’s Slow Death   The Bright Future and Grim Death of a Privileged Hollywood Daughter China’s Women-Only Subway Cars, Where Men Rush In   The vaping giant will continue to sell its liquid nicotine pods in mint, menthol and tobacco flavors in brick-and-mortar stores, but will restrict other flavors that could be appealing to younger people to online sales. Juul Labs launched the device, which resembles a flash drive, in 2015, and now has about 77 percent of the United States e-cigarette market.    Last month, a competitor, Altria, said it would discontinue most of its flavored e-cigarettes and support federal legislation to raise the age of purchase to 21 for any tobacco and vaping product.    Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had been an advocate of such restrictions. “While more must be achieved to fully regulate e-cigs like actual cigarettes, Juul’s effort is a good step in snuffing out kid-friendly flavors that have fueled the spiking nicotine addiction amongst America’s youth and can make a difference,” Mr. Schumer said in an email.   Lisa David, president and chief executive of Public Health Solutions, a New York-based nonprofit group specializing in health issues for low-income and immigrant families, said she opposed keeping mint and menthol flavors easily available in stores, especially given the gateway effect for young people who start vaping and then move to traditional cigarettes.    “Menthol makes it seem less harsh, and also makes the body absorb more nicotine,” she said. “That means it’s easier to start smoking and harder to quit.”   Ms. David also wondered if Juul's restriction might be too late, because of the many similar devices, called “Juul-alikes,” already on the market.  Sign up for Science Times   We’ll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.  “Juul clearly was a contributor to the really significant uptake of young people using e-cigarettes,” Ms. David said. “At this point there are a bunch of other versions of the ‘Juul-alikes.’ They have similar shapes and flavors and are appealing to the same audience.”    The battle against menthol cigarettes has continued for decades.    According to the N.A.A.C.P.’s Youth Against Menthol campaign, about 85 percent of African-American smokers aged 12 and up smoke menthol cigarettes, compared with 29 percent of white smokers, which the organization calls a result of decades of culturally tailored tobacco company promotion.   The most popular menthol brand in the United States is Newport, which is the second-largest-selling cigarette brand in the industry, according to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Imperial Brands has two strong sellers, Kool and Salem. Altria’s best-selling cigarette, Marlboro, is also available in menthol, as is R.J.R.’s Camel.    A spokesman for R. J. Reynolds declined to comment. Altria and Imperial Brands could not be immediately reached.    In a joint statement on Friday, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Lung Association and several other public health groups said that action on menthol cigarettes was long overdue.   “There is overwhelming scientific evidence that menthol cigarettes have had a profound adverse effect on public health in the United States, resulting in more death and disease,” the organizations said.  Although federal health officials released new reports this week that indicated traditional smoking had reached a record low since 1965, smoking-related deaths still number about 480,000 in the United States every year.
Probably just a NOPE NOPE and a lot of you don't want that! ha! I am going to be around a lot of smokers on Saturday for a friend's 25th wedding anniversary party. I have drank and been around smokers but this is much more of a smoking crowd.  I WILL stay strong. I can breathe easy and can RUN! Guess i am just looking for more motivation. Outings like this still scare me :/

Here's my advice...don't be afraid! 1.  Look at it like a learning experience.  Watch them...watch how they get fidgety when they aren't smoking.  You will be fine during those moments because you aren't a smoker. Now that          is freedom!!    2.  Notice how they stink--YUK!!!   3.  Don't try to avoid them...if they all go out to smoke, don't be afraid to go with them.  It's not the smoking that socializes them....it's the socializing.  Believe me, they will be envious of you        for being so strong.    4.  Unless someone seriously wants to talk about how you quit smoking..(send them here) I would avoid talking too much about it.  Just because I feel smokers like to protect themselves            and they aren't ready to hear it.   5.  Dance your butt off!  Because you can   and you won't be huffing and puffing like your friends6.  Smoking isn't even an option for you...so, have a wonderful time and enjoy your first party with the smoking crowd...after that it will be easy peasy whenever you are in their company          again.

This is great news!                  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/08/cdc-says-smoking-rates-fall-to-record-low-in-us.html                           CDC says smoking rates fall to record low in US     An estimated 14 percent of adults, or 34.3 million people, smoked cigarettes in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In 1965, 42.4 percent of adults smoked cigarettes, according to the CDC.    E-cigarette use declined slightly between 2016 and 2017.    Angelica LaVito | @angelicalavito   Published 2 Hours Ago CNBC.com  Pascal Le Segretain | Getty Images  Cigarette smoking has fallen to its lowest point in recorded history, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    An estimated 14 percent of adults in the U.S., or 34.3 million people, smoked cigarettes in 2017, down from 15.5 percent in 2016, according to the CDC. This historic low represents a 67 percent decline from 1965, when the National Health Interview Survey started tracking the figure and 42.4 percent of adults smoked cigarettes.    The new data highlight how successful public health efforts have been over the past few decades. But it also shows that while concentrating on cigarettes has largely paid off, about 47 million people are still using some type of tobacco product.   "The declines we saw in 2017 for adult smoking are certainly unprecedented," said Brian King, a deputy director in the CDC's office on smoking and health, while cautioning against considering the data an overall public health win.  Initiatives like raising the price of tobacco, educating consumers on the dangers of smoking and efforts to help people quit are the primary drivers behind the decline, said King. Fewer young people are starting to smoke, older smokers are dying and others are quitting, he said. When adding other categories, including e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, 16.2 percent of adults, or 47 million people, used tobacco products of some kind in 2017, according to the CDC. Cigars, cigarillos or filtered little cigars were the second-most used product behind cigarettes, with 3.8 percent of adults, or 9.3 million people, saying they used them. Nearly 4 percent of adults use two or more tobacco products, with cigarettes and e-cigarettes representing the most common combination. It's unclear whether people are initially using both as part of the process to switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, but officials warn that people must fully switch in order to cut smoking risks.  Juul, the most popular e-cigarette on the market, was created to help smokers switch from cigarettes. While some adults are using the Juul devices to do just that, anecdotal evidence suggests many teens are also using the devices. Preliminary federal data show a 77 percent surge in high school students using e-cigarettes, figures that have prompted the Food and Drug Administration to label this an "epidemic."    The agency ordered five manufacturers — Juul, British American Tobacco's Vuse, Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Brands' Blu E-cigs and Japan Tobacco's Logic — to submit plans within 60 days on reducing teen use. The five companies represent about 97 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to the FDA.    Among adults, 2.8 percent used e-cigarettes last year, according to the CDC, down slightly from 3.2 percent in 2016. King cautions that this survey may not have captured how many adults are using Juul because the trend picked up in the later half of 2017 and the survey was conducted on a monthly basis. He also worries that young adults are using these products more than older demographics even though they're less likely to smoke conventional cigarettes. For adults ages 18 to 24, 5.2 percent used e-cigarettes and 10.4 percent smoked cigarettes last year, according to the CDC.   "If e-cigarette use was responsible [for declines in cigarette use], you would expect to see a perfect correlation, but that's not what we're seeing," he said. "If anything, e-cigarettes have complicated the tobacco product landscape."
Well I have been away for a  little bit, so time for a bit of a story.      Starting with the title and no Memories doesn't refer to the Elaine Paige song. Sorry Cats fans! And it is not even about the way we were.      Although first of all, maybe time to think back. Just how many of the tens or hundreds of thousands of cigarettes over the years were memorable for you? It may be that there are a few, but I bet it was more about the event you associate it with rather than the cigarette itself. I can't think of any myself.     Three months into my quit, when it wasn't really completely solid, I made the decision to commit my money to a charity trek in The Grand Canyon and Zion National Park. Having just got back from it, I can tell you now it was the best decision I ever made. I've been a lot more open to jumping in and attending events with others since I quit and it led on to this trek. What a time!       After the memorable journey for all the wrong reasons, 27 hours travelling is less than fun, I met up with 25 great people from a broad spectrum of the company I work at. It was truly the trip of a lifetime. From the moment we started hiking the South Rim of the Canyon, through to the two more challenging hikes the following days, the scenary, the company and the achievement of completing together was like nothing I had ever experienced. If anything Zion National Park was even more incredible. All of this because I chose to invest my £10 a day elsewhere. Saz speaks passionately about the value of rewards and having completed this it is something I really get. There's a natural high that no substance can replicate that you get from being out in the sun, with friends, achieving great things in the moment, as well as delivering the sort of sponsorship that will make life defining memories for others less fortunate.       I could bang on about this for hours, but just to keep this simple for now, I know now I gave up nothing and gained everything. You can to, it doesn't all have to be spent on one big event, that's just what worked for me. Make sure you connect with the world and your true friends. That's the real reward.       A few pictures from the trip for those interested, but just to add the pictures don't do the true beauty of it justice.  https://flic.kr/s/aHsmuSgcq5Edited November 4, 2018 by Sslip
    Glad you had the time of your life  That part of the USA is awe inspiring to be sure. Very unique and the scenery is breathtaking. I recognize a few of the landmarks in your photos from having seen them myself. So, even more proof that quitting smoking and channeling your $$ elsewhere was the best decision you ever made! Congratulations.
    Great stuff, Shane.  I just started looking at the pics but so far, they look awesome.      Quitting smoking really improves your life in ways you never expected.       
    How freaking AWESOME!! Wonderful, beautiful and well deserved, friend! 
Great post Shane, glad you had a good time here  Edited November 5, 2018 by jillar
    I am so proud of you.... you not only rewarded yourself with an amazing experience but you rewarded yourself by giving back to others. All the training and preparation paid of, being smoke free definitely paid off.... and despite giving yourself the trip of a lifetime you did it all for a brilliant bloody charity. So sure you had fun, and you rewarded your quit efforts and savings by having an awesome life experience but you also gave to a charity. I am wrapped the trip was everything you hoped and more. The photos are frickin smashing thank you so much for sharing.
    So proud of you. The trip looks amazing and your commitment and determination are admirable. Great job! 
    So glad you had a great trip Shane. That is such an amazing area to visit. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, and the pictures are great. Good to see you back.
    What a achievement @Sslip.....and a trip of a life time......and for a great cause....I love stories like this...high five !!!  I was angry,this tablet wouldn't let me look at the fabulous pictures...grrrr.....
    So so proud of you my friend, being able to give without expecting anything in return, and enjoying that is a lost art.     You are an amazing person and that resonates in the work you do...the pics are amazing. One can almost feel the happiness and joy through them. Here's to more beautiful memories...
    Absolutely beautiful pics Shane, looks just awesome there, what a fantastic experience. So glad you had a great time.   Thanks for sharing with us.

    Thank you so much for sharing your trip, Shane. The canyons you visited are magnificent.    You and the whole crew look blissed out.    I remember that feeling visiting there, it was an experience unlike any other   and I was too awestruck to communicate  the feelings I had.
Yesterday was month 13 of quit. I have had NO tobacco nor nicotine, weed, or whatever. Yeah i am afraid if I smoked a doob, it would trigger something even though I have smoked it maybe 10 times or less in my life. The closest I have been to smoking since I quit is when someone is standing outside a store puffing away their lives.        Anyways, so a couple weekends ago my room mate and i were pulling into this restaurant and I got this weird impulse that said, "light up". Well I can't do that without a cig now can I? So just a brief crave that came and went. But then Sunday I was heading to my sister's apartment and then again, that impulse of "light up".       A few nights ago I had this dream that I was able to start again but didn't want more than two or three cigarettes a week. Like I was in control of it. Side note about that - I work with this guy that used to chew and says he has dreams about chewing. F*****g nicotine won't leave ANY addict alone in dreams will it? He quit using it a while back but anyways.     So I am now thinking, just how much longer will I be dealing with this? The craves are not powerful but I want them gone. How the hell can the brain be so addicted to something so bad?
    Sorry that some triggers are still there and I have no advice to offer being a little way behind you. It is stunning that you have a quit that is strong despite these memories and addict prompts, you have already done an amazing job. I hope this is simply the last of the fading memories giving it one last try to get you to celebrate inappropriately.     Keep rocking the quit and showing us how it is done!
^^ What he said....     But your brain still has more smoking memories than quit memories. I know, like me, you have often wondered at those who get through that first year and relapse in month 13, 14, 15.... it probably just like you have experienced... maybe subconsciously we associate the 12 months as the job being done and it gives the addiction a chance to weedle back in... its about being ever vigilant.        I am sorry you have had a rough few days... but compare these passing thoughts that you know for what they are to what you went through in the third month. I am sure they are more frustrating than actually real chances of tossing your quit. You have a few coming behind you who need you to hang on... cos no pressure at all  .... I know your quit is strong, this is a little bump... use it as the reminder that the addiction will always be there weaker and weaker each day, month and year... but every now and then, when we feel all comfy that its a done deal its going to try and hook us back in... that just what being an addict is all about. Knowing that that is what it is gives you the power to laugh in its face and move on....       and because I never get to do one.... WooHoo Happy 13th month smoke free....
    Everyone is different JB...time...and everyone time is different ....   You will still  think of cigarettes ..even I do...but not as a crave ..it's just a thought ..like a million others i have in a day...   Your going great ......as long as you dont turn it into something else ..and smoke ...it's normal..
Good job Jet Black      I am only 19 hours smoke free
    Hey JB! I'm just a little ahead of you in time at a year and a half or so and I still have thoughts, bordering on weak cravings for a smoke here and there. They are fleeting thoughts but they are strong enough still that when they do come, it's surprising and if I was in a weak moment and like you noted, if I actually had a cigarette handy, I might light up just on a whim. That's why we always have to be on our guard and aware that it CAN happen if we were to get careless. We see people coming back here after a year or more quit for this very reason. They dropped their guard just one time and fell for that sinister thought .... Surely I can have just one!     Now just to put this in perspective for those behind us in their quits, these craves or thoughts of smoking are not in the same category as those we experience during our first months or even year of our quit. These thoughts of smoking or suggestions from deep in our mind that we should be lighting up are pretty weak and last only seconds and, they are not coming frequently which is what makes them dangerous. We aren't expecting them and most days we have no thoughts or urges to smoke. They come out of nowhere. I can't even identify a trigger when they come upon me. I will be just going about a normal everyday routine and one just comes into my head from nowhere. It's weird. But I do figure that these too will continue to get more and more infrequent as time goes by. Just like the rest of our quit though, progress is so gradual we don't notice it happening - it just does. That's it folks; time! It all just takes time so our job, once our quits are well established, is just to remain on guard and to be sure we aren't one of those coming back here after a year or so with our tails between our legs and starting this whole process over again.
I'd be 9 years quit on feb 10 if i didn't blow a long quit, its addiction. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction          I still pop around, from here to other groups. Its a demon we all have. Understand that's what it is.. I don't know if you know who Mike piano is but he'd call himself an alcoholic that was sober X years (a long time)...

    Well JB you are right it is getting old and we have to be on guard, and remember focus on what is NEW again!!!!

How the hell can the brain be so addicted to something so bad?                Craves are thoughts.  Nothing more.  They come and go.      We don't act on every thought that we have.  Most of us would be dead or in prison if we did.       Smoking thoughts are no different than the thousands of other thoughts that pass through our mind everyday.  They are only an issue if you act on them.     Don't fear random thoughts.
Hey Jet,    We don’t smoke. That’s the end of that.      13 months is amazing.      Personally I don’t think thoughts of smoking ever go away. We just get used to them and how to deal with them in our own way.  Addiction is addiction.  Not sure if I’ve ever mentioned this but I went through a stent in my early to mid 20s with hard drugs and I still think about it around this time of year. I’m 53. Cigarettes do nothing for us. They take away our time, our money and our health.
    Sometimes I think we have to quit each association separately.      You probably got it worked out that you don't smoke while driving or eating or working and everything is just fine until you, say, enroll in a college class and are walking on campus and that craving hits because you always smoked while in college and...your now in college.          Spend enough time on the campus NOT smoking and the cravings will go away right up until you are studying late at night and you always smoked when you study late at night so....       Anyhow, we have to work through these associations by dissociating smoking with what we previously did smoking.  That or do completely different things as non smokers.  Its a pain but we get well practiced ignoring cravings.  The occasional momentary discomfort beats being on a ventilator.                       
Remember, remember the 5th of November  The Gunpowder treason and plot, I can see of no reason  Why the Gunpowder Treason   Should ever be forgot.          Bonfire night... is the perfect time to hold a Quit Train bonfire... so let me start it off with my 8,783 cigarettes that I have not smoked... burn little coffin nails, burn!

I don't envy you Foe as those first days are not something I think back fondly on but, as you know. you gotta go through those to get to the more manageable days. Congrats on finishing day 1!

    Good job Foe, have a good sleep 
Congrats on making it through Day 1, Foe.  Just take it one day at a time and you can do it.
    One day at time, one day at a time Foe.  Great job on the first day -- keep it going~!!!
    High five first day done!! Don't make yourself crazy if you can't sleep well...use your distractions and sleep when you can.    See you tomorrow!!
    To help you along your journey ,you need to make sure your toolbox is full of tools here are some tools.    Allen Carr the Easy book..this book has helped millions...  Deep breathing excersises   Regula's chewing gum    I had my I pod...sang my head off....   My punching pillow....  Boiled sweets.  Joel's video,s....  More idea ,s quit train...what,s in your toolbox ...
    They need a plan in that tool box, exercise... A dumbbell , deep breathing... I needed that mechanical crutch and cut a straw. Watching videos on youtube about cigg smoking also helped... Here is a pic of a starter kit   
I'll share the tools I use/d :   app to track days not smoked and money saved - still usepharmacy weekly support - used for around 3 weekspatches and lozenges - used for 3 weeksstop smoking forum - still usefriends, I get support and encouragement from both my smoking and non smoking pals - still use (pals are great huh)   exercise, sleep and food for sure got me through my quit. I had lots of early nights early in my quit.         Reading, reading and then reading some more about quitting, the benefits of quitting etc really drum it into your head.         I dinny avoid booze so was still able to enjoy myself while quitting. I know that's a bone of contention for some folk here but it worked well for me. On that note I think it's time for a whisky          I didn't read Allen Carr this time round but I still retain some of it from a previous quit so defo worth a read if you haven't already. Or a re read.

A ﻿dumbbell﻿ ﻿  and how are they supposed to fit you in the box?! (I kid, I kid)        Seriously tho, chocolate and positive self talk...change your mindset from  quitting, to "I'm WINNING!!"    Get over hype words too...it gives it too much power. Cravings, triggers, nicodemon...it's just memories from nicotine receptors.   That leads to educate yourself!! A good educated quit doesn't just fall in your lap; you have to look for it. Google everything. I started with "how nicotine changes my mind and body" and went from there.    Reward yourself daily...kiss your spouse longer, hug your kids tighter...feel good about taking your life back!!

    I was on the forum everyday, practically all day! Supporting others and reading posts really helped me keep my mind off my misery.  Playing games and socializing also helped tons  My JAC (jillars air cigarette). Used it for months and loved looking like an idiot smoking an invisible cigarette   Lots of candy and candy. And then some more candy

    There was the guy that said he would bark/growl...I took from that and would make this crazy guttural bellowing sound to "pump myself up" before I would go into a store or where ever...because as a smoker with "aniexty" (<--I learned this was a nicotine lie as well)  I would "need" to smoke before I went inside anywhere.

I'm a newbie and I loved the quit tool box idea when it was mentioned. It is full to the brim.      Sweets of every variety ie soft caramel toffees (these are amazing), mints, chocolate (I mean like 30 bars), parma violets, liquorice, foamy bananas and rice krispie squares       Puzzle books        Stress balls (I'm surprised they haven't burst yet)     A copy of Oasis song stop crying your heart out (I play this when I feel down and it makes me feel worst )      A notebook to write all my thoughts in      3000 bags of Marmite crisps (it's a big box)        Tissues and my bottle of aromatherapy oil       A ball of wool and needles (not used yet as can't knit)     A jigsaw puzzle         Relaxation CD       My empty charm bracelet                              Edited November 3, 2018 by LillySpelling

Two birds with...              I became obsessive about health and fitness after I quit.  It helped on several fronts.     Between working out and reading books and articles about exercise and nutrition, it didn't leave much time to think about wanting a cigarette.      My tendency towards becoming a hyper-focused geek when I take up something new actually played in my favor on this one.
So people.... we all know quitting can be hard... but it can be fun too... you get to meet new people, you get to laugh at sticks, you get to discover hiding internet research skills.... so regardless of if you are 1 day, 1 month, 1 year or 10 years (or more) quit there has to be at least one funny moment from your quit that even now when you think about it you laugh... it may be something someone posted.... it may be the way you responded to a crave and how silly it was in hindsight.... me I have a million to choose from, this Quit is littered with fun, funny and happy memories.... sure there is some yuck in there... but why waste energy focusing on the bad stuff lets shine a light on the good....     Its so hard to choose... there was the time I had a break down and stomped around the house ranting and raving about 1% and not statistic telling me I wont be successful.. when I typed that post I was so angry I am sure I sprained the tips of my fingers I was thumping the words out so hard. Now hysterical, wish someone had of video taped the crazy woman.... at the time nope.... but I am surprised the people in my house didn't call the folks with the straight jackets.... hahahaha... so funny now.        Then there was the time I sat at the door rocking back and forth because I really wanted a coffee and I couldn't have one because I had to have nil by mouth for a medical test and Junky me was claiming smokes were nil by mouth so they were acceptable.... all night long.... now, at 11 months quit... that's funny... at the time, NOPE... it was a really close call.        Or there are hours of answer a question with a question where I had tears running down my face... explaining my Pineapple experiment to Barry.... and seriously Who is Shane????? so many laughs....        Oh there are the hours of comedians I watched on youtube.... hours of them...best crave beater was laughter...
Hard to chose for me too. I think one of the funniest moments when I was in my first year was the Humor thread that @Hope2Nope talked about not long ago. We somehow started talking about gas and I was telling everyone my hubbys theory of what makes a stinky fart. Awww, good times lol.   Unfortunately that was one thread I was unable to bring over Another funny one by far is the ask a stupid question thread, some of those answers brought tears to my eyes!Great post jo
    Aye the night we were posting all the pineapple pictures in ask a question I was in stitches!! 
    Did Barry ever work out who Shane was?       
    I remember the fart conversation jillar let me think while I get the kids ready for school...       Thanks Jo
    I have to say watching the new stick of the day each day to see just what it would be was often pretty funny.... and then it blew up with the funniest sticks and comments ever.... I have one word for you all.... MEGADONG...... hahahahahaha

MEGADONG......﻿﻿   God, @Doreensfree never ending garden good times in stick alley...  (Don't go there much anymore tho, got weird, stickless and making fun of obese people which is not my bag at. all.)     My personal funny is when I first quit and my husband made a big deal about quitting too, but he "needed" nicorette to use at work. Well, he kept leaving his pack of cigarettes in his pants or on the headboard and it just wore me out that he thought he could keep up this charade.    One day, I had to use his truck (he keeps his stash in the door panel) and there was like 3 packs in there...like 4 in one pack, 10 in another and a full one...and quite coincidentally a FULL unopened nicorette package. I dumped all the cigarettes in the console and put sections of the gum in each empty cigarette pack and put them back in the door panel.    Well, he finally "had to run to the store"...you guys know the drill...when he came home, he was chomping gums and pissy. Oh, man I loved it.   The whole day he stomped and slammed and bit*hed...finally I asked him "Did you even look in the console?"  I'd never seen him move that fast!  Never found another pack of cigarettes in the house again tho!!
    And, you would think he would learn from putting them in the door panel, but nooooo...one night we were on the porch, having a couple of drinks, enjoying the coolness of the on-coming rain when it came a bad storm; hail, lightning, the works.  So, being hill billys, we just moved the party into the truck so we could listen to some music and still enjoy the rain.    This guy leaves his door open during the storm and we're a little buzzed so didn't think anything of it.    The next morning he brings in a mostly full pack that's disintegrating from the flooded door panel  I just laughed and told him "That's your sign!" He quit that day and from what I know hasn't had one since.

    I bought myself a First Class ticket on the Quit Train and am looking forward to the ride.      It's taken me longer than I expected to board but took Jillars advice and waited until I was really ready.      So here I am and I'm feeling really positive and happy that I no longer smoke

Nice of you both to check on me.        Love that picture Jane.     I'm fighting my way through and only 3.5 hours away from completing the first day. It helped that I have had to sort my car out today. It meant a lot of time sitting around in the garage but every time the door opened and I felt the cold I was glad I wasn't having to go out there every half an hour to get my fix.      I don't have any energy which is a bit annoying but might hide out in bed tonight.
    Congratulations on your fast approaching end of day one Lilly.
    Thanks Joe. I'm celebrating by attempting to make cheese straws. I'm soooo rock and roll

    One of the things that got me through the first couple of weeks was getting even.  The tobacco companies take from you - your money, your time, your time on Earth, your natural scent, your clean fingers and lungs, your very breath.   Take from them.  Never buy another nicotine product again and make them hurt.  Feels good to inflict a little pain to your adversaries, doesn't it!       How much money are you NOT going to give them today?        Best wishes. You can do it.  Any way you can.       Chris
    Watching the money saved grow is my new addiction Chris 
From 12 O clock tonight ...smokers will have to pay 33 pence extra for a packet of cigarettes....   Due to the budget ...   Lurkers !!!!.......jump on the train now and quit !!!.....save yourself a fortune...Give yourself a pay rise instantly.....and get healthier too....
Yes lurkers, as you peruse the various posts take a look at our members tickers. The amount of money saved and cigarettes not smoked will astonish you. It still does me!Edited October 29, 2018 by jillar

Ok... so Down Under is not the place to smoke...        1 pack (Marlboro) is $34.00AUS ... which is:        £ 19        US$ 24      € 21        Can$ 31     Indian Rupee Rs 1,746       DKK kr156       It goes up periodically and by 2020 it will be $40 per pack. More than 250% of this price is tax which is supposed to go to the health budget and to education. It is a program called prohibitive pricing designed to make people quit. So any Aussie lurkers out there or any over seas people thinking of moving down under... quit now before it sends you broke or kills you... both are likely if you live in Aus.
Wow £ 19 ...I don't know how anyone in Oz can afford to smoke ..well that's one incentive to Keep The Quit ...

When i quit it was 10-11 per pack i was a pack a day. Over 300 a month i saved, Manhattan is over priced on SI 14-15 per pack roughly USD. My car lease payment i saved + what insurance cost me per month.

I just looked on-line for my state, Virginia (US).   The average price here is $4.69 per pack.   That's not much more than what it was when I quit almost 2.5 years ago.  I think it was $4.30 or so when I quit.       According to the table I saw, Virginia is the 3rd lowest in the US in terms of cost per pack.    Edited October 30, 2018 by Wayne045
I just looked on line for the brand I used to smoke.... £9.54 a packet (20) now  I smoked 20 a day, so it would be costing me nearly £70 a week now!!!!!   what a pay rise to myself
Health Canada is looking at requiring cigarette makers to print health warnings on each cigarette. If passed, this will be a first. I bet the tobacco industry won't like that! Lots of logistic and cost issues  Probably drive the cost of smokes sky high in Canada as well. They are only about $15.00 for a pack of 25 at the moment.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-health-canada-considering-warning-labels-on-individual-cigarettes/

I actually thing this is an awesome idea.
No amount of pictures or health warnings will deter smokers. After the first time you look at them you stop even noticing them.         Nobody I know has ever quit smoking because of the packaging. It's usually pregnancy, health, cost or they just didn't want to do it any longer.        I'm proud I've quit smoking but I still believe it should be a choice. Edited October 30, 2018 by LillySpelling

Your cost is for the equivalent of two of our packs so you don't pay much more than us in reality.

After the first time you look at them you stop even noticing them.                                         Nobody I know has ever quit smoking because of the packaging. It's usually pregnancy, health, cost or they just didn't want to do it any longer.                                        I'm proud I've quit smoking but I still believe it should be a choice.          I agree that pictures and words alone won't by itself convince someone to quit but, it's all part of making the choice to smoke more uncomfortable and the repetition of those images does have some effect on the smoker, whether one wants to admit it or not. Also, friends and family see the images and ask the smoker uncomfortable questions about their "habit". Chipping away at the smokers belief that THEY are the special one that won't get cancer or die minus a couple of limbs or die of a stroke or hear attack is what these negative smoking messages are all about. It's like a leaky tap - drip, drip, drip. Pretty soon, you can't ignore it. Smokers always have a choice to smoke if the want to. No one is taking that away, just making it more and more socially uncomfortable to continue to make that choice.     And yes Jo, that's what smokers are complaining about here. Smokers interviewed on the news were all up-in-arms that the government was going to make them smoke ink printed on the cigarette tubes. Now THAT would be unhealthy!Edited October 31, 2018 by reciprocity

I'm seriously militant anti-smoking since I quit so I'm even all for taking them out of stores completely and smokers have to go to a separate place to get them. Stinky butt suckers.

It said 2001 so it took me 17 years from then to quit smoking. That is why I say the impact of warnings is ignored by most. We say this is an addiction and realistically addicts don't listen to reason, they don't care as long as they get their fix.       I'm more in favour of education because as is said here regularly education is key.         If you took two sets of 100 smokers and gave the first 100 people cigarettes with a warning message on, then took the second set of 100 people round a cancer ward I'm pretty sure the second group would have more immediate quitters. Even then they would forget what they saw quite quickly as the addict in them would take over. Most of us have watched our loved ones die from smoking and then chain smoked while grieving.        I'm not saying either one of our views is right or wrong. I just hope more people stumble across sites like this because success somewhere like here is much higher than any warning on a cigarette packet.
    ^^^ I agree with what you say Lilly  When I was a smoker I scoffed at the horrid pictures on cigarette packs. You can put anything on there you like but you will not deny me my smokes! That was my attitude also but, now that I am on the other side of the issue, I would rather have them legislate anything that will make it more clear to smokers that this is not only dangerous to themselves but it's socially unacceptable now as well in most places. Beyond that what can be done? I don't believe in making them illegal. That doesn't work.      I guess what I am hoping is that these little things might in some cases bring people to sites like this one a little sooner.
    My friend started to put black tape around each packet ,when I asked ,Why ...she said so she doesn't have to look at all the horrible pictures..    If that was enough ...she then went in to the shop and asked for packets with one certain picture...and not the others...   The shop retailer had to go through them ,till he found the right pack...it was a local shop ,so she knew him...otherwise I don't think she would have been able to do this...  The lengths smokers will go ...

    There are also fancy box covers. Yep, guilty. Had a flamingo one        i always have doubs with those warnings etc. from experience, if people don’t want to quit they won’t, regardless of all the pictures. On the other hand, one can’t just not do anything and just sit and watch.

There's a guy that kicks up a stink and demands to see all the packets until he finds one that he's comfortable with..  Then you have the smoker that demands to know how much tar and nicotine is in the pack they want..  only, it doesn't tell you anymore..!!  Lots of packs have went up by  around 70p for budget but highest increase is a whopping £1.20 .. so that's 12 or 13 pounds a pack.. !!
    Some will never quit no matter what but, at least things are going in the right direction in terms of telling people the truth about nicotine addiction and the related risks!

Well I lost my elderly friend this morning.  Tough stuff.  I so loved this lady and the time I spent with her.  There will definitely be a huge void in my life.    I will admit that death and smoking is hard.  Smoking was a huge part of the very low moments in our life.  It is almost automatic to want to reach for that comfort.   As a smoker, there are times in our lives that the smoking; not the people gave us the companionship that we needed.    This definitely was a test in my quit, but instead of giving in, it helped me realize the connection that I often isolated myself when I was hurting and I smoked to ease the pain of the   hurt.   I came through okay.  I am really experiencing the emotions of the loss and crying! Am posting a picture of my friend and I on her 103rd birthday.  She almost made it to her 104th in January!
    I'm so sorry Linda, RIP to your friend .
Ahhw Linda. My condolences on the loss of your dear, dear friend. What a great picture of you both.         Smoking is isolation, that is a key discovery..     Whishing you good things, dwell in warm memoires. Please take care these coming days. X      Edited October 31, 2018 by MLMR

    Oh, my dear, Linda,     what a sad, sad day for you.    I am so sorry.  This photograph of you and your friend is beautiful and indicative of your very special relationship.

    How beautiful y'all are!!       I'm so happy for you that in these moments you can recognize the chains smoking had on you and that you are now free! Live in these emotions, enjoy the feeling of them!    Sending my love your way, friend...take some time to just breathe
    My condolences, Linda, on the loss of your lovely friend! Glad you got to be there for her at the end....RIP, Linda's lovely friend!
    Very sorry to hear this Linda 
    I'm so sorry to hear this, Linda.
    Thanks so much for the condolences.  I am so fortunate to have found your friendships at this time of my life.      It truly helps to have you all to reach out to.  Thanks so much for being there.
    Linda, my deepest condolences to you.  You have exhibited great strength, empathy and courage -- thank you for showing the way.  I am sure your friend was thankful and proud.  You have made it through one of the toughest times for quitting and you have come thru strong.  Prayers are with you!!!!
    Condolences Linda for your loss. Memories of great companionship will live on forever in you.   You and your friend were blessed with this relationship and lived it to the fullest. That's among the best life has to offer  
    Linda, I'm so sorry for the loss of your beautiful friend.  What a wonderful and rare relationship you had, and I hope you can always cherish the reciprocal comfort, companionship, and joy, you gave to each other.   
    I’m sorry to read about the passing of your dear friend. She looks like a fun gal to pal around with; her frames are awesome!       I’m glad you turned to us for comfort rather than those stinky “friends” we  have all expelled from our lives.      As you grieve, please be sure to find some quiet moments to take care of yourself. 
    Deepest condolences for the passing of your dear friend. Remember while she may be gone she is not lost, she is with you everyday in the part of your heart and soul she made her own. I know now the memories are too new and too raw but in time you will be able to remember the laughter and joy you shared.        True friendships, that breach the generation gaps, are a rare and precious thing that give so much to both. You have been truly blessed to have this lovely lady in your life, just as she was truly blessed to have you by her side in her twilight.       Know that when you look to the sky on cold day and a tendril of warm light breaks through the clouds and shines on your face, that is your friend reminding you of her love.        So very, very proud of you for holding true to your NOPE. It is such a hard thing to endure and you are so right, for years we hid from our emotions behind a cloud of smoke.... but now we are strong, and we don't need that. To move forward and grow we need to feel it all, not just the joy and happiness but also the sadness, horror and heartbreak. You can walk through this forest of darkness, you might get a few scratches and bruises but you will come out the other side and you will be stronger as a person and as a non-smoker.... because you Linda Thomas are an awesome woman with the stregth and power to achieve anything you put your mind to.
    So sorry, Linda. Sending hugs and condolences. 
    Sorry for your loss Linda. Thoughts are with you. Very impressive you kept your quit. A real test. 
    My thoughts are with you Linda x
    So sorry to hear about your loss Linda. Sending hugs and prayers.   Shows true grit that you didn't smoke...I know what a tough time this is.   But you had a lovely relationship with her, and I'm sure you have some amazing memories.     
AMAZING!!! I don't know what it is but the past couple of days I've felt great.  The craves have not been super intense and I have not been as irritable as I was the first couple of weeks. I've been really on my toes with this quit, like on edge 24/7.... always in a state of mind trying to tell myself not to smoke, not to give in. But the past couple of days I haven't felt on edge or like I could lose my quit at any moment. I feel good about my quit. And I keep reminding myself about the honey moon phase, and to not get too comfortable... but man am I enjoying this all natural high I'm feeling at the moment.
    Great positive post @I Got This (T)...great to hear you are feeling comfortable in your quit....stay on your guard...!!!!
    That's awesome!! Love it, embrace it, take it out to dinner!! Glad you're feeling good (T)...gold stars for you!
    That is so awesome T.  Once I got through the first month, I have had no urges to look back on that part of my life. So have confidence in you quit.  You will continue to get stronger and feel so much better about yourself!
    Hope the positive feelings continue for ya IGT!  Feeling great and in a positive way is the best  
    Hey IGT, amazing post, thanks for sharing. Long may it continue      
    Attitude can change everything.
Keep going - it gets so much better !!!     Not all days will be like today, but you will have more and more great days, and less and less bad days.        This is a promise !!!       Do you see the smile on my face ??? That shows perfectly how much I love life as a non-smoker.              CristóbalEdited October 31, 2018 by Cristóbal

    A quiz, a nice way to do some more rewiring (the explanation to given answers is education in itself) and at the same time to test your susceptibility to all of the Whyquit material ;-). Some questions are obviously a bit tame, but hey, we can't brainwash ourselves enough with all this knowledge!    Why Quit Smoking Quiz               
92%, not bad...got a couple of the NRT ones wrong (precentages questions) and #28 answer G. was the right answer but it was blank so I picked every other one first.    Good stuff tho; always learning
    Some of their information is wrong.  It takes longer for Nicotine to leave the body.  
98%... but I read Jane's post ^^ there first so I knew #28 was the blank G... so I kinda cheated.... we all know I knew the 1% question on NRT gum... LOL... remember that break down.... and pledge.
I got 87% but I take issue with a few of the statistics....

    That mustache is gross
** WARNING ** - I am about to talk about the death of friends and loved ones so if this is a sensitive issue for you please don't read.     I was Quit 26 days... and struggling with the quit, that third week had been hell on earth. It felt like every other minute I was fighting the urge to light up. There were two voices in my head Notsmokin Jo (NSJ) who does not smoke and Smokin' Jo (SJ) who does and boy was that Smokin' Jo loud and persistent about being heard and fed her addiction... and then at 10.30pm on day 26 my phone rang... and I dropped everything and went to my friends place... her husband had gone for a drive with his brother 3 hours early and not come home.... the internet was full of news of a horrific accident in our area..... the footage looked like it might be the car.... so while we went to the police station and my daughter stayed with her besty and her grandparents and we went to the cop shop.... the whole time SJ is in my head... "OMG this is serious shit, you can't do this you need a smoke. Like now. If you smoke you will be able to focus on what you need to do... you are such a selfish friend, how can you help if your don't have a smoke to calm the f down... enough of this quit bullshit, you need to get your act together and have a smoke then sort this stuff... you can't help if you don't smoke" ...on and on it droned along the same theme... I heard it as I sat on the floor of the cop shop cradling my friend who had collapsed.... I heard it as I drove her home.... I heard it as we sat at the table and she chain smoked and we watched my daughter hold her daughter in her arms and rock themselves to sleep... I heard it as we realised her lovely, smiley, beautiful husband was not going to come through the door any minute and laugh at us for being so silly.... I heard it as I pried his half melted keys from her hand... and as I washed and dressed her hand where the jagged edges had dug in because she was squeezing them so tight... and as I waited for the girls to fall asleep and then put out her kids chrissy presents because she couldn't go into her bedroom.... as I drove home and got my kid's pressies from Santa and put them out at her house.... as I watched her four year old ask again and again when daddy was coming home... as I watched her throw her laptop across the room so she did have to read the filth and vitriol of internet heroes trashing her dead husbands name..... as I said goodbye and drove my daughter to her dads, then my dads, then back to her dad's..... as I missed my family christmas to drive to the airport to get her mum... and drove home with her mum chain smoking in the car re-living the night before the whole time.... holding my baby while she wailed at life being unfair and how could this happen and why her friends and then after she ignored me and looked it up on the internet why people were saying horrible things about him and then the day she really broke, the day someone told her he was still alive and banging on the window as the car burnt and she had watched the footage on the internet of the car burning....and the months of nightmares..... SJ begged and pleaded and wheedled... "go on have one, just one, you know you want it, you need it".... and every time I fought the urge because that was the only thing I could control.... then on the morning of my one month anniversary the phone rings.... my uncle overseas, the oldest, has fallen and hit his head and is a coma.... so I had to watch my dad contemplate the first of his siblings to die since he was an adult... and know he couldn't for health reasons fly over.... every phone call... he is getting better.... he is worse..... come now.... every call that awful, whiny voice was begging me to smoke... but I held out... one New Years Day when the phone rang and he was gone.... watching my dad shut down... watching his other siblings who couldn't go fall apart or turn into agro nutcases.... it was just too much... but I fought the urge... and I kept my quit. It was hard, it was a battle, and truthfully it was a close call. These were real craves, not just passing thoughts... these involved sweat and determination to beat.... because my brain had been programmed that when the shit hits the fan you have a smoke (or 3) and then deal.... but I had none... I sat surrounded by smokers and did not have one... I did not increase the number of NRT I was having... if anything I decreased it.... but it was hard and for 3 weeks it felt constant. But I was not going to cave because it was the one thing in a time of chaos I had control over. I think the whole second month of my quit was one big, long, agonising crave... constantly, all day, go on, go on, go on, go on, every waking moment and if you were around the first 5 months of my quit you knew there was a hell of a lot of waking moments... on average there were 20 of those in a day..... but I fought every single one of them and I don't even really know why.... wait yes I do... it was the only thing I could control.      Then yesterday morning I get a phone call... and I just knew it was bad.... so my little cousin (35) had died of an overdose. I don't know yet if it was deliberate or accidental. But he didn't deserve to go out that way.... no one does... well maybe the real scum of the earth... but he gave back, he cared for his mum... drove over 3 hours each way every couple of days to check up on her or have dinner with her or make sure she was doing ok... he spent his weekends with her most of the time... he had been clean for years.... it just doesn't make sense.... but what did I do... I went about doing a load of washing and going to softball and cooking tea and chatting on here and doing a painting and going to sleep and going to a party and then I left the party and headed home and I lost it... bawled like a baby all the way home from the farm, I dunno how I even saw to drive my eyes were so red and swollen when I got home.... and the whole time my baby sat next to me and didn't know what to do.... she said the silent tears were the worst... but do you want to know what I didn't do? I did not fight a crave.... not one..... not once did I even get an inclining to have a smoke... not one smoking related thought at all.... HOW COULD THIS BE???????... earlier in the year I had faced a constant barrage.... like bullets from a machine gun those craves pummeled me...  sure it was much earlier in my quit.... but nothing, not one single thought, whisper, suggestion for anything smoking or nicotine related.      You see those of us who have been on the quit train for a while tell you rewards are important its all about re-wiring your brain and the nicotine receptors.... teaching your brain that smoking isn't how we reward ourselves or celebrate... in the same regards the reason the first year is so important is because we have to experience so many firsts without nicotine... season changes, holidays, stresses..... and we have to rewire our brains, rewire the triggers.... so why was there nothing this time.... its because the silver lining of the horror I ended and started this year with rewired every single receptor in my brain and trigger to do with dealing with death... all of them... so this time when the idea and concept of smoking and a nicotine fix didn't even exists... and so the silver lining of this horror is that I know how strong my quit is... I know I can face death and loss and not have to worry about facing my addiction at the same time because those receptors have all be erased and rewired to something else... a new inner strength, maybe? .... but I don't really care what it is because this is the final proof I needed that this time, this quit, this is the forever, sticky quit and while I'm only 11 months free.... I feel way beyond... whole, major sections of my brain don't even recognize nicotine's existence.... sure I'd rather still have my friend, and my uncle, and my cousin.... would probably even trade my quit for them to be here.... but giving up my quit wasn't going to bring them back or help me cope.... silver linings people... they are in any and every situation... mine in this instance are purely selfish.... but I would rather think that its the last gift these three amazing men gave me in their lifetimes... and I will treasure it always.       So newbies, and lurkers.... and the in-betweenies.... sometimes the re-wiring hurts, it cuts a deep raw wound straight through the center of your being... but those nicotine receptors do get rewired... so its up to you... are you going to do the work to re-wire... it starts with the rewards... oh yay I went an hour without a smoke... I'm going to eat this lovely strawberry / candy / celery stick.... whatever... but do something... every hour.... every two hours...every 12.... every day.....every week.... every milestone you pass.... because regardless of what shit life throws at you there is a nicotine receptor in your brain waiting to exploit it.... and you need to take the control back and re-wire those. Because it can be done.... it is done.... every day by the members here who travel this train.... get rid of the smokes and the vapes and start re-wiring.... you have the power within you to totally change your life and your brain... how fricking amazing is that!
    Great post Jo! You're absolutely right on the mark too!     Most, if not all of us, will be challenged by something going off the rails in life during the early stages of our quits. Yours was a number of extreme and unusual situations but your point being that sooner or later the resolve of our commitment will be put to the test and that's the moment that separates the men from the boys and the women from the girls. Just because we stopped smoking doesn't mean life stops for us but, it gives us the opportunity to prove to ourselves just how strong we can be when something is important enough to us.       I'm sorry for all your troubles Jo but I'm also glad you made it through those times smoke free. That will be a shining light for you forever. You will forever know you can do virtually anything           
    Nothing else to say...      Sometimes I can't be grateful enough that the universe has all of here at the same time.
    Such an inspirational post for everyone. Your strength and determination with so much sadness in your first year is amazing and I'm not sure I could have kept my quit with so much tragedy as you had/have to deal with. Thank you for sharing jo xoxo
    A beautiful honest post...  I am sorry to learn your life was full of sadness at the beginning of your quit..   You are a remarkable strong lady....it shows us ,just how much you were determined to kick this horrible addiction...   Your a inspiration....  Thank you for sharing this with the board...    Hoping it will give lurkers , just the help they needed...to take a seat...xxxx
    Jo, your story breaks my heart.  Your suffering has been insurmountable.  I so admire your courage and strength.  The fact that you did not cave during these difficult times shows how much determination you have.  You are an inspirational to us all.  I wish I could be there to just hold and comfort you. 
    So inspirational Jo... xx
"What if someone dies?"     As my addicted mind went into overdrive in the days before I quit, I asked myself that question.  My thinking at the time was, there are certain life events in which it is totally impossible to even consider not smoking.  The death of someone close to me was the big one, the clause that would give me full permission to continue feeding my addiction, but there were others.      Then I had to face reality.  In 2007 I watched my beloved grandfather die after a long battle with cancer.  In 2012, I lost my brother-in-law in a tragic accident.  During both of those times in my life I smoked one right after another.  All those cigarettes.  All that nicotine...didn't change a damn thing.  Someone I loved was gone.  The people in my life that mean the most to me were all hurting.  My heart was broken.     The cigarette offers us nothing.  Whether it's just another day or the worst day of your life, there is no comfort to be found in a pack of cigarettes.

This April ..I lost my life long companion.... The best friend anyone could ever wish for....   We are together every day....for 62 or more years....   I am numb....I still expect her to walk through my door ... She died of a smoking related illness.... It hurts to know I can help people here quit ...but not my best friend....    She still believed cigerettes offered her something...  It took cancer 12 weeks to do its worse.... I never once considered a cigarette.... I have heard ,learned..seen ..that smoking would not change a dam thing.....
@DoreensfreeI love you lady 
    (((Hugs))) to you Jo, you are one strong amazing woman. I have always worried about the death of a loved one too, and thought that would be the one thing that would instantly make me smoke.   God forbid I never will experience what you have, and may God give me the strength to not smoke if I do.    x
Jo, now that's how you test a quit. My wife and I have lost her dad and my dad to lung cancer, and lost her mom, all in the last year to five years ago. DW has never quit. I never threw away my quit 5 years ago. I won't be smoking at her funeral but she'll be smoking at mine. It's a choice, and a matter of self control. That's all it is. GREAT Post!     KTQ

    Jo, you have a gift for writing, for expressing complicated feelings in fairly simple, raw terms -- but more importantly you have a wonderful capacity for empathy and humanity, which both seem to be in much shorter supply in this world every day.  Thank you for that, and for seeing the positives in the negatives, no matter how lopsided they may seem at times.

Seriously, have you ever thought about starting your own quit clinic?       Thanks so much for taking the time to write all of this down, Jo. The beauty is, it's very educating to others and at the same time I bet it plays a part in your own journey (heading towards one year, you go girl!). You have a lot to look back at.. darn. Do know your story is rediculously inspiring!

But your story is inspiring too and Linda's and Doreens and Jillars and Joe7s and Alberts and Sazeracs and G67 and Parsley and Jet Black and everyone single other person here.. we all face really awful things in our lives at times, I just lucked out and had a whole heap happen in my first year quit... but silver lining... I don't have to face them down the track... major health issues, work redundancy, betrayal, deaths, family issues....they are all things you could face at anytime... getting them over with in the first year is just like rapid detox. We are all traveling our own roads and we are all facing lifes challenges and our quits at the same time... but its important to know that when we say you are re-wiring your brain and the receptors it is so true...it really works. When things got dicey about if I would or wouldn't light up and there were moments I had my fellow travellers here to help me stay the course... I had the people I played games with over at qsmb to keep my mind occupied with things besides the drama and the craves.        For a few months I have been playing lip service to this is my sticky quit... but the weekend prooved it... I am quit, I am never going back NOPE is the only reality I know.

What an amazing inspirational post Jo, you're a strong, determined and awesome gal...super awesome actually.        And yes, we all are dealing with a lot of things but it takes courage and lucidity of thought to put this out here, and it inspires people. I keep having Triggers nowadays (not cravings) of smoking, and all I have to do is close my eyes and say a firm no, and poof, they vanish.  It's not easy saying no sometimes, but I remember why I said no in the first place. I don't want to ever again be a slave to this disgusting habit, I never want to stink till the high heavens, lose my breath climbing 2 flights of stairs (I still do, but that's because of my weight :p )Mainly, I don't want to feel compelled to act like a tripped out zombie if I don't get my "fix", be irritable, lurk in corners, hide that smoke when I see kids and elderly people (reflex action).    So thank you for sharing, makes me realize that I cannot let my mind use any instance in my life to lead me to light up a smoke. That's not happening, ever.
    Thank you, Jo.  You are a great inspiration to all  and help all of us keep our quit.   Thank you so much.  S
Great message, we all can stay quit under the meanest of circumstances,  because it's a choice and that's all it is. They blow smoke in our faces in any circumstance, we're quit for life,  lending some dignity and meaning to the concept of QUIT. How many have we had die in our personal lives and on this and the other board after quitting? We didn't go running off to smoke, too strong for that.  I know off at least 10 in my life but I'm old but it will come at you so be ready.  Doreen so very sad to read of your loss, I wish I had been around...      KTQ         Markus
    Thank you Markus ...    Have sent you a message ....xx
    Big magic.
I'm 9 months 21 days from my last puff. I smoked a pack a day for 34 years.  I did the work. You folks (and QSMB) were my crutch, my parole officer, my defense attorney and my Mom, but I did the work.        The Good        I haven't smoked. That statement still seems a bit unreal. I haven't smoked 8,251 cigarettes. That's a milestone that blows me away. I don't really crave very often. It doesn't seem like there are very many times when smoking is even part of my life anymore. I also have my first grandbaby and I'm really excited that i won't smoke and stink around her. No coughing anymore. I feel like I really didn't cough that much after I quit.        The Bad     Occasionally I put myself in familiar situations that have an unfamiliar feel to them. I played a gig in a room where people were smoking both cigarettes and pot (I live in Canada and it's now legal here). Trying to sing was a little rough with smoke in the air, it had been a long time since I played anywhere you could smoke inside.  I'm still not comfortable with all moments (family, work) and occasionally it crosses my mind that I am missing something. Also, at work occasionally my smoke break is interrupted by my not smoking.  I haven't really had much in the way of giant improvements in my health. I think I breath a little easier.      The Ugly        I have a little blockage in the airways running up my neck. It's uncomfortable sometimes, and pisses me off other times. It makes me mad as it wouldn't be there if I'd have quit one of the many other times I'd tried.    I think i developed some anxiety since I quit. I'm a little unsure of what it is or how to properly to describe it to a physician. Sometimes I'm a little overwhelmed that I may have a stroke or heart attack. My balance gets a little funky, and my migraines have continued. I had an odd migraine a day or two ago that as new as I can tell was an ocular migraine. This was new and a little scary but I suppose just part of growing older. I have moments of balance issues and this is disconcerting. Just seems like for no reason I feel a little like I'm gonna fall. I don't really remember this from before I quit smoking.     I'm sure that I quit way later than I should have, but I quit. I'm done and thats a win.        I keep tabs on all you folks so don't go getting in any trouble.        Peace   R
It is good that you posted about the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I to have issues about those 3 points and still wrapping my head around them, but I try to focus on "The Good" -- to me that is important and had I not quit (looks like we chose the same day) I would not have those good things to focus on and after 44 years of smoking that is a blessing.  Continue to march on, you are doing well!!!
    Great post Rory and I'm so happy that you have found your forever quit  Sorry about the bad and ugly going on with you, I have some of that too and am unsure just how much is smoking related and just plain getting older  But the important thing is that by not smoking we have stopped, hopefully, the progression of smoking related problems. Oh and the anxiety? I've seem to have gotten that as well since quitting. Hangovers seem to bring it on so again, not sure if its just getting older or the quit.... Thanks for the update, enjoy that granddaughter of yours  
    Thank you  for the great update....you have a great quit...but am sorry Also  to hear of the ugly bits..... Nice to know your never too far away....
    Hey RoryPlog, thanks for the update. How much easier do you find singing now you don't smoke?       With the health things please see the doctor... they have heard people explain things in any number of ways so don't worry about that and not knowing will only be making the anxiety worse.... but for your beautiful grandbaby girl please just pop in for a visit and get everything checked.        Don't waste time and energy regretting that you smoked to long... because your smoked, its a fact, we all did, we can't change that fact... we can't go back in time and stop it or quit sooner... so leave it, it is what it is... live in the now and NOW you have QUIT. You are smoke free... that is what is important you can control the now and change the now, same as you can determine what you do in the future... keep your energy for those not what has gone before.      So glad your still here and lurking. Lover when you get a chance to post.
    Good to hear from you Rory-sorry to read about the blockage. Could it be contributing to the headaches and feeling off balance? Please have a physician keep an eye on it! That would make me anxious as well.    What a wonderful gift you’ve given yourself with your  ever growing quit!  Please keep taking good care of yourself.

I feel as though I run out of air a little quicker than I used to. Strangely I have had to re-learn some techniques for singing. It seems as though I have more power, and a little more range than I used to. That said, I now how to be a little more conscious of pitch and how much 'volume' I am sending towards a microphone.  The clarity of my voice is much better even after only 9 months of no smoking. The other good thing is I don't seem to 'blow out' my voice from drinking whiskey and smoking a thousand cigarettes. I really appreciate you asking this question. It has helped me add another point to the "Good" section of my post. :-)   PeaceR

Please take all of these seriously and get yourself an appointment and keep us updated. We worry, you know.     You have built yourself a really fine quit, Rory,   congratulations on your almost 10 months of Freedom.    You are doing tremendous work, for true.    Sing !  Loud and Clear.  You are a hero.

I worked with musos for 16 years and many smoked. I had heard both arguments that giving up would ruin your voice (which even junky me doubted) or it would improve it. I always thought it would improve, especially range and projection... it was wonderful to hear your personal story and you know what... there will be lurkers out there who will have the misplaced fear that it will be bad for their voice to quit and you just might have given them the final push to get over the quit line, talk about paying it forward.       I do agree with Sazerac though, please see a doctor and get a check up... it's probably nothing, just your body clearing out years of smoking but we do worry, even if your not a daily poster, we worry about our fellow travelers.
    Triggers can come out of nowhere, and in order to understand them and beat them down, you have to expect them, or recognize them for what they are - just a habit that you need to break.  Here's an interesting example.  I was over six months into one of my previous quits, working on a baseball diamond preparing it for our Opening Day games.  A friend of mine was running a Bobcat loader moving some dirt onto an infield - something we do every year.  He brings it to the diamond with the loader, I spread it out on the infield with the field groomer.  In previous years, anytime he would leave to go get more dirt, I'd reach for a smoke.  He turned and left, and I reached for Salem Lights.  Except this last time, I didn't have any because I hadn't smoked in months!  But the trigger was there, and I fell for it for a second or two and reached for the pack without even thinking about it, recognized what it was and had a good laugh, happy that I was still smoke free.  Like I said, a trigger out of nowhere...
    Our bodies have memories, conditioned responses to feelings or situations and addiction makes full use of this. It takes a while to change all this up.         You are right @Baseball Coach, "they are just a habit that you need to break' ...just a habit that you CAN break.       Congratulations on your quit, Coach, good to see you around.     
    Thanks @Baseball Coach for bringing this up. I trained myself  in recognizing them, in the beginning of my quit. I am now at a point where it really annoys me to take time to examine triggers  (most of the time they are just that.. not even craves). This reminds me how important it is to see them every time for what they are: patterns.       Changing seasons, for instance. Brings up different thoughts/moods etc. Tempting time to lay back and dwell in self pity, because of aaaaallllll the triggers 'that are still here'. While its got probably everything to do with unconciously remembering what I did as a smoker at this time of the year.          
    The good news is: years of conditioning ourselves with cigarettes can be eliminated in one-year of reconditioning our bodies and minds.  The changing of seasons, special occasions, etc. can trigger smoking thoughts.  It can feel a little awkward, maybe even a bit uncomfortable, but with a bit of resolve the new ways begin to feel normal.     It gets easier with time and eventually becomes a mere afterthought.
    To me, it's only memories.
Once a person has reached their first year anniversary, they have experienced most of their triggers.       That is why the first year anniversary is so important - this amount of time covers most situations in which the triggers can occur.            The longer you stay quit, the more time you have to experience these triggers, and just say no to them.     Eventually, almost all of them will disappear forever.          When you do experience a trigger, always keep this in mind: "A TRIGGER (or any CRAVE) IS NEVER A COMMAND".      Recognize a trigger for what it is - the weak ghost of a sleeping drug addiction - and just ignore it.      It will disappear, and then probably never return again, and that means you just gained some more freedom.          CristóbalEdited October 26, 2018 by Cristóbal
    Wow, uncanny how  I've been thinking along similar lines.       How I was wondering about so many instances where, whether happy or sad, stressed or excited, my response would be to have a smoke. And though there's been no trigger as such, I'm quite wary of one popping up suddenly. This is an interesting read because it reminds me how I still can be tricked by my mind and "constant vigilance" (Potter fans would recognize this phrase) is the only way forward.
    After two years, I think most of my triggers are gone.  But you never know.   Thanks to all for participating and helping others stay strong.
So I am less than two hours away from being 6 days into this quit.  In some ways it feels so insignificant when I think how long a quit I gave up last time, but hey ho, must carry on regardless.  Am finding this time a little harder because my life is such a bloody mess at the moment. But I'm doing my best to keep busy, I even cooked myself a healthy dinner tonight to make up for my awful day yesterday (although i did have a huge bar of chocolate earlier!).       I also went to the animal refuge again.  This is a picture of me and a beauceron called Jude.  He's only four years old and nearly blind.  He has a genetic disease which means he will totally lose his sight eventually.  Sad thing is he has come in with his son and four daughters......they too are nearly blind.  But my, what beautiful souls they have. It bought tears to my eyes spending some time with them.  I know this is not smoking related per se, but it helps me to focus on something else.
Congratulations on 6 days, Pumpkin.     I think it is great what you are doing at the animal refuge and I'm glad it is helping to keep your mind off of smoking.
^^^ Yes! What Johnny said!   
6 days already? Seems like you just got here and suddenly it's almost a week already        Keep it up!
Aww beautiful picture...what a great way to spend some time...  Well done Pumpkin...6 days is a very significant  quit...x
Congrats, those first 6 days are brutal. Good job
    Congrats on almost being done with hell week pumpkin and I too think it's a great thing what you're doing for the animals. He seems very happy to see you

    Yes, giving your time at a place like this is not only a great distraction for you in the early days of your quit but so important to those animals who through no fault of their own find themselves in need of human companionship. You can provide food and water for animals but they all need that human connection - even cats who seem so independent most of the time.      Great work Pumpkin!!
Congrats on 6 days free from the chains of smoking slavery, Pumpkin!!   Keep those doggie kisses coming, I love it!!
    One week free from cigerette slavery!!  Celebrate, Pumpkin! Do a little dance, kiss every dog you see, and really be proud of yourself! You are worth it!
    Hey Pumpkin!! Just squirreling in here to see how you are doing...  Hope you are feeling good, give us a shout if you need some cheers!

Agree 100% - we hate to see people willingly jump off the train and yes; it's a conscious decision one makes to either continue their quit or go back to slowly killing themselves by smoking! If you truly WANT to quit and are having a hard moment - post up on the SOS page. That's what it's there for. You WILL get responses and fast. All you have to do is hang on for a few minutes and someone will give you some useful input. Can't count how many quits have been saved by SOS posts. Sadly, even more lost when no SOS is posted
    I was just sitting outside watching the late afternoon sun and clouds and enjoying a simple serenity.  I came to realize that I could smell autumn again.  I remember that when I was younger I always enjoyed the smell of autumn.  This may not seem all that impactful to others but it is huge to me -- many, many memories and feelings long suppressed have come back.  One more thing that I am grateful for and can use if any cravings come along.  Quitting smoking has brought so many simple pleasures back!!!!
    I remember when my sense of smell and taste came back, funny thing is I didn't know it was gone until I got it back! Enjoy your Autumn smells 
    Can relate. The southwest desert has a smell like no other this time of year if you get out of the city Delightful! Enjoy your quit and hang in there! Best wishes.
It's these small things that often make the biggest impact on us as we transition through the seasons of the first year of our quit. Enjoy to the max M5
    Smoking covered and muffled all our senses, it is such a pleasure to hear of your re-discovery. Breathe deep your magnificent Autumn !
    Yes! Drying leaves, wet dirt, fire places  Ahhhhh....non-smokers have the good life! Enjoy!
Here is another one -   I remember when you went through your own three month battle. And now, it is almost 10 months, and close to a year.
    ^^^^^  Oh so true Jet Black, thanks for that memory!!!
    Yes... the other day I was outside and it was hot and I could smell the rain coming... you know that dusty, hot ashfelt, nirtogen in the air smell before a thunderstorm.... haven't smelt that in years and I love the rain is coming smell.        
Hi all,     Celebrating 10 months smoke free tomorrow.  I had a day a few weeks back after a terrible night's sleep when I was THIS close to buying or bumming a smoke, and was at the point where I considered writing an SOS.  But I gathered my thoughts, recounted my reasons, and stayed quit.     My daughter kissed me goodbye when I dropped her off at school today, and said "You smell so nice, mom."        Small moments with huge rewards.
    You know yourself now, how bad smokers STINK! I feel like saying to folk, omg, you STINK? Haha.     Good for you, ten months and going strong  
    You're doing awesome and how nice it is for your daughter to notice that! I'm really happy for you farmgirl  
CELEBRATING 10 MONTHS FREE!!!   Scream that to the world! Let it out because how wonderful for you and your family! Congrats Farmgirl!  Never give up, never give in! This is the start of the rest of your smoke free life and how sweet it is!
I'm glad you didn't light up, Farmgirl.  Weird cravings and smoking thoughts do pop up on occasion months after you've quit but they become weaker and less frequent with time.  I hope that is the case for you.       I'm amazed at how bad smokers smell now.  That's one of the great rewards for quitting - not smelling like that anymore.        Congrats on 10 months smoke free.  You have done a great thing in quitting.
I Don't exactly feel like smoking but feeling incredibly sad and vulnerable.  We are still on vacation and my 103 yr. old lady friend that I care for is having heart failure.  They have sent her home with hospice.  I am afraid she will pass before I get home.  I love this lady so much and just expected her to live forever.  She has done so well and this is so sudden.  We have two days before we are home.  I guess I need prayers for what is best.  I Don't know if it will be hard for me if she passes before I get home or better for me.  I do know I will be very broken hearted with her not in my life.  She was one special lady.
Hey Linda, hang in there.  It's a difficult 2 days for sure.        I think you did great posting here.
    I'm so sorry about your friend Linda, is there anyway for you to get home in time to see her? If not, maybe you can call her and tell her how much she means to you?
    These few days are going to be hard for you, friend.    You've spoken of this woman before and I know she has been a good friend, a balm for you.   The world will be a sadder place without her.       Plus, you are picking up your parents at the casino for the ride home ? Oh, brother. Oh dear.   I will be thinking of you and sending all goodness and kindness.    Stay close to the board, Linda. Your troops are here.    
    Geez, I forgot you have to pick up your folks. Call your loser brother and tell him you have an emergency and he will have to go to pick up your parents
    I did call her.  She is very depressed and did not want to talk but I did tell her I love her.  I am not sure if she knows this is her time.  Her niece has kept me informed.  We have to retrieve my mom and dad from the casino.  We are going to tell them we have to go home a day early.  
    Oh Linda my heart goes out to you. I am positive you bring as much love to her life as she does to yours.       I will keep you all in my thoughts and prayers x     
@Sazerac I will keep close I know you are there for me.  The trip home with my parents will be tough.  They do lack empathy and will be upset they have to go home.  
Can't you just leave them there, indefinitely?      I am so sorry for this sudden change in your friends health. I know how special she is to you. 103 is an amazing life. She has seen so much and been a part of so much history. To be 103 and still at home speaks of her character and her support network. I am glad you have spoken with her and hope that you get to visit with her again before her time comes. Her friendship and love is something you will have always, long after she has gone her light will shine on always in your heart.       Stay close, we are here, and all my love for the car trip home with the parental units.... still think you should just leave them at the casino.... I will keep you and your friend in my prayers.
    I'm so sorry linda 
I lift you and your friend to the Lord, Linda Thomas.   There is strength in numbers and we are here for you!!  Many hugs and many loves and maybe a stick or 2
    I am praying for you, Linda....and your dear friend! 
    Wow! This is very unfortunate news. Sorry to hear your friend has taken a sudden turn for the worse health wise. Double whammy having to deal with your overbearing parents on the drive home. I hope you can just tune them out while you remember all the goodness your friend has brought into your life over the years. I'm sure the feeling is mutual with your friend. Let us know how you're doing when you can please. You have an army of quitters here ready and willing to support you. 
    Dear Linda, I am so sorry to hear this.         Glad you take the oldies home early. They probably won't understand anyway but that doesn't matter. But for you I whish you can be with whatever emotion you have, without having to deal with them in ways that are too demanding right now.       Promiss to post whenever you want. That goes for the SOS section as well.  Take care!
    Prayers any hugs Linda....  Please have a safe journey home.... You and your friend have been blessed to have a friendship that you have together...    Stay close..... You have good friends here...who will support you through this journey.....xx
    Oh Linda, I’m so sorry. Words aren’t enough in such situations. You’ve had beautiful friendship, it is something to cherish, even through tears. 
    Thinking of you, you beautiful and powerful smoke free woman !
@Sazerac I know you are and that you have my back.  Well the old folks threw a tantrum and refused to go home.  We are leaving Saturday morning to head home.  Needless to say I am very aggravated at them but so much wiser.      I do believe, with my new found confidence and the support of my quit buds, I have the strength to not allow them to take advantage anymore.  I do count and need to start putting myself first.    I might need a few good vibes sent my way to get through the drive home and my mom's whining.   My husband and I had a nice time.  It is amazing how different your life is without the smoking chain around your neck.     My friend is hanging on.  I almost think she is waiting for me to get home. Thanks, my dear forum friends, for being there and @c9jane29 for all my lovely sticks.
    I'm glad your friend is hanging in there Linda, I sure wish that you had of stood up to your parents and told them to leave now or find their own way home! Once you finally do that you will get such a feeling of pride in standing up for yourself. I just know it

Pissy parents, cold nights, alien smokers listen up: Linda Thomas says NOPE! so get out of her way! Prayers, friend...
    Sending my prayers Linda.... and you most definitely do count. You are Linda, we hear you roar. How does quitting feel... liberating. 
    Prayers coming from Liverpool too Linda...  You arrived to spend time with your special friend.... This is all that mattered...enjoy every moment you can together...   Your uncaring parents...will have to get accustomed to thier new strong daughter... I'm proud of you...
    Hope you are home and able to be with your friend.  Please take a lot of time for yourself, Linda, grieve and rejoice over her life.     
    Thinking of you Linda and hope you are ok. We are all here for you whenever you need us.        It will be a long path but you'll never be walking it alone. 
Well we are home and safe.  It was a long ride home with my parents because they are not happy we won't be taking them back to the casino.  I also told my mom I was going to spend more time giving care to my friend so she can stay in her home till the end.  I do hope to have a little more time with her but realize she is 103.   My mom will just have to count on my brother to help and pay to have her groceries delivered.     Thanks for all the words of encouragement.  I don't know what I would do without you all.
The beautiful thing about being successful at quitting smoking is that you suddenly realize that you can now do anything and, that you are worth doing things that will improve the quality of your life. You too are now doing this Linda. Keep moving forward  Live your life the way YOU want to. Help others but NOT at your own expense!Edited October 20, 2018 by reciprocity
    Glad you're home Linda and you've made it on time to be there for your friend. I'm so proud of you for standing up to your parents, big hug coming your way!

Being with those near death is very much like being a mid-wife. You can make the ending so much better, kinder, calmer. Be sure to nurture yourself while you nurture her...        I am so proud of you for the progress you have made.    Not only have you quit smoking, you have now garnered a nice batch of power and are able to set reasonable boundaries with your parents.    Little adjustments will make a real difference in your life.    Later, you can make larger adjustments as your needs change and your power grows.       Hold tight to your resolve....not only your commitment to NOPE  but, your commitment to yourself to make your life a sweeter and kinder place.      love,   s
So Relieved for you Linda,you made it home ,to spend valuable time with your special friend.... It's so important you get to say Goodbye to your friend by her side....I have just experienced this for myself....  What a grand old lady ...I wonder what her advice would be to live a full happy life to 103.....    You said NO to your folks ...how empowering did that feel...good I'm imagining....  I agree when we Quit ...it gives us the strength in other aspects of our lives....we can do anything ....   Enjoy your time together...xx
    Glad you're home safe and sound, friend!!   Take some time for Linda only now!! I read on MLMRs thread that you like crafts and such but feel like you let yourself get away from doing those kind of things... I think now is the perfect time to start again. It will help occupy your hands and mind as these emotional times come up. Idle hands are the devil's play thing.        Hugs and loves for you as always!!       
    I found this funny; made me think of you and @notsmokinjo dog talk over in Stick alley...       Hope you have a great new day as a non-smoker! 
    Hey @Linda Thomas apologies for seeing this so late. Hope you are doing well, and hope your friend is better.       She's in my prayers too. God bless you for the strength you've shown in keeping your quit. That's amazing. Stay strong.
I have not smoked, not even a little cheat poot puff puff, in 2 weeks!!! It feels good. It's the second longest quit I've had. Still walking on egg shells and having mad cravings, but minute by minute I am making it as a non smoker.    N.O.P.E.
    This. Is. Awesome!      Keep it up! One day at a time is all you can do. Give yourself an "atta girl" every night when you go to bed and a pep talk every morning when you get up. Take lots and lots of deep breaths and really try to pay attention to just how deep and good those breaths feel now compared to two weeks ago.       You can do this!
Well done....you have every right to feel proud...your half way to that important first month ....  Jim is spot on...1 day at a time....    Keep NOPE...ing  ...
    Hell week and Heck week are behind you! Now just put the babe thread behind you and lemme pay you women back for hijacking boo's thread ....            Good job
Congrats (T)!! Reward yourself every day to reinforce all the hard work you've put in the past 2 weeks.     ETQ to KTQ!!
    Congratulations on getting past your first two weeks!
    Great job... you can do this.... keep up the great work.
Way to show those horses asses you mentioned who have been tempting you to start up again.  You certainly showed them who's in charge    Edited October 24, 2018 by reciprocity

Good job!    Edited November 19, 2018 by Boo
GREAT JOB  2 weeks is wonderful.
    Congratulations IGT. Two weeks is BIG.  Before you know it this will become your longest quit ever.  Until then, NOPE.
Great news, IGT.  You are making it through the roughest days.  Keep up the great work and don't forget to reward yourself for the awesome job you are doing.Edited October 24, 2018 by johnny5
    Yay IGT, congrats on being done with hell week AND heck week! You're doing GREAT! 
    Awesome! 
    Awesome stuff  IGT, keep your quit...great to see your hard work and determination pay off.
Here is an introductory article about NicA2Nicotine Eating Bacteria that was published a few years ago   and a brand new sci/nerd publication from NCBIAn enzymatic approach reverses nicotine dependence, decreases compulsive-like intake, and prevents relapse
    Crazy cool...hopefully it will one day replace the nrt that contain nicotine.
Very tired. Soooooo extremely tired. I got good sleep last night, but after I woke up I napped off and on until noon and have been lounging around ever since. I don't remember being this exhausted in my last quit attempts ( I have had 2... One lasted a couple of months and the other a couple of days.) On the bright side cravings have been minimal today, probably because I'm so freaking tired and getting my happy ass up to go outside is waaaaaaaay too much work.
    That does sound strange, in that you say you got a good sleep and all. I do remember feeling very tired every day in the early days of my quit but I always assumed it was because mentally I was fighting the early quit symptoms so hard each day that it just wore me out. That and I just wanted to be asleep as often as possible because it made the craving for a smoke go away for awhile   As with all quit symptoms, I'm sure this too will pass but yes, it's annoying when you need to get stuff done, go to work etc. and you're dog-tired  
    It might not be quit related.... worst symptom of first trimester is fatigue.. your not up the duff are ya?     Seriously though, it seems to be a pretty even split with quitters they are either very fatigued when they first quit or they have quit insomnia and cant sleep for want of trying. Give it a couple of weeks and if its not improving I'd see ya doc just to make sure all is good.
    Sounds like me when I first quit, its very normal. Sleep as much as you can, you cant smoke then 
    I was extremely tired too so I agree it's normal, should get better soon. But if not I also agree to see your dr.  
    Yep was same for me.. could hardly drag my arse outta bed some days..

Definitely not pregnant..... hubby is fixed and Aunt Flow just phoned and said she'll be here in a few days for a visit.
    Yup. It's official. Everyone in this ******* town KNOWS I quit smoking. Even total strangers. Even the people on tv ffs!! They ALL know!! And for whatever reason they are all purposely trying to irritate the hell out of me. They are all thinking " won't it be fun to try and make Mary crack!!??" Yup. Every. Last. One. Of. Them.    And I know what you're all thinking... you're thinking I'm just being super sensitive because I quit smoking. Nope. Not it at all. Clearly everyone just has it out for me. Bastards.
    Not everybody.!!!!!!    You have a train full of supporters here... This is YOUR Quit....who cares what other folks think...    There were shall I say..quite a few doubters when I quit this time...well i had quit that many times ..to them this was just another feeble attempt...  But it didn't matter....I was Quitting for me....not for them...    Just hang around here...we will always give you a well earned pat on the back ...    
 Feelings, nothing more than feelings         Anger boiling in me         I want to punch their faces                                             (but i don't) Woh-uhoh... Can't go to wal-mart; I'll get stuck behind an old fart       In a motorized fat cart....         Stop at a red light; give the finger to a hot wife                 Her smoke is getting in my car!!   Feeelings..who-ooh-uhoh Can't take them out, but I can't hold them in!! where oh where do I begin??...                              (I don't know so...)    I'll just keep punching faces from within.  (Insert glitter bomb here)      It's okay, (T)!! I had a huge anger problem when I first quit...sometimes I can still feel my blood pressure rise.  Eat some chocolate, make sure you are giving yourself breaks (just to take a step back like you used to as a smoker just no cigarettes) You got this, girl!      
Like Doreen said, you're quitting for YOU and a better future for you and your family. Screw anyone who threatens that in any way. They don't deserve your attention for 1 second. You need to expend all your focus, anger and joy on one thing alone. Getting yourself quit and staying that way. You KNOW you can do it! It's now just a matter of whether your commitment is iron-clad because you also know it must be to get you through to freedom.
    Sorry you're having a rough patch I got this but it's totally normal for where you are in your quit and I promise you it will pass. AND like Doreen said you have a whole train behind you so when someone pisses you off just say "choo choo". It'll totally trip them out and maybe give you a giggle 
    I remember thinking,    'why did I not notice all these fcukers before ?    How have all these irritations been hidden from me all these years ? '  True, smoking masks a lot but, surely, not that much...gah.     I definitely blew my cool when I quit.  Even more when I quit caffeine !    Thankfully, it settles down and isn't right up in your face after a while.  lol.        Go down to the railroad tracks, wait for a train and practice your primal screaming.    Extremely therapeutic.   
    Ooh, Mary.....Hell Week/Month! I remember it well....everything and everyone around me irritated the hell out of me....and I blasted them for it!   I was impossible to be around myself....but as Saz states above...it all settles down eventually! Deep breathing helped.....
Thanks for all of your replies!!! I feel much better after sleep. One more 10 hr shift.... it's Sunday so there shouldn't be too many crazies out..... I hope.... but it's also my Friday so I will have the next 2 days off, yay!
    That's great! Sorry you have to deal with the crazies as part of your job. I'm sure a lot of them are smokers too. The rest of us can just avoid those types in the early days of our quits. You unfortunately can't. Extra challenge but you can handle it I'm sure   Don't forget to be extra kind to yourself in these early days too. You have extra on your plate at the moment.
    Hi Mary     FEK them all    its your life your extending stick with it.

Me too!  My husband used to point them out all the time and I always thought he was just a crabby old man.  Then, all of a sudden they started jumping out at me!   Well ten hour shift is enough to put you over the edge.  How do you do it!      The first part of my quit, I wanted to strangle everyone.  Fortunately everyone survived!   Hang in, you are doing great.
    Are they scoffing at the fact that you quit?    Is it one of those rude things like, "Oh yeah, SURE you quit smoking. Huh huh huh"?     If so, let me tell you a little secret -    When we have an established quit, say a few months, we get to start talking shit We get to be like, "So, I quit MY bad habit, when you gonna quit yours?"    If they are scoffing, then LET THEM SCOFF! It will be more motivation to flip nicotine the bird AND when you prove the naysayers wrong, they can no long mess with you.     BUT if it is just a matter of noticing what dipwads people really are - That partially passes but beware - people start driving a little worse every time someone quits nicotine.   
I have just seen the BBC reporting that Phillip Morris the manufacturers of Marlboro are advising Smokers in the UK to Quit smoking cigarettes.     But they are advising them to take up vaping or e cigs.     Its hard to believe that they are trying to recruit people to other forms of smoking to keep their business going.      Im not sure they should be allowed to do it.https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=Philip+Morris+Quit+Smoking&amp;qpvt=philip+morris+quit+smoking&amp;FORM=EWREEdited October 22, 2018 by despair not
That is ridiculous.... I am beginning to hate vaping and e cigs as much as I hate normal cigs. I am not sure that they are as prolific here yet.        So this story is a bit sad, and I agree I don't think they should be allowed to do it either.       On the plus side, I heard in the NEWS here that Britain now has more ex-smokers than they have current smokers... but I'm not sure if vapers are included in that figure.       Here is an article on the smoking numbers and smokers being far outnumbered by ex-smokers.... way to go Great Britain...     https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/number-of-uk-smokers-falls-to-lowest-level
    Gday    You'd think these companies would also want another world war to come along to boast thier sales as well.....   Not satisfied that we have figured out Nicotine and its various delivery    systems actually kill the customer .... funny about that.   C
    I've just heard this ....Words fail me....they are nothing short of murdering B*******s......   Somewhere down the line ....e cigs will be proven to kill folks too.... It's great news Britain has more Quitters...than Nicotine smokers...
I had heard about this too! I heard UK governments were pushing to ban single use filters and control unnecessary packaging.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/environment/cost-cigarettes-rise-tobacco-industry-smoking-environment-who-climate-change-pollution-a8564796.html%3famp
    Phillip Morris is a bunch of bastards. If they said vegetables were healthy, i probably would not believe them. It is not unusual for companies to divert customers away from one of their OWN products only to push a different one.       I do not get though -   Even if vaping is less harmful, less expensive, less illegal, etc, isn't quitting altogether COMPLETELY free, legal, and healthy?       Free, now THAT is a word us Sagittarius like. And us cheap skates.
    I am sure you all guessed that I smoked on my birthday due to my lack of updates.       I drank way too much and learnt that I can't be trusted around alcohol.         I wasn't sure whether I should show my face here again and feel really embarrassed. I realised today that beating myself up was not helping in any way. I was just running towards smoking and getting further away from a quit. So I've stopped the self pity and restarted the clock.                  
If you have learned a lesson because of what happened to you on the weekend and can put that to use in your new quit then that's a good thing. You shouldn't worry about what others might think but be only concerned for your own well being and that would include a successful quit! That one should be at the top of your list for a better life. You did all the planning before so, let's get you off those smokes for good. Stay close to this place for the first while anyway. Support and education about smoking is important in the early days.

    Thanks Reci.        Pottanramu I'm a bit confused why you did a laughing smiley?
    I don't keep any cigarettes Pottanramu. That would be a disaster waiting to happen.         I'm staying well away from alcohol Whispers. 
    Well, now you know alcohol and birthdays are triggers; please stay away from both!! I'm glad you realized that a birthday isn't any excuse to forget about quitting.    This time we commit to the quit! we embrace the quit!  we love the quit! This quit is the one that will save your life.
    Agree with everything Jane especially this -        This﻿ time we commit to the quit! we embrace the quit!  we love ﻿the quit! This quit is the one that will save your life.﻿﻿
    Glad you're back Lilly after all you did promise to show us all those awesome charms you are going to get with each month quit...….
And I promise you will see all 12 charms Jillar
I was just thinking about you today, Lilly and I'm glad you are back !  You quit smoking tonight and this is great news !   I stayed away from alcohol for a few weeks, when I drank again no craves ever popped up.    They popped up other places having to do with ritual and habit but, drinking didn't summon smokes for me.       I absolutely LOVE what @c9jane29 said,   This﻿ time we commit to the quit! we embrace the quit!  we love ﻿the quit! This quit is the one that will save your life.﻿﻿
    Glad to see you back, and great you are sounding so  confident about your charm bracelet.
    Glad your back Lilly.  It shows your determination.  Everyday is a new day, so let this be your new beginning.  You can do this.

    I am glad your back... Coming back after a lost quit is the best way forward. Learn from last time and apply the lessons. So great to see you back in the saddle.
I feel absolutely disgusted at myself but I'm chain smoking, crying and feeling terrified.      I have had a sore in my mouth for weeks and I don't have my own teeth so at first thought that was the cause. I can feel it with my tongue and this morning it feels much bigger. I got the thought of it being cancer in my head and the thought has spiralled out of control. I can't tell anyone as it just doesn't seem right to scare everyone else. I have got doctors at 3.50 but my mind is just going into overdrive.      The stupidest part of all is I'm sobbing at the thought of cancer, but lighting up the very thing that causes it.       I'm sorry I'm just really scared and needed to talk to someone but this probably isn't the right place.
@Lilly, I hope you re-read that post and really really understand that your drug addiction has over-ridden your desire for survival.    "I don't want to die, but I'll keep drinking the poison"    You need to get educated about your addiction.  Yes, please, go to the Dr., get the medicine for your sore and maybe mention that you are a smoker and want to quit. Your Dr. could help deciding on NRT if that's what you need.   I will not take excuses, and no kid gloves right now; I tried nice. Early in my quit, I had to drive 7hrs (one way) to a pediatric cardiologist, stay in a hotel for 3-4 days at a time and drive back by myself...sometimes with 3 kids in tow. I did this for months! Had to watch my daughter go thru...hell. Hell for a 2yr old.    Never. Not. One. Time. Did I put a cigarette in my mouth. (Or her's)    That's why no excuse will work with me. The ONLY way you will EVER quit is to STOP putting the damn things in your mouth.   That's it. The end. NOPE.    Edited October 19, 2018 by c9jane29
    I completely understand addiction Jane which is why I said what I did about the fear but smoking at the same time.      I hope nobody else decides to take the kid gloves off because right now isn't the time to kick me.      If all people can see in that post is a relapse then I hope they will just walk away and not contribute. 
    Lilly.  I felt like you.  Smoking and knowing I would most likely get cancer.  Heck I smoked through breast cancer and radiation!  Now I am praying that I quit in time to avoid a horrible death.  How could I have been so stupid.  I was addicted and thought I could not live a life without cigs.  I tried smoking clinics and hypnosis and nothing helped until I landed here.  There is courage and support here and none of us are judging you.  We are hurting for you because we have all been there.  Together we have been able to shed the dreaded addiction.  While I was on vacation, I found myself looking at smokers as if they were aliens.  Never did I ever feel this was possible but it is.      Get yourself checked and we will go from there.  Know that I will be right there with you praying.  Together all things are possible.
    I'm not "kicking" you. I'm telling you the truth.   People are going to "contribute" things that you don't want to hear. Take it or leave it but I'm pretty passionate about helping people quit smoking so I'm not going to keep fluffing your butt.    I hate knowing that your addiction has activated enought "woe-is-me" areas of your brain that you lost a quit over night (twice that I know of)    I will stop posting on your thread here, but I beg you to continue learning about the changes nicotine makes in your brain; this is the only way you will build the defense to fight against it.     
    I spent the last few cigarettes with tears too....I knew something was not right with my feet / ank!es....i was right....   I was told STOP SMOKING NOW.....Lilly I did....and slowly I started healing...  You need to get checked out....throw the cigs down the toilet ....and commit to NOPE......  People are not  kicking you Lily ..they are being totally honest with you ...   Smoking will never make things better..only worse....    
    You fear smoking will kill you, and when you are afraid you smoke to calm your nerves.      I recommend that you step back and review.      Transcede this death-spiral or be claimed by it.        I'm not judging you, merely pointing out that this is where you stand.      You are at the edge where the winds of limbo roar.      I have faith that you can succeed.  That you have the resolve within you.       Crisis is the knife edge that can fuel your break through.      Have faith in yourself.     Focus on your goal.     Understand that the pain is transitory, but the freedom from addiction will last as long as you want it.        What we pay for most dearly we prize most highly.   You will look back and swear that quitting was the best decision you ever made.     ...and keep posting.  Win-lose-draw everyone on this train is rooting for you.      Never quit quitting.     
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly Either you want to quit or you want to smoke.   This is a simple choice and I hope you choose LIFE  but, I cannot choose for you nor, commit to your NOPE.  You must do the work and I know you can.    We quit and we are not special snowflakes.      This is no time for kid gloves, sugar.  This is your friggin' LIFE we are talking about.    Please get serious about your life and your health !    You have gotten a fearful physical wake up call....use it to your advantage. Use it to motivate your quit.      Hope your MD sorts you out right quick  and you begin to understand the damage you are doing to yourself by smoking and STOP causing yourself trauma and injury.        Quitting smoking is not that hard once you are educated and committed....and every day of freedom is glorious.      Do let us know you are OK, Lilly.  We worry.        Love,   Sazerac     p.s.   I am in full agreement with @c9jane29's thoughts and advice and really honored she told us a part of her amazing story.      Tough Love is real love and honest love just like the warm fluffy love.     It is all LOVE.         I have this advise  #1  Remember, We All Want To See You Have A Successful Quit.    #2  Take What You Need And Leave The Rest.  No one here wants to hurt you, we want to help you stop poisoning yourself.     S        Edited October 19, 2018 by Sazerac
I'm hoping you find its only a canker sore Lilly and use that as a wake up call. We just lost a friend to oral cancer. He was only 47 and he fought so hard to beat it that he had his teeth removed, parts of his jaw, cheeks and half his tongue before the drs told him there was nothing else they could do.    Chain smoking isn't going to make that bump any better, so it's time to put on your big girl panties and get back to your quit!Edited October 19, 2018 by jillarstupid auto correct
    Lily, what helped me with this quit was that  smoking would not solve the issue. It will not cure my headache, it will not pay debts, it will not amend relationship. Yes, for years we had a habit to smoke when things weren’t right, but they didn’t become right with smoking. I feel for you and hope you’re healthy, but smoking is not the way. 
    I'm sorry to hear about your relapse, Lilly.  Be careful with alcohol in the early days and weeks of a quit.        Smoking does not help anything.  It is all a lie.  You are much better off without cigarettes.  I hope you get back to your quit soon.  Yes, it is tough, but a smoke-free life is worth the early struggles and life as a smoker will only get worse and worse.
    Thanks for all the messages.        Just wanted to let you all know I do have a mass in my mouth but it certainly doesn't appear cancerous. She felt my neck and said my lymph nodes are fine whatever that means.      Just didn't want anyone worrying. 
That's the best news the doc could give. You must be so relieved, Lilly!        I have something for you. It's a message from someone you know very well.    'I have been dabbling with quitting since the nineties. My quits varied in length ie 10 minutes, 10 hours and now and again weeks. I threw the towel in on every quit I had because I just wasn't willing to endure a bit of discomfort. It was much easier to go and buy a packet of cigarettes than it was to feel "out of sorts."    I would provoke arguments at home so I could blame the other person for driving me back to smoking. I would get a flat tyre and be dancing at the roadside because nobody would expect me to keep my quit under such trying circumstances. I wanted to be a non smoker but at the same time I just couldn't let go.     If you find yourself in the same position then join the forum and ask for help. Reaching out to people who have already quit could be the missing piece of the jigsaw for you like it was for me. I did it a couple of days ago and am so grateful to everyone who took the time to encourage and share their hints, tips and recipes for success.      I found out today that when I smoked a cigarette I kind of did it on auto pilot.  I would think of a cigarette, light it, smoke it and put it out. Today I really concentrated on each cigarette and realised they don't taste great at all and I didn't enjoy any of them. The realisation that I actually was just an addict getting their fix was a bit of a revelation. I always disputed that theory and was adamant I loved smoking but now I know I was blinded by my addiction.     Read this site as much as you can because it really is a treasure chest of information. Set a quit date and stock up on plenty of quit food. You will get so caught up in the excitement of quitting here you will be desperate to start your own quit. As they say here you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.'     You wrote this a while ago. I wonder, what will be your next step?      I would like to give you faith and courage, but I can't. Yet, I am convinced you have it in you,  as we all do!                  Edited October 20, 2018 by MLMR
    Well we were worrying Lilly and I am so glad you let us know.  Please know you will have my continued prayers for your health and the ability to quit.      I know you can do it Lilly.  Let this be the scare that solidifies your quit.   Being uncomfortable for a period of about three weeks is nothing compared to the feeling of not smoking.  I had almost resolved myself to most likely dying of lung cancer.  My self esteem was so low I did not think I cared.  Now I feel like a different person.    C'mon girl let us do this together.
    Thanks everyone.        I will be back and I will quit. Just need to get my head back in the right place.       Jane don't stay away. I posted on a quit smoking forum that I was chain smoking. You took your kid gloves off not to kick me but to help me. After all it is a quit smoking site at the end of the day. I just wasn't seeing anything clearly yesterday. I hear you today. 
    If you want to heal your mouth as soon as possible, you will quit smoking.  Smoking only exacerbates the problem.   Please, Lilly.  Take care of yourself.
    I will Sazerac and sooner rather than later.        I have been referred to the hospital and they will do a biopsy which apparently they do as standard and not because the doctor was concerned.       I'm going to be fine but if I continue smoking I might not get a second chance.
21 minutes ago, Lilly said:             I'm﻿﻿ going to ﻿﻿be fine but if I continue smoking ﻿I might not get a second chance.            This should be your mantra when you start your quit again...because it is the raw truth.    Continue to read around here and whyquit.com while you find your quit.@Sazerac bumped this post in the Introductions page   There is so. much. POWER. in that thread! I realized after I quit that it's the people that want you to keep smoking (smoking friends, your addicted brain, and big tobacco) that say how devestatingly hard it is to quit. Harder than heroin!!    Lies. Lies. Lies.   Then you come here and it's just...not.     Keep finding that quit Lilly!!
    Lily....you have had  warning...    Look at this at a chance to quit...and stay quit....    I too was given a chance...and I took it....    The whole train is behind you...believe and love yourself ...as much as we do...    No time like the present ....to pledge a NOPE ....
    Lily, first, I am happy and relieved the changes aren’t cancerous.  Second, please, treat it as a wake up call. Smoking has done enough harm, don’t allow it do any more, please.    
^^^ I agree with Doreen (and others) Lilly! Take the plunge NOW! There's NEVER a perfect time to quit. There will always be sacrifice and unpleasantness involved in the early days no matter when you quit so ..... what are you waiting for. Just make that commitment to yourself NOW! Your "head space" will be thrown out of kilter anyway in the early part of your quit so don't wait for that perfect clarity of mind to quit. These are all excuses that your addicted brain is feeding you to prevent you from doing what's best for you. Just quit and we will all be here to support you every minute of the day and night when necessary.. I can tell you for certain, your future happiness depends on the path you choose now. Come on .... why not quit  Edited October 20, 2018 by reciprocity
    So glad to hear the doc isn't concerned about it being cancer just wish you hadn't of given up that day you had quit. NOW I have to wait even longer to see that first month charm   P.S. I keep bringing up the charm bracelet because I LOVE the idea and wish I had of thought of that lol. Seriously though, you have to be ready to quit in order to succeed so when you're truly ready we will be here  
@Lilly  Get your head back in the game. There is no perfect time to quit like mentioned, my last cigg was the 24th in 2015 two days before Thanksgiving .
    You have been given great news, be thankful and quit today, you never know if continued smoking may cause something to change again!,!! Give yourself the best gift and quit today and start collecting those charms.   All the best.
    Lilly, the train says hi!! Hope you haven't given up on your quit! Please give yourself this gift...it will change your life.   Don't give up on yourself!! YOU ARE WORTH IT!
    You know too much now, Lilly, to ever be an obedient slave again.   Smoking has been ruined for you and will never be the comfort it once was.  You know too much.      Soon,  you will defeat your addiction.  Why not ?
Cravings are the most feared in a quit and we all know they can be uncomfortable. It's this fear that keeps many of us from even attempting to quit smoking. The fear of being uncomfortable.  We feel this way even though we know that smoking related disease is probably not terribly comfortable either.....addiction is so not rational.... The addiction wants to manipulate you into believing that there is no way you could ever survive quitting.  No way you could ever get through a minute, hour or day feeling like you want to smoke and not give in.   Seriously.....Pffft.  We're tougher than that.  It's all just hype designed to keep you smoking.  A crave is not a command to smoke.  Just because you feel it, does not mean you need to act on it.  Acknowledge it and move on.  As time goes on, those craves will fade away and in it's place will be a person who stood up and took control of their life.  There is no greater feeling than that.  No greater feeling.
The craves! The craves are the signal that you have triumphed over the addiction. The crave comes because you have refused to smoke. You ignore it and it goes away. It comes less and less. Welcome the crave - it means you are getting it done.
This was the first time I ever tried to quit. I did not know what to expect. I used to joke that I would need to be hidden away for awhile so I would not scream and rant.  When I did quit, I went about my life as it was before. I was not in the bedt of moods but I did not turn into domething I could not control.  It sucked but it was foable and worth it to be done with smoking. 
I crave lifeSmoking sucks
In the beginning I tried to watch a lot if videos about smoking, and smoking related diseases... That made it easier to tell myself to 'man-up' when I got a crave - what is worse; 3 minutes of mild discomfort every so often, or a (shortened) lifetime of misery from a terminal disease caused by smoking...?!  No contest!
I have had some craves, holiday triggers. I chose nope, sadly my mum chose a now second deck of cigs. My informed choice was not difficult. A crave is simply an auto pilot response and you always have the choice to say yes or no. 
Craves are just thoughts....When ever I have a crave....I try and turn a negative in to a positive....I'm feeling like this at the moment..because I'm ridding myself of a poison...repairing my poor neglected lungs....As time goes on ...the craves get lesser and weaker.....
nobody every died from a crave plenty die as a result of giving into that crave...over and over again.  great post miss jenny jenn! :)
Fear has a lot to answer for, before I quit it's the one thing that stopped me from jumping on a quit sooner, fear that i just won't be able to do it, the reason more people are not quit is not because they can't it's because they won't, fear is holding them back Don't be afraid nothing to fear but fear itself
Fear is what prevented me from quitting for so long.   Once I faced the fear, it became ridiculously easy.
I didn't fear quitting....frankly, I rarely, if ever, thought about quitting.   Then I quit and took a day at a time as usual.      I didn't fear craves    they were a minor annoyance.  OK they were a horrible annoyance for a while.        I didn't fear relapse.  If my quit didn't stick, I would quit again or not.     Fear didn't figure into my equation.    I have fears just like everybody but, not about quitting or staying quit.       I was riding on quitting on a whim....let's quit for a year and see what it feels like. You can always go back to smoking.Edited September 20, 2018 by Sazeracclarity
I would guess that the overwhelming reason that most people don't attempt or delay quitting smoking is out of fear.  They fear that withdrawal is unbearable.  They fear how hard it is because others told them it was.  They're afraid because they think they'll be unable to cope with stress, enjoy alcohol, a meal, a night out with friends, morning coffee and the biggest one, the fear of ditching a familiar friend.  Of course we all know that these are all lies but until the lies are exposed and you experience how much better life is after quitting, these fears stop a lot of people from taking the plunge. The Fear Of SuccessThis video explains how many people are fearful of attempting a quit because they realize that they may actually succeed. The attached videos examine the reasons for this fear and will help smokers to understand that the fears they have of their lives being ruined are based on the false assumption that cigarettes were helping them to live as opposed to recognizing that smoking was ruining their lives in many ways. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhWSOsWoBE&list=PLCDB8BA311D538113&index=9Related videos:Resources explaining interaction between nicotine and stresshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHbpX...Quitting smoking can make you calmer, happier and healthierhttp://youtu.be/7K038NtxO6o"I'll never be as productive again if I quit smoking"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8awQ... The Fear Of RelapsingVideo explains how many people are fearful of even attempting a quit because they are convinced that even if by some miracle they succeed, they will likely lose the quit at some future point in time.

That is awesome MQ!   Something I had not thought of is the fear I would succeed and then how could I go on without my "best friend".   Arghhh.  So happy to not be living that life anymore.
for me...it was all about FEAR  Fear that my life wouldn't be complete without my "friend"Fear that I will never stop cravingFear that I would fail...for the umpteenth timeFear that i wasn't strong enough all fear based I even feared that if I quit....then I would get cancer cause I shocked my body...so silly
I knew I wasn't looking deep enough.    I wasn't skeered until my last hurdle ! Look what I found in my blog,    "Now, at Ten months and change,    craves are strange little thought bubbles that don't belong to me,  EXCEPT  when I try to paint.    That is what I 'do' and it is being a real bugger.What if I can't paint without that junk ? It feels so weird to hold a brush without a smoke.  Plenty of Fear (oh, JOY) to shut down   on this last (or current) no-smoking snafu. I will buck up, quit my special snowflake whining and just get on with it FGS.  This week, I will.  Yep, this week."     and with encouragement from y'all,that week passed and by three weeks fear was a distant memory.Amazing how quickly I forgot !Love that.S   (edited to add)If I hadn't been able to jump that hurdleI would have gone back to smokingbut, by that time it was just breaking a silly habit and the my quit had a life of it's own.Edited September 20, 2018 by Sazeracpunctuation
I was scared to quit, but terrified not to.  Scared to fail-but even more afraid to succeed as I thought that would mean I would be unhappy forever.Everything used to be scary when I was a smoker. I am so glad I was wrong on so many counts.
Bump
 A crave is not a command to smoke.  Just because you feel it, does not mean you need to act on it.  Acknowledge it and move on.   Realizing this made all the difference in my quit.  I stopped fighting and won the battle.  Since then it has been, to borrow a phrase, easy peasy.
    bump
    I've never liked the word "craving" when I quit. To me, a craving means something I want...I did NOT want to smoke. They were only memories. My dying addiction reminding(begging) me that I used to smoke at certian times.    Just NOPE and find something else to do.     
    Is two cheeseburgers, a chicken and bacon sandwich, two ham and cheese toasties, a hunk of cheese, half a glass of wine and a gin and tonic going a bit overboard on the old diet front? Good job I don't have any chocolate. 
    Lol...sounds good to me...what's for afters...
    I've come to bed with a cuppa Doreen, safer when I'm further away from the kitchen. 
    Not if you're hungry! Did you ever suck the jelly out of a jelly doughnut and then fill it with chocolate swirl ice cream?
    No whispers, but now you've given me ideas
    Nah, sounds good to me  ...I couldn't have done it without chocolate tho!!
    Sounds good to me too!  
    It sounds good to me Pumpkin. You've made me hungry.
    Butter popcorn and jelly donut holes have become my comfort foods.  I am even starting to feel the pouch getting bigger.   Quitting smoking and gaining weight really bothered me before.   Now I figured,  if I could give up smoking, I can certainly give up food too.  So I am going to savor it now while I make my quit stronger and then contend with it later!
    Pumpkin, no one is mad at you for enjoying those things.    It appears you have been studying the typical American diet and decided to try it. Awesome      You are doing better than me though - I cannot live without chocolate.
     
On Oct 6 2017 I quit cold turkey. No gum, no patches, vape, weed, pills, nothing.       I had no idea I would still be quit. I remember thinking, "If I make it even a month..."    I mean honestly, who really thinks they will be able to stick with it? it is scary to think of life deprived of tobacco. Like "Damn, so I just do not get to smoke anymore?" Plus all the propaganda about how hard it is to quit, how you NEED NRT, etc. Bullshit. You know what kept me from using NRT? I was not able to afford it at the time PLUS I am too much a cheap skate to pay for something I can do for free.      I never picked up vape because whenever i saw people do it, it looked stupid. Worse than someone carrying a chew-spit bottle, worse than someone smoking a cigarette. I do not like to look stupid.     it does not seem like my daily life is different until i remember things like -     My cigarette break at work is now a hot chocolate break. I don't like coffee. One time at work we ran out of hot chocolate. I am not sure how I survived.   None of my clothes in the past year were ruined because of cigarette cherries randomly falling apart (happens a lot with roll-your-own's, even in a good machine)   My room and house do not smell like a disgusting ash tray. PLUS it is one less fire hazard. I do not feel like I am going to puke half the time. Looking back, cigarettes tasted like crap. It is like one imagines it will be some wonderful sensation but in reality, it was nasty.   No more nasty-ass yellowish film all over everything. Soon after i quit, i took some wall pictures down to clean them and the rags went from white to nasty yellow. No more time wasted sitting there cranking out cigarettes with the top-o-matic machine. Had to make sure I had enough.      But like also my blood pressure has decreased a little since quitting. Doctors say my lungs sound perfect. I can laugh like hell and not have a coughing fit. MY GYOD that was embarrassing to try to laugh and be like "BLAH HACK CHOKE COUGH HACK HOCK WHOAT GURGLE SPAT..." Or trying to fall asleep but being awoken cause my lungs would rattle.  Take a deep breath? For-get it.      How the hell did I not die of smoking? I was one of those who thought smoking was a big joke. I used to call it things like "Having lung sex" or "going out for a roast" or "going out to choke on carbon monoxide" or "ensuring an early grave" or "sexing up the air".        But I thought, "What if I DO die early from this shit? Who will take my place as the forum troll on web places I visit? Where will my room mate live? Who will keep Goodwill in business? Who will keep Pepsico in business? Who will the general public laugh at? They are all depending on me!" I knew it was time to quit.       Now when I see someone smoking, I want to say, "What the heck are you doing? That is nasty!"        Honestly, there are still moments I think I would like one but I do not need that pile of crap back in my life. It's just gross.Edited October 20, 2018 by Jet Black
    BAMMM!  @Jet Black thanks for this hopefull, no-nonsense and honest post.       I love to read these stories. All different approaches, various attitudes towards quitting/methods/life in general. But with one obvious thing in common: proof that quitting smoking is doable AND desirable!      Thanks again             
    A Great post JB....very inspirational to newbies and lurkers....Thanks for posting ...x
    Good for you Jet Black!!    I don't miss the rasping choking laugh either!! Or coughing the large black loogies in the morning.  Man, hindsight on smoking is a kick in the pants...    I'm glad you're free and loving it!
Love this post JB. That 3rd month can be a kicker but you made it through.... and your going to KTQ because you are never going back do do that again.
I mean, it's a saying and all so it must be true. Anywho, I have been smoke free for 8 days now. No excuses, just failed. Missed you all though. Ok. So here's to my final quit.... I hope...
    Hey Girleen,    Welcome home.       A successful quit takes more than 'hope'    but, all that is required your personal commitment to NOPE. This is all, a commitment to NOPE and you cannot fail.      we're here to help you in any way we can    so, stay close to the board and teach yourself again about your nicotine addiction.      
Hi I Got This, congrats on 8 days quit. Take hope out of the equation and let's do this!

    Welcome back. No Hope - Just Nope..... You can do this. So this, which I consider my sticky quit is the the third time I've passed the one week mark.... third's the charm in my case.... it worked for me, lets make it work for you.      You now how important nope is.... you can do this sweetie.... fluids, blood sugar, distraction... you can do this.
Hey stranger    Hell yeah - get 'er done this time. You know the drill. Learn from your mistakes and don't repeat them. You'll be golden  8 days is a great start - almost a week
    Thanks all!! I feel stronger this time around. I'm rolling with it and all the ups and downs. Something feels different this time. This time I'm not so comfortable and gung ho in my quit... I feel I'm constantly walking on egg shells. But in a way it's a good thing.... I'm constantly reminding myself not to smoke.... that I don't smoke.... so far, little by little it's working.
    Welcome (T)!! I've seen your face around and wondered what's up! (If you haven't been to stick of the day in a while...well, I'm sorry) You know the drill tho! Just have to keep on those junkie thoughts...hope to see you around the board!
    Good to see you back.....   Same rules....read all you can ...watch all Joel's videos....knowledge....  And ....Never stick anything in your mouth.... And set it on fire...    Let's make this your sticky quit ..
    Be sure to start reading all the great info. available on this site again. Truly understanding that this addiction is your enemy and not your friend is key to a long term quit. See the addiction for what it is - a killer!
    You’re the active part of the quit, it’s not about hoping and trying  there are many myths around smoking but you’ll see, you’re stronger than you think and you’ll get even stronger with each crave you beat.

I hope...               Don't hope that it is your final quit.  Make it your final quit.        As you know, there is a lot of support here to help you quit for good.  Make the commitment, fight through the craves, and seek help here if needed.        I went through numerous short quits before quitting for good.  That cycle of quitting and relapsing really sucks.  Quit for good and you don't have to go through this again.       Congratulations on 8 smoke free days.  Keep up the great work.  You can quit for good this time.
    I remember one of your quits was either the day before or the day after mine. We talked briefly about it, something about having seats right next to each other on the Quit Train.  You were one of the first people I remember seeing on here. You, Reci, Bakon, Doreen, couple others.        You mentioned in this thread about not feeling so comfortable and gung ho about this quit. I will tell you a little secret - My first few days I thought the same thing, "If I can stay quit, if I make it an entire month..." Things were easy for the first couple months but just about the three month mark, it was hell. I have NO clue why it took so long for the big battle to hit.     I was actually kind of surprised when you quit showing up here, supposedly relapsed. We quit about the same time and you were part of my inspiration to stay quit. It had been a few weeks and I thought, "Other people like this lady quit about the same time I did, so if she can do it, so can I." that might sound weird but it was honestly one of the things that helped my early days.      Because you helped me (whether you realized it or not) I need to ask - is there anything I can say or do that might give you some help?     My personal opinion is that if you made it an entire week, you can do this long haul. Nothing is as bad as the first few days. Well, you got past those so things are going well.
Your 1st. class seat next to JB...is still empty waiting for you....    Sounds like you two...need to travel together....   Buckle up  T.....there may be curves and bumps in the track...but hold tight .you can  do it too...
    Just a quick note to say,  still here, still quit... good days,  bad days but no smoking.   I get here to read quick and get inspiration not much time to comment though... sorry
    Hello Parsley!! Glad all is well! Reward for you!
    Celebrate every day, Parsley !  You are smoke free, yay yay yay.
    Thanks for checking in parsley, you're doing great! 
    Keep strong! You’re doing great! 
    Pretty happy! Many more good days than bad, and now most bad days are really only a few hours.  Really going to be appreciative when the cold hits and I am not out in the freezing temps and wind and snow!!   Happy! Just sayin'
    So here I am, entering day three. Doing ok, only problem is insomnia, which I know is common. Hadn't been sleeping great as it was, so add quitting smoking to the equation and it's a nightmare. Think I had about three hours last night, and four the night before. It's really getting me down. I'm not drinking more caffeine than usual (i drink decaf anyway) nor am I eating loads of sugar. I know it will pass eventually but with everything else going on I need my sleep. Am even debating going to see my doctor .        Anyway, just wanted to have a good moan and feel sorry for myself.      xxx
I got sleeping tablets from my Doctor to help me with that... it really only lasted the first few weeks... I know some people advocate taking the night time cold and flu tablets you can get from the chemist. Only do this if you know you can take them and they wont affect any other medication you might have.        Day 3 is great Pumpkin... well its not its kinda cruddy... but the fact you are still smoke free, that is great. You are getting through the tough part now.
Congratulations on moving to day 3 Pumpkin. Two valuable days in the bag already. The insomnia of the very early stages of quitting is a pain if you experience it. In common with others though around the 2 week mark I started to get the best sleeps I'd had in years.      I was going to suggest cutting down on caffeine as the received wisdom is that you need to half consumption early in a quit, but starting from zero you really have nowhere else to go on that front.       Don't be afraid to ask the doctor for help, I'm certain it won't be the first time they have been asked for assistance in this.         You are doing great, celebrate and keep it going.
    Sorry to hear you're having sleep issues. That really does wear thin pretty quickly. Hope you find a solution to it soon and get some much needed rest. Some of the quit symptoms we have to go through in the early days are certainly annoying but in the end, well worth it considering the benefits you will gain. Freedom from this addiction does not come easily but it is there for all who are strong enough to pay their dues. Fight on Pumpkin! You'll get there  
I agree..having little sleep sucks....in my early quit I was here 24/7....  It does pass...at different rates for each person....   Day 3...all the nicotine has left your body now sweetheart....that's got to be good....
    Thank you all.  Its nice to have you all here.  I'm sitting here at my PC trying to translate this document (about a campsite!) and my eyes are just wanting to close.  I also keep getting a bit lightheaded.  I also remember this from the last time.        I have always been anti-nap in the daytime, but am thinking it might be good for me today.  Then again, maybe I should tough it out.  Stupid thing is I am tired when I go to bed, then as soon as the light goes out, my legs get restless and then I can't sleep, so then I get anxious, then I cry, and then I just get more and more frustrated.        Aaaaghhh!        
    Aww P ...   I would say have a little nap...it will help recharge your batteries.. Be kind to yourself x
    Thanks Doreen       I may also force myself to go for a very short walk by the river.  Hell, I may even do some yoga this evening before bed.    
    Yes. Try anything and everything to get into a new mindset. You never know what might work to relax you a little more.
Good to know your still here!  And... moan all you want.     I had sleep issues as well. It lasted for about 2,5 weeks (but starting after the first week, where I actually slept like a beast). I really hope you'll find something that works for you, to help you through this period. Take care! Edited October 18, 2018 by MLMR
Oh, the sleep! How I missed it! I couldn't force it and standard OTC pills made me...weird: sick, brain fog, worse than quitting did. I just rode it out and would take a couple of 2hr naps at night if that's what it took.   You will find your groove Pumpkin! ETQ!
    Hello Pumpkin,  Sleep when you are tired, rest when you are tired even if you cannot sleep. Do some meditation, actually do a lot of meditation.    Try to relax yourself.  No screens, darkened room, get as comfortable as you can and breathe slow and deep, slower and deeper.  This will help your tissues repair even if you don't sleep.     Congratulations on your quit.   Three days is spectacular and you never have to go through this ever again. Stay close to the board and NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
    So I took a lunch break, went for a walk by the river, and popped in to see a friend.  Hope you like a picture. 
    Love this! The misty reflection on the water is fabulous  Great shot P!
    Love the pic pumpkin, you're doing great  And I agree that maybe you should try to take a nap during the day, at least until the insomnia passes
    You’re doing great. Lack of sleep is one of the nastiest parts of an early quit, I wish it’s back to normal soon! 
    Slept a little better last night. Today was my volunteer afternoon at the animal refuge. Animals always put things into perspective.
    Animals love is a great release of dopamine and serotonin!  Congrats on a new day as a non-smoker Pumpkin! 
    Two Happy Non-Smokers sharing time together ..... love it!
    Well as far as I know Linsie doesn't smoke!
    Happy to see you happy and smoke free !
    You’re awesome! Keep on rocking! 
    Great to see that you are doing so well in your quit, Pumpkin!  Keep up the great work!
    I am having a moment where I feel I have some sort of "control" over my cigarette addiction. Not a lot, but some.
    That's a good thing  Remember that feeling because it will become your new normal the longer you stay quit!      Don't be disappointed if it fades suddenly. That's just part of the process of getting back to normal. Your addiction will try and make you feel insecure still in the hopes you will light one up again. You won't though because you're smoke-free now    That feeling of control, will revisit you more often now as you continue to NOPE!
    Everyday a little progress!     Education and mindset were a big part of gaining control for me. The more educated I became about my addiction, the more I understood the head games of addiction and could confront junkie thoughts head on instead of cowering.   It's a good feeling, take pride, stand on your front porch and scream to the world "I QUIT SMOKING!" because that's how good you should feel!!

    That's awesome Christine, hopefully each day will get better and better  
    It only gets better!
    There’ll come a day when non-smoking is just obvious. You’ll love it 
    I get "hypnogogic jerks" that jolt me awake every time i start to fall asleep. this happens multiple times a night. like a dozen times or more. this has happened all night for the past two nights (of my quit). i have gotten these jolts before randomely, but this is really intense and just seems to get like this when i try to quit. my psychiatrist doesn't seem overly concerned about it. But it is driving me nuts, and i want to sleep.        anyone else have to deal with this?
    Insomnia is a normal part of quitting Christine and if your psychiatrist isn't concerned about it than it's probably just how your body deals. I used an OTC sleep aid, one pill a couple times a week in the beginning just to help my body relax and get some sleep. You may want to ask your dr about doing the same.
I had to get prescription sleeping pills because I had insomnia to start with... so once I quit it was down to 2-4hrs a night... and yep those hypnogogic jerks have been a part of my life forever. It got better.
    I was always a deep sleeper so insomnia after quitting was a shock. It never returned to the previous state, I wake up almost every night. It got truly bad since I moved to this country. 
    about quitting
    Comitting
    ^^that!^^
    I'm not sure i would even know how that feels.      this is like my ninth or tenth attempt. I'm not even sure

I'm not even sure           I was there, blown 2 1/2 year quit and over 10 failed attempts. I'd go go weeks sometimes a few months and blow it. Just saying NO and or replacing smoking with something else. It becomes our crutch when we get triggered, just re-learn how to handle situations without the cigg. NOPE ... Not One Puff Ever is clever and works . You can do it, you just gotta wanna do it

There is something, maybe something here, in Allan Carr videos, on google, a mantra...something will click @christine 12 and it will be your "ta-da" moment.   Mine was a very wise man on a quit smoking forum told me the "only way I'd ever quit smoking is to stop putting cigarettes in my mouth" --duh.  You just keep trying. What is smoking doing for you? Education is important because the only answer is killing you.

You need to re-commit each and every day for quite some time in order to get through and establish a really solid quit.     You can't just wish you could quit. You've gotta REALLY WANT to quit and for an extended period of time.
Wait, didn't we just celebrate your one month smoke free @christine 12?

That's a bummer Christine but when you're truly ready to quit you'll do anything you can to protect each and every day you have smoke free. I stayed close to home the first month or two and only ventured out if my never smoked husband went with me because I didn't trust myself not to cave to a crave. I also was glued 24/7 to my forum, posted a couple SOS's even though my vanity didn't let me actually put SOS in the title. I made sure though to word it so members knew I needed some support and they were there for me.   So when you're truly ready to quit, we'll be there for you too.  So my final answer to what is the hardest part of quitting? It's deciding that you're ready.
    As has been said many times; you just have to want to quit MORE than you want to smoke. And not for just a day or two!
    Comitting is one thing, accepting and embracing everything that comes with it is a second. For me that's the hard part. If I 'just' commit, I become hardened and  solely do it to prove myself that I'm not a ... loser. I don't want to do it like that anymore. After eight weeks (!!!) I find that's its less and less about not smoking, but merely to do things differently. And I love that because I know what I learn now, is for life 
    Looking at the previous quits and this one, I think for me the most difficult part was to change the attitude to smoking. Previously I was feeling and acting as if I was losing something, this time it seems a more conscious decision. That change of mindset was the recipe for success in my case.
    I'm with ela there is wanting freedom and to be quit and there is giving something up and loosing something..... this quit is different because I haven't lost a mate I've freed myself from a prison... that attitude switch from what I was loosing to all I am gaining made a huge difference.... and being present, in your face... everyone saw me quit... everyone read all about it.... I was accountable to them... it was all out there for the world to see.... a lot easier to keep hold of, especially early one, when I was declaring to all and sundry here I am, I have quit... I don't smoke anymore.
    Once you understand the whole cycle of smoking ...and the lies that we are led to believe....   Helps us relax....bla   Helps us calm down ...bla   It's our reward ..bla....bla......bla.....ect.....  Quitting becomes much easier....    This is why reading all you can about this horrible addiction...is the best weapon you can have....you fight it with knowledge...
    Please do not be hard on yourself because a quit will never work if it comes from a dark place. I live around a few cronic quitters and it seems defeating and exausting but...everyone makes their own choices, you know?  You have to change your mindset and figure out what hole smoking is filling up for you. (Most smokers are trying to fill depression/ anxiety) and fill it in another way. You have to separate your quit from all of that.  Your quit is your baby so no matter how you *feel*: you don't feed a baby cigarettes.    
The hardest part, for me, was accepting that I was a Drug Addict.  A veritable JUNKIE.Once I made that leap, I could no longer find comfort in Denial and truth became my motivator.Education led me to acceptance and a commitment to NOPE (as in, Not One Puff EVER NEVER EVER)    Once I copped to being a bona fide nicotine addict and continued my unremitting education about smoking and nicotine addiction,    I became a ferocious NOPE-er and everything got easier.  See 'what is the easiest part...'
Pretty simple - the hardest part of quitting for me was fighting off craves.        I never felt guilt or shame about smoking.  I just got tired of the mess involved like the smell and it was just gross. That and i figured If I wanted to avoid health problems... After age 40 isn't the best time in life to play games with your health.     I guess what helped me hang on to the quit was focusing on the things I didn't like about smoking. I didn't want to spend the money, didn't want to ruin outfits with the smell, didn't want to clean up cigarette butts and ashes.     I do not know your living situation but one thing that might help is avoiding temptation. If you do not live with smokers then that should be easy - just do NOT have any tobacco in the house. Toss the ash trays. Do whatever practical to not remind yourself of smoking. I would say toss the lighters but sometimes those come in handy as they are more of a tool than a smoking thing. But if you must toss them for the time being, if it helps then yeah. Clean up as much evidence of smoking as you can. Like emptying the car ash tray, launder curtains and beddings, maybe all clothes.       If you live with a smoker - try to make whatever arrangements necessary. Maybe they go outside to smoke, maybe they hide their cigarettes from you, whatever.       For me when I quit, i basically had to get it completely out of my life. It was a cleaning project. My room mate does not smoke so that helped.
Three weeks ago, our youngest Corgi, Callum fell ill and we had to rush him to the emergency vet. Turns out he has IHMA, a disease that makes his immune system mistakenly produce antibodies that attack his own red blood cells.  Long story short, he almost died, got a transfusion and now, three weeks (and about $6,000) later, he's on the mend.    All the while, my 14 old boy Tex, has been battling eye disease for about 1.5 years now and is on his last leg. We don't have much time left with him and that's killing me.        In the midst of all this, our other senior Corgi, Ginger had a seizure last Thursday and we had to put her down. There was no saving her...     Needless to say, things have been hard around here and we're struggling to cope, but if I had to find a silver lining, it's that I never -not once- even thought about smoking.     It never even crossed my mind, and if I can deal with all this, I can deal with anything. Smoke Free.       RIP Ginger      NOPE!
    Sorry for your loss Jim.    It's great you have the pride of your freedom from bowing to your addiction to look to for comfort. I know the feeling as I too went through some stressful times this summer and never even considered lighting one up   It's great to reach that point in your quit!
    I'm so sorry, they are family and going through that is tough i imagine. Glad you ddint even think of smoking.          RIP Ginger
    Oh Jim I'm so sorry, our pets are our kids so I know the pain of losing them

Oh, Jim, I am so very, very sorry for all your pain and loss.  We had to say goodbye to our 18 year old Rory a month ago, and my heart is still breaking, and I cry each time I come in our home.  Lots of love, prayers, and understanding coming your way.  And, like you, the good news is that smoking never crossed my mind.
I'm so sorry to hear this, Jim.  It is good that you never thought about smoking but I feel bad for all that you are going through.Edited October 18, 2018 by johnny5
    Any loss is hard and as Jillar said our pets are our fur babies. I am sorry for your loss and the worry of your other two boys.  @Nancy sorry you lost your Rory as well... :hugs 
    I am sorry for your loss    and v. inspired that you have kept your quit.   Be especially kind to yourself right now.
    I am so sorry Jim.  I know your pain.  We lost both our Golden Retrievers within months of each other.  They are more than our pets.  We love them like our children.  Each and every one leave those prints on our hearts.  I hope your young one is finally on the mend and your senior leaves you with many more special moments.  
My condolences, Jim, on the loss of your beautiful corgi, Ginger.....treasure the memories. Sorry to hear your other two furbabies are having issues. Hopefully both will pull through to give you many more memories! It is a lot of heartache to deal with at one time....glad your quit held up successfully!!!   Edited October 18, 2018 by Rozuki
    My condolences, I am terribly sorry for your loss.
    I'm so sad and so sorry for your loss. I  feel your pain as I lost one of my dearly loved fur babies back in March this year.   Thinking of you .
    Prayers.... I'm very sorry to hear of the sad loss of your  fur babies.....they are with us for only a short time ,but ...leave memories that last a lifetime .....
