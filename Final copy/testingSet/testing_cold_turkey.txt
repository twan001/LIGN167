"I woke up in the morning. Stopped smoking, stopped drinking alcohol and started to be a vegan. Drank my first beer 2 months later, quit being a vegan 9 months later. But I never again smoked a cigarette. I don't know why this worked but it did."
Take acid. 
"Planned for a whole year in advance to quit smoking.  Was my Sr. year in college and had gradually increased my intake to nearly a pack a day.  After waking up a few morning gasping for air, decided it was time for a change, but also realized it would be impossible to quit with the stresses and joys of school.  So set a date sometime after that summer to mentally prepare.  And thoroughly ENJOYED smoking for that final year, knowing it would be my last.  "
"1. When you decide you want to quit, get all your cigarettes, ashtrays, lighters (save one for candles if you have to), etc. and throw them all in the trash. Outside your house, preferably right before it's going to be picked up. Just get rid of all of it. Then, if you have energy, vacuum and dust your house and spray air freshener so you don't smell that delicious smokey smell anymore. 
2. Pick up a new ""hands"" hobby. I taught myself to crochet while I watched tv. Something that not only engages your hands but also requires at least some concentration will help you pass time without thinking about needing a smoke. 
3. Use a stop smoking aid if you have to. I used the step-down patches and followed the dosages and times exactly. By the time I was on the last week of the last step I felt fine without them. 
Those are my top three tips. I've been smoke free for seven years this past August. One thing I did that didn't help: Binge-watched Lost. I figured a deserted island wouldn't show anyone smoking. Wrong. (Although this did help me throw out that one last ""emergency"" pack I hid in my desk drawer when I realized I was hoarding cigarettes like Charlie was hoarding cocaine in a tree.) Good luck!"
"Definitely something to fill that oral fixation void. Lollipops, jolly ranchers, gum. 
I kept taking breaks from smoking until I got knocked up. So I’m not the most helpful. "
"Have a heart attack at 35... then be told that the next puff could be your last. At 3 am in the morning 2 days before Christmas.
Haven touched a smoke in 22 years..."
Exercise. I quit cold turkey and took up bike riding. 
You actually have to quit. You can’t just keep cutting back. 
"Don't consider it a failure if you smoke one.  I would have one and think ""oh I fucked it up"" then have a whole pack."
"Start vaping, quoting vape is way easier "
"Haven't smoked since the 23rd of last month. I've smoked for 12 years and it took a throat inflammation to get me to hate cigarettes. 
I decided then that I wouldnt smoke anymore. The pain was not worth it. When I got better, I still hated it as much and reminded myself that it could be a lot worse. 
Kinda worked I guess since I dont crave cigarettes anymore, even when in the compamy of those that smoke. Its all in the mind I suppose, you have to really want to quit, really hate it and feel no joy in it.
Occasionally, I'll smoke weed with some tobacco, but thats about it."
You can wait for the sickening shooting pain radiating down the left arm from a smoking compromised artery. That did it. Cold turkeyed without a problem 27 years ago after a 25 year habit. 
"Vaping.  Ticks all the ""habitual actions"" boxes (except there are different actions required, like keeping batteries charged instead of having a lighter/s + fuel).  There is a reasonable simulacrum of smoke and the feeling is much the same.
The big difference is that you're just warming stuff up in a vaper; not setting light to it.  Burning is - by definition - oxidising and that makes different chemicals.  Lots of them; many of which do not do you any favours."
"Read Allan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Helped my boyfriend and his best friend quit. It has a different perspective and seems unbelievable at first, but it really works"
"Pick a quit date months ahead of time. Not on a holiday or stressful time (my wife kept trying to quit the week before her parents would visit). Gear up for that date. Make it a big event (personally). Have nicotene patches ready. Plus, you have to replace the actual activity of smoking with something else. Especially at those times where you always smoke, like after eating."
"I used Nicorette initially, still getting nicotine but it helps you break the habit of actually smoking. Then I would start doing half a piece with half a piece of regular gum, and eventually just regular gum with no nicorette. I was only ever to fully quit smoking when I quit drinking. Another thing that helped was learning to distract myself with something when a craving hit. They tend to go away after about 5 minutes or so. "
Cardio. Desire to quit. Cardio. 
"Don't thnk ""I quit smoking"", say ""I don't smoke""."
Stop putting cigarettes in your mouth and lighting them.
"Go cold turkey, join an online support group that requires you to check in each day, and exercise.  Lots and lots of exercise.  Eat a ton of food/sweets if you have to and lose the weight after the cravings subside.
Edit:  I'm now going on four years clean and prior to cold turkey I tried Chantix, gum, and weaning but none of it worked.  Only cold turkey and a support group did it for me."
Knowing deep down you want a health lifestyle change for your future. You will only quit when you want to quit.
Take 300ug of LSD and smoke a cig at the peak. The taste of cancer and chemicals will put you off for a good couple months.
"Others have mentioned vaping. That's definitely the 100% easiest way to quit smoking. I switched practically overnight and have been off cigarettes for 3 or 4 years now. I've also seen tons of people who were lifelong smokers switch over to vapes and not go back. 
&#x200B;
Alternatively, I found the patch worked really really well and I was off cigarettes for about a year and a half after using them. As an additional bonus, the patch gives you \_absolutely bonkers\_ dreams."
"I smoked for 7-8 years, quit 18 months ago. 
If you truly *want* to quit, it’s quite doable. Give yourself true blue reasons to quit. You must believe in these reasons. These reasons must be important to you. Then decide on the date, smoke up the rest of your pack, and just stop. 
For me, all I needed to throw into the mix was some exercise. I went for long walks every day. My only difficulty was some irritability on day 3 and a nasty headache on day 4.
My dad quit smoking 20~ years ago, he substituted lollipops for cigs. Might help with the oral fixation thing. "
"Remind yourself you're killing your self every drag you take. Look yourself in the mirror and admit you're probably already at risk of dying of cancer. Don't smoke low nicotine cigs because saying they're ""less addictive"" isn't helping. Don't try to wing yourself off with them. They cause a lung cancer that is more difficult to cure, and they're only low nicotine because there are pin holes near the filter that let air in.  Smell your hands after you smoke, that's how your whole body smells. Stop doing stuff that covers up smoking. Stop whitening ur teeth. Stop using scents to cover it up. Let society effect your life choices. Under this circumstance it's for the better. "
"Not an ad, but JUUL was a game changer for me. I started by just smoking it while at home. Then I cut out smokes while driving. Now I dont smoke real cigs at all. I know these vapes are safe either, but from a pack a day smoker for the last 6 years to none, its been great. Havent had a real cig in about 3 months now. I say Juul only because it was the closest thing to a real cig for me. "
"Don't be too proud to use other nicotine products (patches, gum etc) to help you quit. That's how I did it and it's been over 12 years now. "
"Actually want to quit. Just do it. Sunflower seeds, determination and an unwavering I can do it attitude. Knowing it will only benefit you in the long run."
"I went whole hog on quitting smoking. 
Nicotine patch (stronger than needed , cut in half to save money). 
Gum. 
Vape. 
Pretty much off the patch. Gum's for major cravings, vape just keeps the edge off. 
"
"Quit drinking. For me they went hand in hand. Unlike many smokers I ouldnt stomach more then half a cig without a couple shots in me first. However, once I was on a roll I chain smoked all night. I gave up drinking when my wife got pregnant. It wasn't easy, I did outpatient rehab, twice. I decided to listen to advice and quit smoking at the same time. It was the best decision I ever made. I still get cravings for both, especially while out at night or watching old movies but it's getting easier. I buy better quality food and toys for my kid with the money I save. I'd imagine I'll partake in whiskey and the occasional cigar again when I'm retired but cigarettes are donezo.
Tl:DR if your quitting smoking or drinking quit the other too simultaneously. "
"Noticing a lot of people don't seem down with it, but I suggest vaping. Haven't had a cigarette in over two years, going on strong. I suggest DOING YOUR OWN RESEARCH into it if you are skeptical. 
For the naysayers, no matter how you feel about vaping, you can't deny that switching from inhaling burning vegetation with thousands of added chemicals... To an alternative that is comprised of roughly FIVE chemicals (PG, VG, nicotine, and flavoring) is better. 
I've gained all the benefits of quitting cigarettes, and can still enjoy it. It's also much MUCH cheaper."
"Realize that you actually can't afford to smoke. Between the cost of the cigarettes and the deterioration of your physical health, you cannot afford to smoke, no matter who you are. I quit when I realized how much I was spending a month. Every week I went out to buy a carton of smokes for $60, no matter what else I actually needed or if I could really even afford it. My SO and I quit cold turkey on October 31st, 2016, after addressing our goals for the future and realizing we were not going anywhere if we couldn't save money. We look back now with wiser eyes and regret many other aspects of our addiciton, such as littering cigarette butts on the sidewalk and exposing others to second-hand smoke, but the money was always the main motivator. "
"Smoking is about the addiction to control. Sure the nicatine is the draw and the physical addiction but smoking is less about physical and more mental. 
For me it was meeting my now wife. She didn't like the smell and I liked her more. So I stopped. I wanted to make  her my wife from our 1st date, we picked out our kids names on our second date.
That was 17 years ago. The crazy thing is, there isn't a day  that goes by that I dont want a smoke at some point in the day. Its usually moments that I want to feel control, because that's smoking. It's the repeated sensation of wanting something as much as anything you can imagine and getting it. Each and every time... that's power!
But for me, being with the woman of my dreams and treating her like shes my universe is a more rewarding activity. "
"The biggest thing is truly wanting to quit.  Doing it for someone or something else will probably end if failure, because any break down can quickly lead to sliding right back into it.
As a heavy smoker I tried to quit unsuccessfully several times.  The only time I was successful was when I decided I was done.  I quit cold turkey in 2003."
"I get the A H1-N1 flu. When you get this kind of virus you have to get a Chest X-ray because the Doctors have to see if you have pneumonia or something like that. Three different Doctors asked me if i smoke a lot because it was clearly that I did by just looking at the chest Xray. I went cold turkey after that shit. I spent 10 years smoking at least one package daily and never wanted to quit. My advice is that you really must have the will to it, If you make excuses that the traditional methods don't work Is because you don't really want to quit and you just want magic or a miracle. BTW I always dream that I smoke and I still love/miss smoking but I don't want to smoke never again. "
I started vaping instead. I’ve been able to reduce my nicotine intake from a pack of cigarettes a day to a couple of puffs of the vape a day. Does that count?
"I smoked for six or seven years and came to the realization I don't actually enjoy smoking anymore due to the side effects it was causing, so I threw away the rest of my pack and never bought another.  If you don't buy them or ask for them, you can quit without anything besides willpower. "
Drop acid and think about the reasons you smoke and the reasons you don't want to smoke
"For me, cold turkey (plus chewing gum) was the only way to go. “Slowing down” never helped. 
My parents both went with Nicorette, and still chew it to this day, years after quitting. Still better than smoking!
Twice in my life since quitting, I took up occasional social smoking, and both times, it started getting out of hand, so I’m done with that idiocy now. 
Good luck, and keep trying. A relapse isn’t an excuse to keep smoking for another month or year, it’s an opportunity to try again right now. "
Psilocybe mushrooms. Look it up :) 
Get pregnant. Quit cold turkey the day I saw that positive.
"I quit after 10 years of heavy smoking by purchasing a new car with a leather interior that I wanted to keep in good condition (cigarettes in the car was one of my favorite things to do) and also keeping in mind that I wanted to try to get pregnant that year. Those two things were enough motivation to quit cold turkey, which is honestly the only way to do it, IMO. It's kinda like ripping a band-aid off. It sucks. It's uncomfortable and it's the only thing you'll think of for a few days, but it will eventually get easier.  You know the alternative and it will never get easier, but you can totally do it.
2.5 years smoke free, with an 18m old daughter ❤️"
When you finish your last pack just don’t go into the convenience store to buy another pack.   That’s what i did....but i was also super ready to quit. So that helped with going cold turkey. Now smoking cigarettes makes me sick
"Switched to REALLY cheap, awful cigarettes, by half way through the second carton I couldn't finish them anymore. By the end if it I didnt even want to look at at them."
"I’m on day 12, and it’s probably my 4th time quitting. ACTUALLY PUT THE MONEY INTO A SAVINGS WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT GROW, watching my savings grow is so much more pleasureable than that headrush. I can pay my rent with the money I’m saving ( I’m renting a room)."
"Find something else to do with your hands. I know it sounds stupid, but it really worked for me. "
"Download the Smoke Free app. It shows you all the accumulating rewards of not smoking in real time. I’d never quit over a couple of days previously.
Got up to 5 months using that. I started by having open ALL the time. Then only opened it when I had a craving. Then started opening it just out of curiosity. Saved enough to buy myself a PS4 in a short space of time, which I’d wanted for a very long time.
That app is brilliant."
"Two things prepared me mentally for quitting smoking. Ultimately, successfully quitting smoking is about re-wiring how your brain thinks.
One, I heard similar stories from two people that I know, that don’t know each other. They both said that they quit over 20 years prior, but still would occasionally get cravings. That made me realize that quitting smoking isn’t easy, it is a lifelong battle.
Two, another friend shared how he quit smoking. Every time he lit up a cigarette, regardless of whether he was alone or in a crowd of a thousand people, he would say, out loud, “I am a non-smoker, I do not smoke.” as he was lighting up the cigarette. At first you feel silly, and it just doesn’t sit right, because basically you’re lying to yourself. Eventually, though, it becomes a mantra that you say to yourself to get through the next hour, or 15 minutes, or even the next minute, until the craving passes. And it inevitably does.
I didn’t do it quite every time I lit up, like my friend, but the self imposed Jedi mind trick eventually worked on me too. Sixteen years and counting for me. Every day that goes by adds to the streak, and there better be a goddamn good reason for me to break that streak now. Bottom line, there isn’t one. Can confirm, though, that every once in a blue moon, a craving will still hit me, but they happen less and less frequently the longer you go without, and they get milder and easier to deal with over time. The other guys I mentioned in this reply, by the way, are going on 40, 40 and 30 years smoke free now.
I wish the OP and whoever reading this that’s contemplating quitting the best of success in accomplishing that goal. If I can do it, you can too!
"
"Change of mind-set. Don’t imply your “ giving something up”  or  “quitting”, you start off on the wrong foot by creating a dependency. Instead when you stop that’s that, you stopped an focus instead on the positives of being a non smoker.  It’s worth it. "
"When you quit smoking, also quit drinking for six months.  Then when you start drinking again, start very slowly.  
"
"I used Chantix. I did get the vivid dreams that they warn you about, but it wasn't anything scary. In one of them I was a T-Rex at Disney World and I was having an argument about why I wasn't allowed to ride the Tea Cups ride. I was too big, because I was a T-Rex. Another was me on a cooking show teaching people how to boil an egg, but it was a kinder egg and it went poorly. Most of the dreams were like that, weird and kinda funny, but not scary.
I took the pills for less than 3 weeks, then stopped taking those too. By that point there was no more physical dependency for nicotine, and I had told myself I would never smoke again. And I haven't. It's been over 10 years since I had a cig. "
Buying the brand I don't like did it for me. When it became a bother to go out and smoke one I just kind of gradually lost taste for them. 
"Filling in the habit of when you usually smoke with something else really helped me. For example, if you usually smoke after eating a meal, go take a walk or something.
Also, vaping."
look at the reasons you go for a cigarette and try to change that a little. i found i got most stressed missing my smoke break at work so i went for a break anyways and it made it sooo much better. 
I figured out the best way after smoking for 10 years. First you have to be at that point where you are somewhat disgusted with smoking and feel like you want to quit. Not just randomly quitting. You only want to quit before you go to bed. That evening smoke a lot of really nasty cigarettes. You need to be really disgusted with smoking. Then go to bed sleep 8 or 10 hours wake up you've already got a big head start on clearing it out of your system. Wake up do everything you can possibly do not to smoke. you really won't even feel like having one because of the day before grossing yourself out. Now the real key is in maintaining this not smoking thing never ever have even one single puff of a cigarette don't hang around smokers don't be around smokers don't smell smoke get rid of all the cigarettes ashtrays every single thing related to smoking and don't be around it for 2 weeks at least. I found it takes at least 2 to 3 weeks to really get all the Cravings out of your system then it'll be less and less and instead of trying to survive a day without smoking you'll try and survive a week without it and then a month and then a year I'm going on 20 years not smoking now and I don't miss it. Remember if you have so much as one puff you've given up and you will go back to smoking.
"Carry around a pencil, go outside with your pencil and take the same breaks you would to smoke, but instead of smoking, fiddle with the pencil, even put it in your mouth if so inclined.  It helped me immensely after numerous failed attempts."
"It's been one year for me. Things that have kept me from smoking: 1. Write down why you want to be smoke free. Put it somewhere visible. Reminding myself of long term desires helped me avoid giving into cravings.  2. Tell everyone. Make yourself accountable 3. Now that I can actually smell smoke on others, it truly grosses me out. I still have cravings but the thought of smelling like that again keeps me from buying a pack. "
I used lollies because you can have the same hand motion as a cigarette while sucking them.
Some people say using CBD oil has helped them to stop smoking. Helps to take the edge off of withdrawals.
"This will get buried but if it helps only 1 person it will be worth it.  I was a smoker for 15 years.  In 2018 I decided fuck it, I'm done.  I had tried patches, gum, cold turkey, and vaping before it was a douche sport.  The only one that really worked was Vaping.  I figured now that it was more mainstream it would be easier to obtain the things I needed.  I bought an amazing high wattage Mod with a super douchey huge plume rebuildable vape coil, and tank.  I learned to rebuild my own coils because that is the most expensive part.  To start out I bought 6mg liquid.  I used 6mg liquid for a month until I was no longer craving cigarettes.  Then I went to 3mg liquid for 2 weeks.  At that point I tried to go straight to 0 but found myself craving nicotine.  I started mixing 3mg and 0mg half and half making a 1.5mg liquid.  Used that for 2 weeks and started using 0mg.  I continued using 0mg liquid for all of 3 days before I realized I was no longer craving the nic any longer.  
I stand here today being smoke free and vape free for 6 whole months.  "

"for me it was as simple as accepting that it was just going to suck for a while. once you face that down, that the sucking is just part of it, experiencing it seems a little more routine."
"If you are, ""trying to quit,"" you are not. The urge to smoke isn't going to just go away or get easier unless you just stop smoking already. Like, slow yourself down a bit before quitting, but either you are quitting or you are smoking, there isnt really a, ""trying to quit."""
"First and foremost, you have to want to for your own reasons.  The chances of quitting for someone else is slim, in my opinion.  I smoked for 20 years, and finally decided to quit.  I went cold turkey, and simply stopped buying them.  It was tough, especially considering everyone I worked with smoked.  You just have to want it.  When the urge comes, find something to occupy yourself with. It only lasts a few minutes and gets easier each time.  Lastly, good luck."
"As long as you stay true to reduced the nicotine content as you go, vaping is a great way to start. "
"Not having cigarettes around is a big one, I would always break if I knew there were some around. Then just white knuckling and distracting myself through the cravings, they got less intense after a few weeks. Vaping helped as I missed the physical side of actually having a smoke break. Bar a few sneaky smokes when drinking, has been 3 years off them. Watching my dad die from lung cancer helps me stay off them too, very stark reminder of the consequences"
"I know this isn't applicable to everyone and it wouldn't be easy in a financial sense, but for me what made it easy was going on a two week vacation for Christmas with my family (including my grandparents). Being surrounded by people that not only didn't smoke, but frowned upon it heavily made it almost completely undesirable to even try. The two weeks was enough time for me to lose my appetite for smoking (I had wanted to quit for a while anyway). Before that I smoked about half a pack a day. So I guess my advice would be to put yourself in a situation that makes it very uncomfortable to smoke (in a social sense) if at all possible. "
"Buy the cheapest, nastiest god damned cigarettes you can. 
Then you’ll likely smoke less, and may not even finish it when you do. 
Then remind yourself it’s disgusting and you could spend all that saved money on blow. 
Boom, quit 7 years ago. "
"Patch, the largest one and will power after 6 weeks"
"Vape all you want first. Keep doing that, but drop your nicotine levels until you reach zero. Keep vaping all you want for months. Then, cold turkey or ween off."
"My last cigarette was 10 minutes before my heart attack. I don't recommend doing it that way, but it does work."
"Stop buying cigarettes.  Out of sight, out of mind.  Also I liked using Blow Pops as a craving alternative."
Never got beyond 2 packs a week but eventually I moved out of the place I was living where I had roommate smokers into a new place with a non smoking roommate. I used an e-cig and the highest concentration of nicotine liquid that brand provided. Over the course of several months I slowly reduced the nicotine concentration in the liquid I was buying until I eventually was using 0%. I backslid a few times during this process but I eventually got to a point where I wasn’t using nicotine but was still able to trick my body by going through the motions. I stayed at that point for a while until I eventually looked at the cost and how it kept going up and decided to stop buying more stuff when say the batteries or refill containers broke. At this point I still have some e-cig materials so if I ever have a craving I can use them but haven’t touched them in about 6 months
"You just have to do it. Don't baby yourself. Don't cheat or you will fail. Get it in your head, you're quitting. You are quitting. Make up your mind and do it. Make up your mind to quit, resist the urges. Make up your mind. Decide to quit and follow through. "
Vaping CBD
"Whenever you're hit by a craving, get up and run some flights of stairs, or go for a brisk walk. Get winded. It will remind you of why you quit, distract you, and being short of breath will make smoking feel undesirable."
"I used chantix.
&#x200B;
once I quit with it for about 6 months, but I was still around a lot of smokers especially while shooting on a billiards league.
&#x200B;
the last time, I used chantix again, this time I went through the full recommend routine, the first time I only did the starting part. it  was somewhat tough to tolerate this time at times, but about 6 years later I am still smoke free.
&#x200B;
another thing for me, I always got agitated when people would ask me about it, so I never told anyone not even my wife, except for my boss I also told him I was taking chantix and that I didn't want him to bring it up unless he noticed concerning ""changes"" of mood etc.
&#x200B;
no one knowing I was trying really relieved the pressure to quit and just let me quit.
&#x200B;
I had also tried wellbutrin a little while before even my first bout of chantix, but that shit made me an emotionless zombie, I didn't like it.
&#x200B;
but like they say, chantix, after about a week of taking it you don't get anything out of a cigarette anymore, you can smoke and smoke but you never get that ""reward"" feeling, it starts to just feel pointless, and starts to taste like garbage. you still have to want to quit, but it helped me immensely."
You have to want to quit. If you don't really want to quit you'll never quit. You have to make cigarettes seem like the grossest thing on Earth to you. Good luck. 
"I read a book that changed my life. It's called ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" by Allen Carr. I swear, I never thought just reading a book would ever help me stop smoking ... but it did. Had my last cigarette on July 31, 2011. "
Have a reason to quit.
"I smoked for 16 years, 2 packs of Reds a day, and quit completely cold turkey in 2013. My best two suggestions are to find a few hobbies that can take up your downtime (video games helped me), and to buy some presents for your loved ones as you go because you are going to be a prick for about 3 months. "
"Took a drag one day and said ""this is stupid"" and never touched it again"
"14 months.
Conciously feel the effects on your body, throat , lungs, breathing capacity.
Combine that with exercise and meditation.
The human body aren't made for smoke in the respiratory system."
"Do it today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Stressful day? Doesnt matter. Fuck you. Stop now. Nut up, stop being a bitch and put it down. It's the most addictive thing on planet earth and no one is going to stop you but yourself. Take some self accountability and just do it this fuckin second. None of this ""I'll just finish this pack"" ""I'll just have one more, a final goodbye"". No. Now. That's what I did. I got sick from withdrawals for two weeks. I pushed through. I got it done. I got over it. Its behind me. "
"My method;
 
I took my last pack of cigarettes and literally taped it to the wall, and wrote on it ""I give up"".  It was in plain sight of everyone in my house.
 
Only rule was that the next time I smoked, it had to be out of that pack.  I could smoke at any time I wanted... I just had to admit to myself and everyone else that it beat me.  That pack is in a box somewhere in storage never opened.
 
It was miserable.  Don't let anyone tell you it won't be... fuck every day for a long time.
 
And it doesn't ever fully go away.  It's been a decade and I won't lie, I'd take a smoke now if I knew it wouldn't get me hooked again (and it wouldn't burn my throat and lungs).  
 
And the health changes aren't the night and day 'amazing' drama people make it out to be.  I didn't suddenly become a gymnast, I just get winded a bit slower and have a MUCH lower chance of getting cancer.
 
So don't expect magic, expect reality.  
 
You should quit.  And it's going to suck.  But if you don't odds are, it's going to suck worse."
wellbutrin!
"Assuming NRT wouldn't work for you, go cold turkey. Every cigarette you don't smoke is a success, don't focus on fighting any craving other than the one you're suffering. You can't beat every craving you will ever have in one shot, but you sure as hell can take them on easy individually. Quitting was easier than expected with this method."
You'll only be able to quit if you really want to.  From my experience there are no real tricks
"Most smokers die from smoking related illness. Chew on that for a bit. It is to hard to quit for someone else, you have to do it for yourself. Get help, cancer societies in most countries in the world have smoking cessation programs. I watched my mom and sister both die from lung cancer. Worked for me, and in hind site i don't know why it was such a big deal to quit. The only rule is you must never have a puff, no cheating. Just like booze, one smoke or drink and you are hooked. "
"My mam is an ex-smoker (close to 15 a day at the worst) and she red a small book by Paul McKenna, some hypnotist guy. She read the book in one night and basically quit the next day. Took her about a week to leave the cravings alltogether."
"It honestly boils down to wanting it bad enough. One day I had trouble breathing after walking to work like 50 ft from my house and knew it was time to stop. 
Also not quitting cold Turkey. I used a combination of e cigarettes, meditation, and weaning.
I also started going on daily walks which kept me busy and feeling good.
another thing I did was designate times to smoke. No cigarettes an hour before and after the gym. No cigarettes 2 hours after waking up and an hour before bed."
"Be petty as fuck and use the fact that someone hid your cigarettes to quit smoking out of pure spite.  
Worked for me anyway. "
The thing that did it for me was one of those Truth commercials. “So...cigarettes definitely cause cancer.” I don’t know why but it clicked with me and I quit cold turkey. Every time I wanted one I’d think “but they definitely cause cancer” 
"I smoked for 25 years. I quit a few times, always the same way, but having everyone around you smoking all the time makes it difficult. I would basically ramp down my smoking, stretching out the periods between cigarettes from hours to days, until I simply didn't feel the need to smoke and would just stop. I personally found it easier than just going straight cold turkey.
The last time I quit was for good. I bought a vape and haven't had a cigarette since. I did try smoking one cigarette about 3 months in, had two drags and said ""fuck that"" as it was disgusting. That was almost 5 years ago, and my lungs are much happier (it only takes a few weeks and you should start noticing the difference, which really helps motivate you). I believe the hardest parts of quitting for many people are the social aspect (I want to hang out with my friends, but what do I do while they smoke? and the physical addiction (what do I do with my hands?!). I found a vape takes care of both of those issues. Having said that, whatever works for you is what you should do. Don't give up...if something doesn't work, try something else. Keep your eyes on the goal, and keep thinking about all the benefits of not smoking."
"1. Don't be around smokers
2. Keep in mind that it's not as hard as people say it is. Big tobacco nurtured that thought to their own ends
3. I started quitting when I got a bad cold and couldn't even look at a cigarette, gave me a little jump start for the first few days
4. Probably the most important part is that there will come a time when you just won't even think about it anymore and it will become nasty again, very nasty"
"My dad stopped for a while but when he started  back up, he said it was because it was part of his routine with work. He worked on cell towers so he would sit in his truck, work on programming and smoke cigarettes. Hos mother died at 60 because she smoked and his father was on hai way into the grave when he got brain cancer."
Juul
"Cold Fucking turkey. It’ll suck for a week or two but once you get past it, the very smell of a smoke will make you want to puke. 
It also helps having a parent dying of COPD. "
Vape.
"Vape, and also just thinking about what you’re doing while you’re doing it.  I noticed that when I smoked i didn’t like stop to think about the taste or how it felt. If you stop to think about it while you smoke you’ll realize itll become gross"
"If you have the will to quit then don’t go to the store for two days. Make sure you are good on gas. Change up everything for two days at least. You see smoking is just a habit so you need to completely break the cycle by not doing the typical stuff that lead you to smoking that cigaret on that hour. Go on a trip or distract yourself with friends and family. Go over and spend time with them. Lastly my last tip is to just stop thinking negatively. If you can go one week, you are free. That’s it! You can go another week and another week for the rest of your life but you need to get over the first big hill. The first 24 might not be the best but after you’ll realize this shit is easy. You might have a urge here and there but nothing like before. Those urges are usually fade quickly. Good Luck and it’s 100% possible. I’ve been smoke free for 2 months."
"I got way too drunk and smoked way more than i normally do in a night and felt miserable the next day from hangover and the gross ""i smoked too much last night"" feeling. I was 26 and that was 3 years ago. Never got over that. Felt sick and nauseous and could feel that gross and hungover feeling any time i thought about smoking. Just never felt like smoking again after that. After a month or two i felt so different. "
"Everytime you want a smoke, think about all the negative things smoking brings you. In the first week I would say them out loud.
Please note that smoking has nothing positive. Even if you think it helps you in stress situations to calm down, this is not true! You give your body stress when smoking. What does help is stepping out of a stressfull situation for 5 to 10 minutes. 
Also, gaining a bit of weight is still a lot healthier then keeping up with smoking.
Also, i put all the money aside that i did not spend on sigarets, and bought myself a new laptop after 9 months... 
Good luck!! "
Buy somethibg that you REALLY want but can't afford if you also have to buy cigarettes . Worked for me.
"And after you've quit: you can never ever ever smoke anything else ever again. A joint - nope. Using a smoking pipe? Nope. I quit for 2.5 years. Cold turkey. Then shared a joint with a friend. Then wanted to share another the next week. You see where this is going. That tiny bit of tobacco is all you need. But it's also the *feeling* of smoke in your lungs. That's why the tobacco-free smoking pipe has to stay off limits forever as well.
STAY QUIT."
"I used to talk mad shit, but vaping really, really helped. "
"I smoked a pack a day till I was 29 and quit cold turkey.
The last day I smoked I got drunk and smoked like a chimney all night . When I woke up the next day hungover as shit, I was sick as a dog so the first day was relatively easy. 
Day two wasn’t so easy
Day three... fucking horrible.. felt like I was getting stabbed in the stomach from withdrawal.  
Every day after that till about 3 months was difficult. Now, 22 years later, it’s not even a thought in my head.
You HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT.. that’s the key
I hope it works out if you try"
"I used the patch and also smoked weed.  It worked.  I was a heavy smoker too (a pack a day).  Weed is not addictive, so you're not really replacing one addiction with another.
Also, any time I had a craving, I thought about all the bad things related to smoking, like getting cancer, smelling like shit, lung pain, the cost of cigarettes, the wasted time, etc.  It helped reduce or eliminate the craving."
trees
I used nicorette for a few months. It was almost like cheating. I never slipped up once
Some might disagree but vaping helps some people and is a healthier alternative. The research is still a little shakey on the long term side affects since its a Farley new trend. 
I tried everything but Chantix is the only thing that worked for me. 15 year smoker quit in 1 month with it and haven’t had a cigarette in 10 years.
"Not the Juul! Whatever you do, not the Juul. Made me twice as addicted to nicotine. What got me to actually quit cigs was an acid trip and hula hooping. "
"If you listen to Jordan Peterson... you'll have to believe in god and then take magic mushrooms and have a mystical experience. Then, and only then, can you quit smoking."
"I switched to a vape for a while, the main encouragement to keep going was my bank statements, and having an extra $70 every week. It's been about 3 months at this point, and every gas station I pass the thought crosses my kind to stop in and buy a pack, but then I just smell my shirt, and touch my wallet and keep driving. "
"Chantix, the only thing that worked. previously (and unsuccesfuly) I tried in chronological order:
1) Nicorette gum
2) Patches
3) Cold turkey + Licorise
4) Laser accupuncture, total bullshit but amazingly worked for a few days, like a placebo I guess
&#x200B;
and then Chantix. Since then I had several relapses and always ended it with Chantix.

"Don't feel like you're ""giving up"" something, you'll gain vitality, sense of taste and smell, independence, all while saving money. Plus, not getting lung cancer is pretty nice too.
Key to all addictions is to figure out what to do INSTEAD of your addictive behaviour. What will you do when waiting at the bus station, or after lunch or in a work break? Bring a rubber band and play with that, or solve a quick puzzle on your phone, or whatever, just have something.
For a few weeks, at least. After that, the idea that you could smoke won't pop up in your head any more anyways.
*Edit:* Also, if you just feel you *should* quit smoking, don't even try. If you don't actually *want* to, you won't. Just figure out if you want to be a smoker or a non-smoker, and whatever it is, you can become in this very moment.

"Just do it
Srsly if you want to quit then you can quit
No bullshit just a last cig 
Quit now 
Keep your mouth busy for th first few days with those little wooden toothpicks or so "
Really wanting it. I know it's bullshit answer but that's the difference compared to my other half ass attempts. 29 days until my one year.
"Smoke free since Spring 2016. My one piece of advice is quit. That's it. You have to want to quit. I loved smoking, I still miss it to this day, but I just thought to myself I'd hate to get to 50, 60 or beyond if I'm blessed to make old age and I can't keep up with my grand kids because my lungs are falling to bits from smoking all my life. You really have to really think ahead. Just imagine how happy your future self will be that you quit all those years ago. I also used a vape (e-cig) with nicotine to help ease the burden, massive help. Over time I've lowered the nicotine to the now were I have 0mg of nicotine and now I barely use my vape, only in social environments when people are smoking (usually nights out)."
"Well, I suppose I can tell you how I did it. I'm actually really hung up on getting closure on things, as most people are, so what I did was to make the whole thing into an occasion.
It all started with me, on a late Sunday afternoon, realizing I'm almost out of cigarettes. As I stared at the pack I saw there was only one left after I pulled out my after-meal smoke, and like a brick wall it hit me that ""why not the last ever?"" That's when I decided that the next morning I would smoke my last-ever cigarette.
That night I pre-loaded the coffee maker. I tracked down and changed the batteries on this little whisker thing for foaming your milk. I cleaned and put up the hammock and placed a log next to it as a table. I made every effort I could think of to have as comfortable a morning as possible the next day.
So I live in a rural area. The mornings are really nice, but if I just wake up for work I don't really appreciate anything, let alone the little things like crispy air, cozy mist, the sun rising and bird songs. So I woke up early. I started up the coffee and took a long, steaming-hot shower. Forgot to heat the milk before whisking so I accomplished nothing there, but didn't really care because it was a lovely morning and the coffee tasted great anyway. Grabbed an old issue of White Dwarf from my youth on my way out, and enjoyed the hell out of everything.
I was in a good mood the whole day. Think it's about five years ago now, went cold-turkey and haven't really thought about it since."
I pictured my cravings as a child.  They would cry and throw tantrums.  I would send them to their room.  Tough love. 
"For those considering quitting cannabis, I highly recommend r/leaves. "
"Do it for you, no one else. You have to WANT to quit."
"Try Chantix. You may be one of the lucky ones that have little to no bad side effects, as I was. That's how I quit."
When I quit smoking I started drinking. Only problem was whenever I drink i crave cigarettes. So I quit drinking and replaced that with coffee. And now I can’t sleep so I don’t know what to do. 
"1) You have to have *decided* you don't want to smoke any more. This can only come from your own brain - people can influence you, and that is helpful to get you along the parh, but at the end of the day the choice has to be yours.
2) Use a tracking app to keep track of days not amoked, money saved, health gained... etc. I used ""Smoke Free"" and it was a fantastic way to conceptualize what I was gaining every day by choosing not to smoke.
3) Jump on r/stopsmoking, and realize just how not alone you are.
4) Excercise!!"
"Vape. One year without smoking. Even the first week was okay. You need to find a shop that help people quit smoking rather than the trend for flavoured dense foggy shit.
Salesman has to provide you a liquid that fits your needs regarding your nicotine consumption and a machine that deliver the right amount of smoke/vape that you can bear and that feels like your way of smoking.
If Im in a good way to stop everything, and I am, you have lot of chances to quit too.
"
"After many failed attempts, I finally quit for good in 2001.  First, you have to have a sincere desire to quit. Second, change one habit that triggers a craving. For me, I quit getting a cup of coffee for my drive to work.  When someone asks you if want a smoke, remove the word ""try"" from your response.  Instead of saying l'm trying to quit, say no thanks, I quit.  It might sound dumb, but it reenforces your decision to quit.  Lastly, it takes a about two weeks to get over the physical craving for nicotine. If you can go two weeks, you can succeed.  Good luck. 
"
"Someone I know did this: 
Get a locked money box and start filling it up with what you would have spent on ciggies every day. Have a target in mind of what you're saving up to buy yourself with this money."
"Have a good reason to quit or something to quit for.  Without that something or reason, you will fail...and fail you will.  It took me a good 7 to 10 times before it stuck.  Been smoke free for 11 years now, hardest thing Ive ever done.  Dont give up."
This obviously isn’t the best solution but I just started smoking pot instead. When ever I’d get a craving I’d just smoke a joint and forget the craving!  
"I kept remembering someone telling me that after 3 days the headaches and physical urges really die down and it becomes a lot easier. After 3 days I found this to be true and it was much easier from then on out. Kind of like accomplishing one goal, then onto the next mentality.
&#x200B;
The hardest part is the *habit* of smoking, not the addiction, at least for me. Like longer car rides, down times at work, after drinking, at parties, that sort of stuff. Powering through that kind of urge will always be a struggle, but it does get easier over time. Replacing it with other activities like exercising really did help."
It’s not just one big decision to quit. You have to decide to quit minute by minute at first... then it’s hour by hour and then day by day... eventually you don’t have to make the decision consciously anymore. 
"E-cig. Gradually step down to zero nicotine, and then no ecig."
Don't 
Persevere. I went from around 30 a day to cold turkey. Fell off the wagon a couple of times but then the days with out smoking got longer. Have now not smoked for over 13 years. I still get cravings every now and again but the smoking days are gone.
"First, good for you for wanting to give it a(nother) try! I wish you all the luck in the world, and feel free to message me if you need help! A couple things worked for me. First and most important, you have to be ready. Like actually ready to make a major lifestyle change. Second do not use replacements! I tried gum, patches, vapes, everything, but the only thing that worked for me is just stopping... cold turkey. Third, realize that it’s not a one time decision. Every time you light a cigarette you make a decision to smoke. Same idea, but way harder. For the first few months you will constantly make the decision to not smoke. Every 5-10 minutes you will get a craving, so be prepared for the temptation numerous times per hour. Fourth, I did not throw away my open pack of cigarettes or my lighters. I realized this time that it is likely I would cheat, so knowing I had that as an option if I really needed it was a mental comfort. I didn’t use it, but knowing it was there helped. Most important, was to keep myself busy constantly for the first week or so. I vacuumed the house a couple times a day, I washed my car every day, I did laundry, I took the dog for a walk, I pulled weeds, I did everything I could possibly think of to keep my hands and mind busy while my cravings were the worst. It worked for me, but it is not easy! Last cigarette was August 31, 2010."
I got a vape then slowly lowered the nicotine level. I haven’t smoked a cigarette since June of 2016. It really works. My husband (2 packs a day) quit that was as well over a year ago.
"What did it for me was
1) No smoking inside the house. It meant going out to the balcony freezing my balls off every time I wanted a cig. That made it lose part of the appeal big time
2) Less stress. Sounds obvious but honestly part of  my craving triggers were stress. When I changed jobs I cut my daily cigs from 20 to 10 in a single day. That was a big wake up call
3) Decided that my aim was to smoke less every day, not ""quit"" so if I wanted the one cig, I'd just have it and not take it as a failure. Also I'd just tell people I was trying to cut down instead of quitting so if they ever saw me smoking I wouldn't have to put up with them telling me stuff like ""oh that's too bad you were doin so well"" blablabla"
"Honestly, decide it for yourself, you’ll stick to it. I decided twice for my girlfriend and it never worked, one day, went upstairs in a building and thought to myself “are you gonna be that guy that can’t talk to your customers cuz there was like 12 steps ?” That night, I had the last one, it was a year ago (09/19) "
Use a vape to ween down on the nicotine. Gives you a way to inhale while controlling your intake. Eventually just vaping juice with no nicotine and stopping altogether
"I used to smoke a pack a day. 
I know reddit tends to hate on vapes, but it feels to me that their original intention was to help people quit smoking. Vape shops will offer the nicotine juice in various flavors and concentrations. 
I quit smoking by buying a vape with a flavor I enjoyed, and I high nicotine concentration. The only problem was, I was then addicted to vaping. 
To quit vaping, I gradually lowered the concentration of the juice I bought until it was almost zero (you can accomplish this by buying a zero concentration and mixing it with a low concentration). Then, I switched flavors to something I DID NOT LIKE.  That way, I was only tempted to use the vape when I was really craving nicotine. Eventually, you grow to despise the taste so much, it becomes unappealing and you quit all together. 
I understand the health effects of vaping have not been studied as extensively as tobacco use. However, this is a shorter term solution than any others I have seen, and is the only way I was able to quite. I haven’t had a cigarette in three and a half years. 
Hope it helps! "
Stop buying cigarettes. Quit 5 years ago and never looked back.
"1. Want to quit
2. Separate yourself from situations, especially social ones, where you are tempted to smoke. This was key for me. My friends were all smokers and it was too enabling when they would all take smoke breaks. This is the hardest part for most people imo. I only quit after I moved to a different city for other reasons.
3. I did not quit cold turkey. I took about a month or so to wean myself. I would stave off the temptation a long as possible throughout the day. After a few weeks I was down to one cigarette at the end of the day. Then I would smoke half a cigarette a day. At that point it was easy to quit.
I only smoked for 2-3 years and I quit ~8 years ago. I still have dreams where I start up smoking again."
Bubblegum. Have cravings? chew one. Having craving again while chewing gum? Chew another one and another. And another.
"I used Chantix.  After a few days of taking it and not smoking, the thought of smoking made me sick.  I still dream of having a cigarette, and in the dream it’s the best thing ever, but when I wake up, I feel nauseated.  "
"I want to quit, but I also don't want to go without it.. "
Ex-smoker for 2 years. I started with going down with the everyday dosage until I mustered the will to finally stop. The best tip I have is making it hard for yourself to be able to smoke and also telling a close friend/relative to help you stop the craving.
"Keep on quitting! Quit every new years, quit every birthday, every new moon, every first of the month, every monday and every day. One Monday will be that lucky one where it will work. Just never give up.
People tried to tell me naahh that will just make you feel like a failure every time and you quit quitting but there must be 2 kind of people in the world.
Conquer one addiction at a time. "
"Just.  Keep.  Quitting. 
It takes time, effort and persistence, and it won't go right the first time.  That doesn't mean anything is wrong.  Just.  Keep.  Quitting."
"A lot of good advice in here already. For me, limiting my time around people who are actively smoking helps a lot. At some point in your journey to quitting you'll find yourself hanging around friends having a good time and have a quiet realisation that a smoke won't make you feel better right now, which is honestly the best piece of encouragement I have had. "
"If you happen to move house, take that opportunity. I tried so many times and it was quitting when I moved that finally did it. My new deck wasn’t a smoke spot like the old one, it was a just a deck, because I never let myself smoke at the new place.
Smoke free for three or four years now."
"Read Alan Carr's EasyWay.
Everyone I know who's actually finished the whole book has successfully quit. I have a bunch of friend who stopped reading it because they knew they'd stop if they read to the end. What a bunch of idiots"
"I just started mass consuming bananas. Friends having a smoke, have a banana. I used to buy the 6 packs and carry them around"
"I quit many years ago by simply cutting my smoking in half every week until I was down to less than one cigarette a day. You can cut down at whatever rate you want, half every week was just what I used. Started out at 30 a day (a LOT of cigarettes!!) cut down to 15, the next week 7 a day, and so on and so on. I had started out at a pack and a half, so it took me a while but it didn't feel as daunting as quitting cold turkey and by the time I got down to one or two drags of a cigarette a day smoking had become more of a hassle than something I looked forward to.
When I got down to that level I went on a long hike into the wilds with some friends. I was a day and a half hike away from cigarettes for a week and a half. It was so beautiful and I was working hard physically every day so I didn't miss cigarettes at all. By the time I got back from the hike I had lost all interest in smoking.
Best decision I ever made, and I am happy I stuck with it. My health is so much better now, I have more money and a lot less social stigma. Just do it. It's so worth the effort. You can do it. When I began that process of quitting, I was someone who *loved* smoking, and I had no faith in my ability to quit. I thought it was going to be impossible because I didn't really want to quit. But here I am 20 years later and still smoke free. If I can quit, anyone can."
Find that circumstances where you most commonly smoked. Slowly work  out the habit during those. The tough part for me was when I drove. I used to always smoke when I drove. To and from work. To the store. Across the state. Always when I drove. And it was in that setting that it was the hardest to kick. I now chew gum when I drive. Or munch on sunflower seeds for long drives. It did the trick.
"I smoked for 15 years and was almost up to 2 packs a day.  I used the gum, worked fairly well but it isnt for everyone. "
Try cigars. A lot less harmful and doesn't kill the lungs.
"Alan Carr's easy way to quit smoking helped me get into the mindset.
I went cold turkey for a year and three months and then I smoked a cigarette when Trump was elected, and then here a there afterward, usually when drinking, but those cigs just cemented that they're not really fun since they made me feel terrible right after. I can't remember my last one, or drag. Probably spring. "
My only tip is get a vaporizer and some juice you like then ween yourself off of that. Only thing that worked for me.
"Some perspective. I was a smoker for 20 years before I was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. I'm sure my smoking had a lot to do with the diagnosis. Anyway, I was told by the doctors that I needed to quit smoking right away. I tried in the past with no success, but when so much is on the line it makes it much easier. As a matter of fact, I haven't had a cigarette since even though I still miss the taste. My point is, if you need to quit it's easy, so the want to quit has to be strong. Vaping helped with the transition for sure. I'd recommend vaping to anyone who wants to stop smoking. You can progressively dial down the nicotine and once you're at 0% nicotine, just stop vaping. "
"I quit ten years ago cold turkey. After repeated attempts the final time was was ironically the easiest. I didn't just quit smoking, but to also changed my daily routine.
You know, morning coffee and a smoke? Don't just skip the smoke. Skip that coffee too! Get some juice, cereal or whatever, and have it in a different manner than you did with the coffee and smoke. Smoke a lot when having a drink out at a bar? Don't drink or go to the bar for a few months to remove that temptation. Love that after meal smoke? Have an after meal espresso instead!
I had the added advantage of changing jobs which was able to give me a new commute as well as a new routine at work. Together it made quitting smoking 100x easier than all the previous attempts. 
Smoking is half routine and half addiction. Change your routine to help yourself quit."
"I pretended quitting was easy to impress a girl who wouldn’t date me because I smoked.  I tossed out my smokes in front of her to show her how I was serious. She bought it and we ended up dating for 2 years. 
Once I did it I was pretty much committed at that point. The first few days were tough but I just focused on the sex and that it was worth it. "
"Drink juice and eat candy. Juice acidifies your urine and makes you excrete nicotine faster. Candy helps keep your oral fixation occupied. Both will help with blood sugar levels, which smokers often don't realize will tank when you quit smoking because nicotine releases blood sugar and without it you actually have to eat. "
Read the article about Mr. Rogers movie sound man. 
Tell yourself in your mind over and over that you are stronger than cigarettes.
"I would quit for months , smoke socially at a party and then slowly begin smoking more and more . This has been my pattern for years . Finally quit with a free app .  "
"Whenever I had the urge to smoke I would replay the line from Labyrinth in my head, ""you have no power over me"".  Worked for me since I hated the feeling of needing something that bad."
"Do not have a last cigarette.  Just quit on the spot.
Smoking weed every night helps too. "
Ummm mobile games.  I spent all my cig money on mobile games for like 6 months .... now im trying to start smoking again to save some money.
"Throw away whatever pack you currently have without finishing it. It's too easy to say ""I'll do it just after this"" for years.
Then, just don't buy another one. After the withdrawal, you're free. Cold turkey takes a little will power and like 2 weeks time, then you're free.
Also, it's helpful to remember the cost. If you're a pack a day smoker, and let's say your brand is $5 each (estimate, obviously depends on brand and area) then you save 5*365=$1825 a year! I'm sure you can think of some cool stuff to do with an extra $1.8k!
You got this, go for it!"
When smoking hand rolled - do something with your hands. I did it with a green biro ( learn to spin it!) plus peeling satsumas.
"Full stop, cold turkey. I used sunflower seeds to help the cravings. You will gain weight, a good chunk of people do when they quit. 
Fuck patches, fuck gum, just find something to curb the craving and kick that shit. "
Had a mental breakdown and smoking cigs actually makes you more susceptible to that happening. Cigs also give you anxiety. Do hard cardio that naturally make release feel good endorphins in your brain. Nothing good ever happens for feeling sorry for yourself! best of luck !!!
"Hey OP, I had been tired of smoking for years and decided that I would orally take e-juice to supplement the nicotine while my oral fixation dwindled. So far I've gone 2 months with no cigarettes and only dose 2-3 times a day. I plan on being off nicotine in a couple weeks. Hope this helps! 
Oh. Btw I use 6mg e juice."
"SO found our 2yo playing with his packet of cigarettes and that was a wake up call. He is now a ""social smoker"" only smokes once a month when he's at the pub. Saves $200pw (they're really expensive in New Zealand) I've never pressured him to quit and v. proud he took the initiative. Also setting realistic expectations helps. "
"Speaking from my own experience, dont try to quit until you have 100% made up your mind that you are going to quit. Its way too easy to slip back into the habit if you arent 100% commited mentally to do it. 
Let those you value around you know that you have quit and roughly how long its been because mood swings are very common; it may help them be more forgiving when/if you're a dick to them.
Try to pick up another habit to occupy the time. I switched up to going outside and doing push ups and quick exercise. For those with the oral fixation, try using flosser picks/toothpick as an alternative healthy habit. 
Good luck and believe in yourself and your health!"
"I'm not a smoker, but my brother quit cold turkey one particularly brutal summer in college when his dorm AC went out.  He decided that being heat-miserable would take his mind off of cigarettes.  He said that it definitely made a huge difference for him, and made it much easier to quit.  
So those people wanting to quit... if you don't mind being hot for a few weeks, shut your HVAC down next summer and see if it works for you.  "
I quit smoking long before vaping was a thing. What I did was smoke sage.
"Foreword: I'm too lazy to read any of the other replies. 
Continuing: Switch to american spirits. 
I used to smoke marlboros and newports and they were hard af to quit (especially menthol cigs). I switched to american spirits and i noticed i wasnt satisfied (at all) after smoking them. But I stuck it out and after a while it was easy to quit. 
Two main reasons: 
1) They taste like dirty asshole. 
2) They only contain nicotine. 
P.s. American spirits contain a freebased form of nicotine that should theoretically be harder to quit - but since its the only ingredient, and not a synergistic cocktail of like a dozen addictive ingredients -its still waaay easier to quit smoking them. "
"Apart from that, take a moment to analyze your habits, e.g. what time you smoke, during what activities, after what events... Knowing when youre gonna have a craving helps you combat it. "
"
Drinking and not smoking is exponentially hardest. idk.  all bets are off or I'm grinding my teeth with a scotch glass in my hand.
Nicotine is evil, it is the devil, it stays with you.  I was in withdrawal 3 months. I curse it damnation.
It's stupid, smoke in the lungs, what more encouragement do you need along with a dozen diseases and cancer.  Study the lungs, look at the devastation.
Run 5 miles in 32 minutes \m/
Never again, take up running."
"Aside from all the need for nicotine 
One small thing that helped a lot, as stupid as it sounds,  having a toothpick in your mouth the whole time "
"I used an e-cigarette. The mental habit was surprisingly easy to quit. I had tried 6 times prior.
The physical habit was a bitch and caused relapse. Eventually, the physical habit just became a single problem to focus on. It was subsequently easier to quit.
What I learned on my way was that it's a two stage process. The physical and mental habit loop. I guess without thinking I tackled them individually and won. Smoke free since 2013."
"If you're into trying drugs to help you quit, Wellbutrin can help."
"Stop buying them. This should be the easiest step for a lot of people.
Now, you probably have smoker friends. Don't excuse yourself with them when they step outside. Don't bum smokes.
People bitch about the addiction and the cravings, that's a load of shit. Get over yourself. If you care, you'll quit. They're cigarettes, not liquor, not meth, not cocaine. The addiction isn't nearly as strong as people fucking pretend it is, they're just really fucking easy to buy and really easy to bum here and there."
"You have to want to quit.  When you find yourself reaching for a cigarette STOP.  Tell yourself "" I will skip this one..the next time I want one I can smoke""  Then wait until the urge hits again and indulge.  I went from a pack a day to 2 a day.  At that point it is semantics.  Don't tell yourself you can't smoke..just make yourself wait.  Again..If you don't really want to quit there is no point trying."
"The biggest obstacle for me was driving, I always wanted a cigarette while driving. I kept things like suckers or tic tacs in my car to munch on until I no longer craved to smoke. 
It's been 3 years and for the most part I'm doing great, but I still very occasionally want a cigarette when I'm stressed, drinking, or sometimes just ramdomly. I remind myself of the time I quit for 5 months, and after giving in from stress I was smoking more than ever! Almost 2 packs a day! I dont want to ever go back to that."
"Okay, my process of quitting was long and came in stages, but I'll share one thing that I used for myself. I try to take care of myself, workout, eat healthy, wear sunscreen so I don't get skin damage. I never noticed smoking affecting how I looked, but knew it could down the line. I mean ABSOLUTELY NO OFFENSE to anyone, but what I did was take note of people I saw in their cars smoking cigarettes. I noticed how, even if they looked young and clean, just the visual of them smoking made me think their whole car and person was kinda grimey. I realized that's probably what I look like. Then I paid special note to the people smoking who are older, and how wrinkley their skin looked and they just looked stale. And how they probably didn't think they came off that way, as I hadn't. I figured I didn't want that to be me and it helped, especially in those times of car-cravings. "
Start vaping.
Make sure whatever you're using to supplement the oral fixation has a limited supply.  That's a major issue when someone is trying to quit.  
"First time I tried to quit, I started vaping. It made it so much worse.
Second time I was going through a divorce and just wanted to feel better about myself. I started again after meeting my second wife who smoked.
After we found out we were pregnant, it took us both about 2 weeks. It’s been 1 1/2 years now. We both occasions have a smoke (once or twice a year) but feel like shit afterwards.
Pro tip: get preggers.
Joking aside, doing it for someone other than myself made it easier for me."
"Don't lie to yourself.  
 
""I'll just have one and be ok""  
No you won't. You'll be back to a pack a day in a week. "
"Not me, but my uncle told me that a heart attack is the most effective anti-smoking message he ever got.  He got up one morning, took his first drag of the day, and felt the worst pain of his life in his chest, shooting into his left arm.  Never touched another one."
"Maybe try a vaporizer, got me and my parents off cigarettes. Made quitting a lot easier for us."
You must REALLY WANT to quit. I found bike racing and since I am not Mario Cippolini I had to quit to have a prayer of competing. 
"Among many of the other tips I'm sure you'll see; I only pay for gas at the pump when I fill up my car. That way I don't go inside the store and see the wall of cigarettes tempting me. Bonus, it also prevents me buying energy drinks and other stuff."
"Quit Caffeine first. 50% of your cravings are from Caffeine but you don't realize it.
Then, just... quit. Power through. I sleep a lot for three days. After that, it's a lot easier.
That's it. Took me 4 tries over several years before I finally REALLY made it stick, but I've been smoke free for 8 years this month and have no desire to go back.
I was a smoker for 30 years prior to finally quitting."
Taking Wellbutrin pills. Worked amazingly well. Had to take them for a full year before my brain started working right. 
"Willy Nelson method... I rolled up 20 joints and put them in my pack and changed my habit. I was at a pack a day; By day 3, I had only managed to get through 12"
"My dad put all the ashes and cigarette butts in a jar for a week or two; he then opened the jar and smelled inside. He was so disgusted with the smell that he felt ashamed that, by smoking next to non-smokers, they had to smell that disgusting smoke. Left it right away and hasn't smoked in more than 25 years."
"First thing is not buying cigarettes. Second thing is avoiding people who smoke. 
Third thing is don't go out for a while. No drinks with buddies. 
Fourth thing is clean up your diet. Mostly vegetables, all home cooked. 
Fifth thing is start a project. Study for a certification or build something with woodwork. 
Sixth thing, exercise daily. 
Seventh and last thing, every time you're dying for a cigarette, take 10 dollars and put it in a piggy bank, preferably one you can't open without destroying it. 
Maintain this lifestyle for 3 days, then another week, then another 3 weeks, then another 2 months, then another 3 months, and give it another 3 months. 
Come back in 9 months and tell us how your life is going. "
"The accomplishment of being an ex-smoker is on you alone. Realizing that it is you that needs to believe in your capabilities is empowering. Focus on those little moments of win.
Also, don't plaster it all over for people to know you're attempting to quit. Including others for moral support is important, but too much and too soon can make one feel like THEIR own accomplishment is no longer ultimately their own responsibility. It is too much pressure and you can get inside of your head.
In five days, I'll be smoke-free for 3 years. (I started at about 12 years old and smoked til I was  26). 
I had what I see now as a ""perfect timing"" situation that is not going to happen for most. I was suffering from a severe cough due to a cold and I also was just tired. Slept all day. Woke up in the evening and had a realization I hadn't smoked (due to sleeping the whole day AND realizing whenever I had a craving, it wasn't worth it to get out of bed) and I decided to focus on that little triumph and see what happened. 
I went the next day with no smoking and in the middle of the third, I told my boyfriend that I hadn't smoked, let alone missed it too much.  Every day since, it got easier and easier and now I have little moments where I have to focus to recall that I used to be a smoker. It's surreal.
From my own experience, I say just focus on the little winning feeling you get  each time you resist a craving and DON'T make it anyone else's business but your own until you feel more confident and understand that YOUR own goal is attainable by just yourself. If I included others for support (as I did in attempts prior) I always felt like I let them down and it became a ""community project,"" while I scapegoated my own failures in a way. 
EDIT: I had 2 mini relapses (both while I was intoxicated) in later months where I bought a pack of smokes. I smoked 2 from the first pack and 1 from the next, each time throwing the pack triumphantly into the trash when I was sober and didn't actually like the taste/experience. Wasted money by not smoking them and tossing them is shitty but it's more shitty waste of money to smoke them, too."
"A lot of answers here tell you to replace with with something else, but honestly I think it's more deep seated than that.  It's a matter of self control which is something that can be worked on. Find ways or methods to improve your self control and you will find smoking and olto fall straight in line with everything else.  You have to want it for it to happen.  "
"1. Make a quit date and stick to it. 
2. Use the Smoke Free app to track your time since last smoke. Looking at that is a good way to boost yourself through some rough points. Its been (x) much time since i last smoked, if i pick up a cig now thats (x) amount of time i spent suffering for nothing,  and I'll just have to do it all again. 
3. Gum, fidget spinners, rubber bands. Keep things around to occupy your hands. 
4. Spoil yourself with the money you save. I bought a new phone after 30 days, cig money payed for it all. Having something to show for what youve been going through is nice. 
5. Stick this motto into your mind, repeat it 5000 times a day if you need to, ""not another puff, no matter what."" Drive that finality home. No. Matter. What. And if you can take it, you can make it. No matter how bad you feel, you will make it through. Just tough through it and you'll be golden. 
Love all you guys, you deserve to make this change and good luck! "
Oh also throw away all smoking paraphernalia. You don't need ash trays or lighters around if your truly committed to quitting. Throw em away now and thank yourself later
"For me I needed a reason, smoking was a small reprieve from my anxiety, and every time I tried to quit I just felt like I couldn't give up that 10 minutes of ""me time"". Then I got a positive pregnancy test and quit cold turkey, handed what was left of my pack to my partner and said ""Well, you're gonna be a daddy, hide these."" And they did.
I'm now 5 months and 2 weeks into my pregnancy and I still occasionally want a cigarette, but I want a healthy child more. It also made me realize I wasn't being the best mom I could be to my other two children and I need healthier coping mechanisms or I could possibly not be around to watch my kids grow up and have families of their own.
So I feel if someone is serious about quitting they should try to find a reason that's important to them."
"The pain and suffering of withdrawal is a great motivator for me. If I go through that for a whole day, and then think about just giving up and having a smoke, I realize that all that pain was for nothing. So I just tough it out a little longer. Then when it's been three days, and I'm nearly ready to chew furniture, that's even more suffering that's all for nothing if I just give up. 
Then it's been a week, and there's even more torture you've been through. Give up now and what a horrible waste!
Then after two or three weeks, the suffering isn't all that bad anymore. Then when all that poison is finally out of your system, you have a real sense of pride and accomplishment (not the EA kind). If you went back to it now, how foolish would you feel?
I realized something else important with all drugs out there. They're all based on poisoning you. You take the drug (in whatever form) and your body kicks in to release the right chemicals to fight the poison. The ""High"" you feel is from your own body's reaction, not from the drug itself. The drug is actually just trying to kill you. This is why the drug's effect diminishes over time and you need more and more. Because your body can no longer produce as much happy chemicals to fight for its life. 
Nicotine is just poison. But it triggers happy chemicals in you that makes you feel like the nicotine caused it. Knowing that, I didn't love nicotine as much anymore. I loved my own body for trying to save me from it."
"Yoga in general helped the most, and taking a walk instead of a smoke break. Replacing the 'ritual' of smoking with something else helps a lot of people. I've also heard success stories of people who quit when they make another change (like new apartment or job etc). "
"If you smoke to cope with stress or some such, figure out a way to cope with something other than cigarettes so that you can still fill that need that cigarettes were giving you."
What worked for me was not buying them ever. I would bum one every now and then for some time after quitting but I made it a rule to never buy them again. Eventually I didn’t enjoy them when I bummed them.
I didnt quit. I stopped buying packs and my latest one ran out 7 months ago. I do not feel like asking people for their money/cigarettes so now I am not a smoker.
Juul baby
"I smoked for twenty years, I had multiple attempts to give it up, last year I was hospitalised with influenza and decided things had to change, I tried going cold turkey but I kept relapsing, so I my partner and I went out looking for decent e cigs * she smokes as well* we found a couple that were decent and under $100, I started with a 18mg liquid mix for a few months and did a half n half system where I would vape inside / gaming etc but outside driving etc id smoke, over the next 10 months I've reduced myself to 3mg nicotine and I have not touched a cigarette in over 3 months now. I'm not saying I'm smoke free but I'm getting there, my partner still smokes like a train but that's her journey to take when she wants, Vape wise I went for 
https://www.vapo.co.nz/products/vapo-alpha-starter-kit
As these are more akin to a cigarette you have to really suck on it, I also found starting with a higher nicotine level helped get me addicted to the vape over cigarettes and you just slowly over months reduce the liquid nicotine levels. "
"i just had my 10 year anniversary!  
over the years i had made a few semi-concerted efforts to quit but ended up giving up on all of them.  i quit when i was pregnant, and by the time baby was a year old i was starting to smoke again.  
i felt really bad about smoking though, guilty, because i was doing something so potentially harmful to my health when i now had a small person counting on me to be around.  i ended up psyching myself out of smoking.  i became so preoccupied with developing breast or lung cancer that it became stressful to smoke -- each time i was thinking this is the one that is starting the cancer.  when my vacation was over and i went back to work i told myself i would quit when i got my first illness of the school year.  in the meantime i would have one on the way to work, and one on the way home and that was it.  two weeks into the school year, i got my first cold, and just stopped.  the one big concession i made was i stopped drinking coffee, because it was a trigger.  i started drinking it again eventually, and i haven't had a cigarette since.  "
A spine
"Don't.
🤘🚬😎👍🆒"
"Be reaistic about what it's gonna be like. The first thing I thought was ""It's gonna take me about two years no less"", and that's exactly what I told my mother. There periods when I smoked about 2 or 3 cigarettes per week and then I would resort back to 10 a day. But I didn't care, having given myself 2 years to adjust it always felt like great progress when I managed to smoke only 3 cigarettes a day. Two years later, and the only time I smoke is when I'm super drunk and there's someone around to treat me a cigarette (I know too well by now that buying a pack is not worth the trouble - I won't want to do anything with it in the morning already). I've been an active smoker for 11 years (I smoked about 10-15 cigarettes a day)."
"Don’t buy some anymore. Don’t ask for. You’ll want to smoke nothing amazing, just don’t."
Just Do It.
48 days free with a vape. I got the cheapest model available and it is working great so far. I have gone from an 18 to a six in that time. Next bottle I get will be at 3
Eat carrot sticks . You don't put on weight by doing this. 
"Take it one minute at a time at first. After awhile those minutes will turn into hours then turns into days until you have learned to live without it.
Know your triggers and be prepared to double down to tough it out when they happen.
Don't give up even if you slip, it will happen.
And after 5 years of being smoke free don't think you can sit at the bar having a few brews with friends and think you can have one because you beat it. Because if you do you'll be buying a pack before you go home.
Like the wife says: ""the cigarette was the end of the meal"", so control your eating, that can be as hard as quitting.
I've also worked with someone that used Chantix and they quit like it was nothing and didn't gain weight.
Good Luck"
"20 year smoker here.  I used the patches.  There was one morning a week after quitting when I got up, got ready for work and started my commute into town.  About half way to work I realized  I hadn't thought about smoke since I woke up. This is when I knew I could do it.  The first week was the foundational layer and I ended up just adding days onto it ever since.  That was 10 years ago.  
I'm not saying it was a walk in the park, but time goes by and eventually I realized it had been a week since I stopped.  Then It was two, then three and so on.  I thought about it less and less and one day I realized I was going to bed and hadn't thought about smoking all day, then all week, all month and so on.  
Good luck.  You can do it.  "
"Little known fact: cigarettes are known to be more difficult to quit than Heroin (not speaking from experience on the heroin part)
YOU CANNOT QUIT BECAUSE OF SOMEONE ELSE.
I've been smoking for 17 years ( started when i was around 13 or so) and i quit a few months back. The thing you have to do is just simple resist the urge to smoke when you are seriously craving one. Allow a few minutes to pass when you have the crazy itch to light one up. It sounds so damn silly but it truly helps the cravings pass. The important thing to do is remind yourself why you quit. Keep that goal in mind.
&#x200B;
My cousin is a Marathon runner and he's told me on a few occasions that when he's in the middle of the race he's literally yelling at him self because of the pain in his legs and the strain it puts on his body and (amidst the run) he tells himself ""that's it as soon as this is over, I'm never signing up for another one again."" As soon as he finishes his race, he can't wait to run his next marathon because of how good it felt to over come his strong urge to simply give up. 
&#x200B;
I use that as an example because of his true inner strength and desire to make himself better. Even when you want to throw in the towel and just say fuck it, just remember why you started it in the first place: to enhance the quality of your life and to achieve something you, by your own volition, decided this is the best choice of your life "
Dont drink for the first 3 months.
"Let people know that you are quitting, specially your smoker friends, as having someone around you smoking can make it very difficult for you to resist. Also, put yourself in situations where you can't smoke, like going to non-smoking bars, or setting a rule for yourself that you can't smoke anywhere inside your house. These did the trick for me. "
"Not me, but my dad has been smoking for 20+ years and finally decided to quit for good when it finally hit him that his health is really deteriorating. He had a bad panic attack once and from then on he started going to the doctor, where he got recommended for Chantix. It wasn't a smooth transition as he did have a lot of urges and mood swings. He tried lollipops and patches along the way but Chantix proved the most effective. It's also a mental game, so when I see him really down I try to take him outside for a walk or join him binge watch something (I got him pretty hooked up on GoT). 
For the past few months, he's been going to different doctors for physical check-ups and fortunately there wasn't anything major for us to worry about. Now he's very focused on staying healthy, going smoke-free for a year now. "
"Slow the drinking down, switch to filterless. "
When you want to quit you do. It is not a secret.
"Don't plan it. Don't reason yourself to it. Just stop. Keep your last pack on you, as a constant reminder.
If you slip up, don't despair.
After a few months, cigarette smoke will nauseate you. It gets easier.
"
"Chantix isn't for everybody, but it was like a miracle cure for me.  Within the first two weeks of taking it, I went from a *minimum* pack-a-day habit to having no urge to smoke whatsoever. I smoked for over a decade till then, but I've never had a single craving since."
But... I like it.
"Quitting smoking is like any other difficult choice that improves your life; it is never a single decision. You are going to face the choice, ""Do I smoke or not smoke?"" And you are going to have to make that hard choice repeatedly, all day every day, for the foreseeable future. 
If you fail to quit smoking, it will be because a time came where you asked yourself, ""Should I choose to be strong and not smoke, or should I just give up and smoke?"" and you will have made the easy choice.  The easy choice only leads to failure. You have to make the hard choice, over and over again, until your body and routine adjust and you finally stop forcing yourself to make the decision. 
Take a person who has never smoked a cigarette in their life. How much time do you think they spend thinking about cigarettes and deciding if they should smoke? Probably about zero. That thought, that decision, it isn't something they're faced with regularly, and that is where you are trying to get to. You want to let your physical urges pass, and you want your daily routine to not feel like there are gaps where your cigarette breaks used to be. 
For the first couple weeks, you have to realize, there are going to be cravings and urges. You are going to want to smoke. You will say to yourself, ""Of course I can't just quit, it's the hardest thing in the world, everyone knows that, so it just makes sense if I give up and fail because it's what you do."" That's bullshit, just a rationalization you'll try to feed yourself in order to make that easy decision seem more appealing and the hard choice unreasonable. Feeling an urge, feeling the desire to smoke and saying to yourself, ""No, I am not a slave to my impulses, I want to be a non-smoker more than I want to be a weakling who gives up the first time they have to make a hard choice, so I am going to choose to not smoke even though part of me wants it,"" THAT is quitting. That's what it comes down to. Making yourself make the hard choice over and over again. 
I think grasping that makes it easier. You want to smoke, you say to yourself, ""I knew I was going to feel this, I knew I was going to want to give in, I knew I was going to have to make this hard choice repeatedly, and now I'm making it.  This is how I quit, one choice at a time.""
After enough time passes, you find yourself having to make the hard choice less and less. You want to give up on your progress less and less as your smoke-free streak grows.  Your lungs start to feel better. You start realizing how much your sense of smell and taste are coming back, surprised because you never realized how much smoking killed those senses. Eventually, you catch a whiff of someone's cigarette smoke, and it instantly gives you a headache and turns your stomach a little bit. You think of having a smoke and feel nothing but mild disgust, and you realize that you've finally become a non-smoker. It's over. You have reached your goal, with nothing but positives to show for it.  
Steel yourself. Prepare to make the hard choice. Don't tell yourself it's ok to give up. Don't make excuses for yourself. Be a non-smoker. You deserve it. "
"I've been quit for about a year and a half. I don't crave anymore, but I still think, ""Oh, I could duck into that shop and buy just one stick if I wanted"". Its just a passing thought and its good not having to struggle with those thoughts any more, but I still wish they wouldn't come up.
In terms of the actual quitting, I had tried patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, e-cigs, and various prescription medications. Some would have me only cutting down, while others might help me to quit for weeks or months at a time. What I did differently this time was fasting, no nicotine replacement therapies at all. Try fasting from sun rise to sunset, no food, no water...no cigarettes...nothing. For me, this approach cut one of the behavioural links in the chain, the association between food/drink and smoking. And at night, when you can eat and drink, I found that I was too exhausted to want to go out and buy a packet, so I just went to bed. It was actually easier quitting this way that it was with nicotine replacement therapy. But I know it doesn't work with everyone. I've seen Muslims fasting too and a lot of them rush straight to the cigarettes before food and drink as soon as their fasting day is over."
"As others have said, you need to want to. For me, it was a way to save $5000/year. And not get cancer.
I vaped for a long time, but wouldn't recommend it. Made it harder for me since it's always right there and you don't have to go outside to use it. It also made me feel like a massive douche in public.  
Nicorette really helped. Eventually you just have to go a few shitty days where you want to yell for little to no reason and eventually stop. You'll always have cravings. It's never over but does get better as time goes on. "
"Cold Turkey. The only way I could do it (twice). There were a few motivating factors.  First time I was lucky, I was pregnant. The second time I quit, I just stopped. Every day  I didn't smoke, I would write $7.00 (the price of of a pack) on the calendar. This would remind me how much money I was saving"
Smoke them all at once and plug your nose. Can’t smoke when you’re dead!
"When I was quiting, every time things got tough I'd remind myself that there was a time before I started smoking. That remunder helped me keep things in perspective."
"Build on each day. Every day look at how far you've come and build on that. think .. ""Man.. if i have one now i will throw away all the suffering up to this point..."". This helped me through. eventually i didn't want to smoke any longer. "
"What was the turning point for me was just accepting that it was going to be hard and that I would likely feel shit for a period of time. I tend to avoid a lot of things due to anxiety/used cigarettes as an avoidance strategy, so just normalising that helped me to hang in while the worst times passed. It's been a year now but I still have to remind myself during stressful periods."
"CHANTIX
I chain smoked for 40 years.
Got up at night to smoke.
Took Chantix, had no desire, just stopped. Wasn't even hard to do.
It REALLY worked for me."
Start during a vacation if possible.
"Just stop. If you start again, repeat as necessary."
Zyban. It’s magic.
"vape. i quit using those cheapo blu cig-a-likes without even trying. I liked not having to get out of bed to smoke(vape), i think that's what sold me.
now I've got a bigger mod but honestly I feel like I could quit that without much effort, I'm down to 3mg juice.
either way I've saved a ton of money, and I don't hack up a bunch of phlegm every morning anymore. I can't stand the taste or smell of cigs anymore. I used to smoke around 60/day ryo's."
"Collapse a lung, worked for me."
"1. Cut out alcohol completely, and as much caffeine as you can.
2. Keep busy - put off doing all of your chores until you start quitting. You will need to stay as distracted as possible for the first 5 days.
3. When cravings are horrible, count to 100. Nicotine cravings come in waves - they appear quickly and they can disappear quickly as well.
4. Know that you WILL be depressed, possibly very severely. You need to know going in that you cannot trust your emotions during the first week. You will feel awful, you will feel VERY depressed, and it will pass. 
5. Before beginning write down a list of reason you truly want to quit. Keep it with you.
6. The worst of it comes between days 3 thru 5. After day 5 it becomes much easier. By day 14 almost all cravings and symptoms are gone.
7. Care for your quit. Don't get cocky and have a smoke with a drink, don't start vaping, and keep reminding yourself why you quit in the first place. Quitting is very doable; unfortunately, getting hooked again is very easy.
Don't worry about failure, don't beat yourself up if you stumble and fall. Most people take hundreds of tries before doing it, but you can do it."
"What worked for me-- I didn't say alright that's it no more cigs for the rest of my life. In the last two years I have probably smoked three packs. I'm not ever going to quit completely, I will always have a few every once in a while when I'm getting hammered with a bunch of people. But I don't crave them anymore and I used to smoke half a pack a day."
"The night before you plan on quitting, go out, get fucking smashed and smoke loads of cigs. You’ll be so hungover it’ll make at least the first 24 hours easier to go without one because it’ll make you wanna puke. "
I watched my uncle slowly die of lung cancer caused by years of smoking. Not something I would recommend but it got me to quit.
"This may not work for everyone. I quit on my birthday. I had a solid date, and I stuck to it. Cold turkey, never looked back. Just have a date and fucking just do it. This is a bad answer but that's what I did and it worked. "
"Smoke only tips.    
You'll stop soon."
"Vaping. But don't tell the FDA, they'll call bullshit."
"Chantix. Worked like a charm. I smoked for 12 years and was up to two packs a day at my worst.
Also its fucking terrifying and you need people that can support you. "
I fell in love and felt guilty about hiding it the first few months. Quit for a year before telling her. We're now engaged and have been together 4 and a half years! 
Don’t tell anyone. 
"Cannabis. Specifically, out of a ""one-hitter"". "
"My grandma told me ""If you want something, you'd have it by now""
Went cold turkey immediately after that, from nearly a decade of a pack or more a day"
"Buy a decent vape & start with high nicotine juice. Every couple weeks, kick the nicotine level down until you're on 0 for a couple weeks. During this, up your water intake by A LOT. By the time you hit 0 you should have cleared out your sinuses, have your taste and smell back and cigs will seem disgusting to you. At that point you simply put down the vape and concentrate on staying productive. Not being productive, getting stressed out and drinking are what cause a relapse in this. I dunno if that will work for you, but that's how I kicked it and I haven't been smoking for nearly a year. It's so nasty to me now that I had to get rid of some friends who were enablers."
"Just accept the fact that you want to transform into an uptight weirdo for the rest of your life, and then have fun being that. I am an ex-smoker *and* an ex-drinker, and nobody likes me very much anymore but goddammit, I can breathe and exercise and no more hangovers and I have money now!!
Creeeeepy...."
"Well, I will tell you what did it for me. I threw my cigarettes out the window as I followed behind the ambulance that was taking my father to the hospital because he was having a heart attack brought on by smoking 2 packs a day for 40 years. This was followed by watching him as he was bed ridden for two years with emphysema. I do not exaggerate when I say that he sufferers through and struggled for every breath he took during those two years."
"Take champix (Aka chantix in the USA, I think).
It's a pharmaceutical pill that literally stops you smoking,  has a 99.99% success rate, and bears next to no side effects.
Obviously talk to your doctor first, but  this pill being in existence renders all other quitting methods moot: forget gum, patches, vaping (doesn't work anyway, lol), hypnotherapy, self help books, etc. Who needs them when you can just take a pill for a few months and stop smoking forever?
I smoked for over 10 years, between 10 and 20 a day, and I stopped forever within 2 weeks of taking champix. That was 6 years ago and I haven't smoked since. 
Honestly, this pill works so bloody well that there's no excuse for anyone to keep smoking. It's unbelievable to me that it isn't the first thing mentioned on threads like this. "
"Chantix worked for me and I’m going over ten years now. I really wanted to quit. Watching my grandmother’s failing health was my trigger.  Chantix’s side effects suck, and the first two weeks sucks because of the withdrawal.  If you’re going to take Chantix, know what your getting into because the side effects can be discouraging for some.  "
Don’t throw away the smokes. Put them on a shelf so you have to see them every day. Quitting takes will power. If you’re not willing to quit you won’t quit. The feeling of being in control helps. 
"Number 1 - don't quit because people tell you or because ""you should cuz it's bad for you"". You quit, because you want to. For me, morning caughing started to get scary, so I quit cold turkey.
Number 2 - don't ""quit forever"". How about just for a day? If you make it, what's stopping you from doing it 1 more day? Suddenly, it's been a week, you have a streak going, why stop? Aim for another week! Until you realise it - you've been ""streaking"" for a month, you're a fucking boss now!
Number 3- find a substitute- go running, swimming, download Pokemon Go, whatever will keep you busy and engaged.
Number 4 - F the haters and avoid going with pals for ""their"" smoke break. Smoking is usually a social activity, I know, its going to be weird at first and your friends are going to tempt you ""come on, who are you kidding, you've never stopped"". You're gonna think - they're smoking now, I'm so jealous, but, in reality They are going to be the jealous ones, because you're actually trying to better your life, you're stronger, and they are jealous and will want you to join them, so that you can be weak once more, just like them. If you manage to rise above though, you will inspire people to follow your lead, that much I promise you. "
Looked at my wallet realized I would be a lot more well off if I just quit. Healthier as well. I just stopped cold turkey after I did that simple math. There are 0 pros to smoking and too many cons.
"I started using an ecigarette whenever I had the craving, which broke the association between nicotine, smoke and social situations. Before that it had gotten to the point where I'd go to the pub for a few drinks just because then I know I could have a smoke without beating myself up. 
You can get ecigarette liquid of various nicotine percentage so it's easier to then wean yourself off (a process I'm on the way to). Obviously ecigarettes are worse than quitting 100% but this is the only approach I've had that has worked for me so far. Feels good to not have a cold for once "
"In February it's 2 years without smoking.
I got a little cold and decided to not smoke that day. I was always smoking, even if I was sick. I got through the day and thought why not try another one and so on. So I didn't put myself under pressure with the tought of never smoking again. 
I know a lot of people see it different, but it helped me to keep my cigarettes, lighters etc and not throw everything away. If I 'needed' to smoke, I could, but I kept trying not to.
I heard a bunch of people, who quit or tried to, say that they can't have a coffee or a beer as they always combined it with the cigarette. After tried to have a few beers, doing things where I was smoking as soon as possible. This way I got rid of the thought that I need a cigarette while having a beer. 
It's a fight in the beginning, but you get along better day for day. I had a very few days after like the first 3 months and 6 months, where I really wanted to smoke but stay resistant is getting easier.
After 2 months I started with running, doing some sports is helping as well.
I admit I took like maybe 10 shots since I stopped and I don't know why. But I guess that's ok compared to how much I'd have taken if I went on smoking as I did."
"You're going to attempt to get rid of a habit. Figure out a new healthy habits to fill that void with. 
For instance, you used to smoke after a heavy meal? Instead, drink a water every time. No matter what, drink a water after every heavy meal until it becomes a habit. Trick yourself into loving it."
"I read ""The easy to stop smoking"" by Allen Carr. I quit for 10 years now."
Champix. 
"Stop now, stop right away, just give it up. Any amount of planning or ""weaning"" off is going to fail, it's all will power. Also start working out if you don't so your body has an excuse to kick it too. "
"For me it was the patch, breathing exercises, and the Quit Tracker app. It keeps track of time passed, money saved, and life regained. "
"Firstly, you have to really want to quit.  I had tried and failed multiple times before I seriously decided to quit. I decided to quit because smoking was seriously impacting my health. I was falling sick 3 times a month so I decided to quit cold turkey. 
Secondly, you need a strong support system. I had a group of friends who would kept encouraging me and helped me be distracted during my withdrawal. I remember begging my cousin for one drag. She kindly but firmly refused (I’m forever grateful).
Thirdly, you have to accept that it is a process. It’s hard in the beginning but it gets easier over time. I avoided drinking in the first few weeks because I knew it would make me want to smoke. I would also leave an area where there would be smokers around. Gradually it got easier and now I can be around smokers without the urge to smoke.
Fourthly, if you fail, don’t be too harsh on yourself. It’s a difficult to beat an addiction. If you do give in, don’t give up on the process of quitting. Just start over again. What helped me was to keep a count of days I had gone without smoking. Everytime I felt the urge to smoke, I would look at the count and would ask myself if it was worth giving up on the progress I had made.
Lastly, keep yourself distracted. Try working out, reading a book, chewing some gum, watching a movie or just taking a walk when the craving hits.
Remember that it’s not impossible. Just keep at it and eventually it will get better and you won’t feel the dependency of nicotine. "
"For me it was the habits surrounding smoking... Rolling down the window in the car, drinking on patios, etc.
Avoid some of that for a while and it helps."
"Pneumonia - after a week and a half of that I’ve been off for the past 2. years.
Cant tell you where to get it though - it’s seasonal, apparently. "
"I am not kidding you. Getting sick with the flu made me quit. I was confined to my bed for 5 days because of the flu, which once I got over I got a lung infection. #blessed
I've lasted now 14 full days without a smig and I feel great. I even gave my half pack to my buddy because I dont even want one. Maybe its becuase I'm so focused on getting better but, even so. I've already gone 2 weeks without one. Why not quit now right? #weirdbutitworks 
"
"I still take “smoke breaks.” I used to stop and crochet between studying at the times I wanted a cigarette. I don’t need to crochet anymore, but I still do go outside sometimes when I would have smoked. You don’t need a cigarette when you are stressed, you need a break, so take one!"
I used a vape! Vaped for about a year and then quit. Going on 4 years without a cig and 3 without a vape. Don’t crave them or anything. I know there’s not much research about vapes but if it can help me quit overall I think they’re pretty awesome. 
"For me, delaying cigarette breaks. Pur off every cigarette for an extra half hour or something. Eventually, you will half your habit without ever feeling like you are denying yourself something."
"I have been smoke free for 10 years. It took several attempts. The last attempt worked.  First I had contemplated seeing a hypnotist, she explained that she would take me back to the first time I had a cigarette. See the body naturally tells you that this is bad for you, by coughing etc.  But your brain tells your body a different story. For me, smoking was to fit in.  So when I started, I felt good, I was relaxed. I was cool.  So my brain over road my body telling me that this was bad, and said it was good for me.  The hypnotist would reprogram that thought process and my brain would agree with my body and say “this shit ain’t cool!”  
So after visualizing that process it helped to quit.  I never did use the hypnotist. Unless she did it without me even knowing it. Lol. I also did a lot of research, read a lot of books, and the best way for me was to use nicotine gum and lozenges.  I planned a quit date, and worked back from there.  I gradually decreased the level of nicotine till I didn’t need it any more.  I substituted regular gum and hard candy after stopping the nicotine products. 
I also asked myself why I smoked now.  For me it was nerves. I used cigarettes to cope with stress.  So I found a new way to cope. Once I identified my sources of stress, I learned to deal with them differently. It helped that I was also in AA.  So having worked the steps, I applied the steps to cigarettes instead of alcohol. 
So don’t get down if it doesn’t work the first time. Keep trying!!  And it also helps to have a motivating factor.  For me it was my son.  It was cold outside and he was pretending to “smoke” by blowing hot air in the cold. He said “ mommy look, I’m smoking like you”. That fucking broke my heart!  
It also helps to reward yourself with the money saved from not buying cigarettes.  And get something nice. Have a preplanned reward to work towards. When I quit they were still $5 a pack. Lol. But it adds up.  You can start by not smoking in your usual places.  I didn’t smoke inside at the time, so I mostly smoked in my car.  I stopped smoking there first.  Also push yourself to wait longer, and longer, for the next smoke.  Move a muscle, change a thought.  Busy yourself to forget the craving.  And once the physical need passes it’s easier to get over the emotional need.  
Good luck!!"
"Be aware that your fuse for getting pissed off is going to be a lot shorter but remind yourself why and work through it. Also patches, use nicotine patches."
Welbutrin made cigarettes fucking gross to me. I started taking it for depression not realizing that it was commonly prescribed for smoking cessation and gradually they just started being unbearable. Please take little side-effect. 
"Smoked for 25 years. Tried the gum, the patch and Chantix but none of them stuck. Bought myself an ecig 3 years ago, got into it as a bit of a hobby while slowly reducing my nicotine level and finally, about a year and a half ago, gave it up for good. Vapes get a lot flack but I swear by them as a way to stop smoking."
"My last cigarette was July 9th. I decided to quit when there was only one stick left on the pack. I was too lazy to get more. I thought hey maybe I should try, see how I last. Didn't think I'd actually end up quitting. I chewed on nicorette gum for a week. Pretty much chewed it all day, as much as I wanted really. First week was pretty rough. My gf kept me motivated alot. I learned to hate the sticks. For me that was key. As much as I wanted to smoke, I reminded myself why I wanted to quit in the first place. I tried once last year. Lasted a week. This time I was more prepared on what to expect. For me I realised after a meal I'd like to have a smoke. In the morning with my coffee or even when I pooped lol. Anyways pal hope you can quit as well. Even if you break remember to always try again. Good luck."
"I stopped with a group of friends and we had a ""slap bet"" that if we caught anyone smoking, every one of us get to slap that person 3 times within the span of a month, it can be at any time. I quit cold turkey and never looked back. First few days sort of sucked but after that I never thought about cigs again."
Don't smoke at home. Then it gets easier to ween yourself off.
"So.. true story. I literally quit smoking because one day I was so insanely lazy I didn't want to bother going outside to smoke. This continued until gradually, I just stopped. My tip is be really really really lazy."
"Not a smoker , but helped my dad quit at the age of 61. He had been smoking since he was 11. I bought him a vape box mod. I know a lot of people say it makes you vape more than you’d smoke because of ease of use, can use it indoors etc... But the real key was for him to wait until he really couldn’t take the craving anymore then only take one rip of the vape. 6 mg juice , wouldn’t feel like a full cig but would be just enough to kill the craving. The idea is that he was taking in less nicotine with one small vape puff compared to a full cig so over time his cravings became less and less . 6 mg juice turned to 3 mg juice which turned to 0 mg juice which turned to no more using the vape. He was a smoker of 50 years and fully quit nicotine in about 4 months. He wanted to quit which helps obviously but the vapes are really useful if you use as intended. I’m proud of him. "
"You think you smoke because you choose to. You think you’re in control when in fact it’s the altered chemical composition in your brain that makes you think that.
Once I realized that I never trusted the desire to smoke again. It was no longer my desire, it was alien to my brain. I couldn’t possibly accept that. "
"It's a lot like having a bad head cold. It's a constant 24/7 nagging misery, but it gets better with every passing day. Just remember that if you had done this a year ago, you'd be a non smoker and you really wouldn't miss it at all.
Most importantly, don't cheat. Ever. If your brain knows it can trick you into a smoke once, it will keep trying until you give in. "
I smoked for 7 years. I got a new girlfriend (my now wife) and she made me want to quit. I think a lot was I was just ready. If you think you are ready you can do it. I quit cold turkey. Yes it was hard but I got over it and so can you. Mind over matter 
Go cold turkey.  You will likely relapse but each successive attempt gets easier
"So the thing that helped me was recognizing that it's kind of a reward system. Like, ""I ate breakfast, so I get a cigarette""  Once I started identifying the times I was rewarding myself it made it easier to be aware of my tendencies before they happened. 
I also started creating rules,  and if you're tying too quit now it's a good time. I started in early winter
1)  no smoking during daylight. Once you get on with that...
2)  no smoking during daylight,  or on days off. Now you get a day or two of no smoking at all
3)  no daylight,  days off, and not before work. Now you have to learn to start the day without the habit
4) only after work, when being social. Now you can enjoy it casually... if you want. 
It takes patience,  but you can do this. "
"I know that I am late to the party, I used cold turkey and vaping, then accidentally quit vaping."
Try vaping . It worked for me
smoke pot instead.
I had a specific date set to quit (Nov 1st 2009.) Throughout the summer I started tapering down. My intention was to get used to the cravings. By Halloween night that year I was down to one cig per day and I never smoked since (although the cravings never completely went away.)
"Oh yeah, my grandma smoked for a long time then got pneumonia and couldn’t stand the thought of it ever again so there’s that."
Dont fall into temptation. If u have quit for a few days/weeks and u really want one. Just remember how good u feel when u wake up
"Baby Steps, imo
I find exercise helped me a lot. 
I started by going for a walk when I went out for a smoke. Everytime I decided to go outside for a smoke I would walk and smoke. 
Then one day when I felt up for it I just walked. Didn't smoke. Over time I walked more than I smoked and eventually I stopped smoking.
You can then think about going for a run instead of walking if you really want to get in shape."
"I recently quit but to be honest I didn't smoke as much as most smokers because I'd cut down over the years.  But here is what I did to just stop completely. Well, now I vape.  
So I started vaping with a vape pen but didn't like the throat burn that the pg oil gives.  So I started trying the 80% vg which doesn't burn and gives a lot more smoke.  I like more volume.  They say the pen can't do the vg oil but it does fine.  
After doing that a while I met somebody who mixes his own vape oil and liked the stuff he was making so I decided to try making my own.  After a couple of batches I found the mix I like but I stopped putting nicotine in it.  I was vaping nicotine free for about a month when I took a month long trip overseas.  It was great! I found myself perfectly fine without vaping during flights although I still enjoyed it when it was comfortable.  
Now I still vape but I can go hours or even a day or so without doing it because I don't have any nicotine cravings.  But I still vape because I enjoy it and it doesn't stink or give me any physical problems.
People that want to ban vaping can go to hell because it is really helpful in cutting back or quitting smoking."
"Shatter your leg, spend 11 days in the hospital, have the doctor tell you that smoking will give your leg a 50/50 chance of healing properly."
"Spend time around people you like who don't smoke. As you hang out with them more the social pressure decreases. Last cigarette was over 4 years ago, on my first date with my bf. He doesn't smoke and I never feel the need around him."
Stop smoking! 
"One year when the Toronto Raptors got eliminated, I smoked a pack and a half in one night and was sick for a full day. Haven't smoked since. Do that?"
Remove yourself from all the situations you usually smoke in. I went on a weeks fitness holiday where I couldn't smoke. Been off them now for 13 months :)
"I got sick. Just a really bad flu where I was hardly eating or getting out of bed for like 5 days.
When I finally got better and went back to work, I thought ""I have this whole pack of cigarettes, I can't let it go to waste. I'll use this to slowly ween myself off and then quit."" So I went out to have one. It was gross. So I put it out and threw away the whole pack, and made a big proclamation to everyone I know, to hold me accountable."
"I finally quit after moving to altitude (way more out of breath than usual), might not be the most practical solution but it worked for me!"
"I would write on the inner side of the top of the packet ""why?""
It's amazing how infrequently you can actually come up with a legit reason to have a cigarette.  Almost everytime,  I'd just close the pack without smoking.  After a short while, I didn't need to open the pack, I'd just have no good reason  to want to smoke, so I stopped."
If you lapse back into smoking you can quit again. I was a serial quitter till one time I quit and never went back.
"Just don’t lol. I just quit smoking. It was hard to fall asleep, I was cranky, sure I wanted one......the trick is don’t. Smoking is a weakness and it’s a habit and all habits are hard to break. But you do it. Otherwise you’ll probably die lol. I wanted one when I got up......Got in the car......got to work.....came home, when I was bored, when I was with friends......my trick to quitting was not having a cigarette when I wanted one. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Edit: don’t vape or use gum or patches or what have you.....it’s just replacing cigarettes. I promise. You will not die if you don’t have a cigarette. No one ever died from not smoking. Just don’t. "
"Run everywhere. Every time you have to leave the house - jog.  
  
You don't have to run like crazy or like run for exercise every day, but if you have to go to the corner store or something, just jog - it'll prevent you from smoking, get you used to being outside without a cigarette in your hand and the little adrenaline spite will curb the cigarette cravings.....also you'll get places faster."
"Gum instead of the after meal cigarette. Keep in mind that you are CHOOSING to quit, not that you HAVE to quit, being aware that I could choose to go to the store and get smokes if I wanted and I was choosing not to made it a lot easier, I stopped feeling like I was depriving myself. The book Keep Quit by Terry Rustin was a small but mighty help, I don’t think it’s in print anymore but you can probably find it secondhand somewhere (Amazon has it). Lastly, never stop trying. I lost count of how many attempts I made until it finally stuck, now it’s been 13 years smoke free. Good luck!"
"Find something that works for you. I've tried nicotine gum, patches, gum, lollipops, cold turkey, seeds, etc. I know people where medication worked and others where it had no effect. Any person's solution may or may not work for you.
What worked for me was a vape. I started with a pen style and tried to just not reach for a cigarette when I wanted one. It took a few weeks to get used to it and soon I would have a cigarette on my way too work then sometime around dinner - stopped smoking at work.
A couple months and I got down to 2 or 3 a day (from half a pack or so per day for about 25 years). A couple mote months and it was 1, sometimes 2 a day. I just stopped paying attention to it and used the vape to get me through. I switched up to a bigger vape somewhere around the 6 month mark, but around the 8 or 9 month mark I was sitting at my computer one night when it suddenly occurred to me that I hadn't had a cigarette in 3 or 4 days. I really wanted one right then of course and stepped outside to smoke it, but as time went on I wanted one more and more infrequently. Now I haven't had a cigarette in about 7 months or so. I still use the vape and have started cutting back on the nicotine content in my juices."
It’s kind of cheating but vaping got me off cigarettes with no withdrawals. I definitely consume more nicotine in general though.
"before you quit, during those last few days of smoking, don't do anything else while you smoke. don't check your phone, just concentrate on the smoking and you may notice you don't much like it"
"I was smoking multiple packs a week. The damage it did to my body and wallet were becoming more apparent after every binge smoking session. I'm a pretty stressed out person so it was one of the main ways I distracted myself. The $400+ that went to just smomkjg every month and constantly wheezing was a wake up call.
I quit cold Turkey because I knew trying to go slow wouldn't work (I've tried it before). I lessened my oral fixation by replacing cigarettes with gum and lollipops. I also have unfortunately lost my appetite because smoking after a meal was really relaxing for me so I cant really eat a whole meal anymore as it will remind me of smoking. I have also distanced myself from my heavy smoker friends because social expectations are actually quite heavy on the individual and I knew that ""hey just smoke one"" would lead me to smoking a whole pack at a party."
"Just fucking do it. Like stop right now, even if you have half a pack left. It's not worth it. I just quit one day. "
"My advice is to wait for a change in routine. I waited until i got a new job, and used the change in my life to break the cycle! Smoke free for 6 months!"
"Ugh, go out for a bar night. Drink WAYYYYY to much. Smoke 3 packs of cigarettes. 
Wake up, think about your actions and smoke a cigarette. Go vomit and commit to never doing either again. 
Done! 
Supplement cravings with weed!"
"You need to recognize you signs of addiction (fairly easily) but the key for me was learning what type of addiction it is (physical, mental, emotional etc). Now The coping strategy is replacing the addiction with something else. But it has to match. You have a physical addiction? You won’t cut it out by reading a book. You need to take a hot bath or go for a run. Mental addiction? You need to occupy your mind. Learn something or get a hobby, solve some puzzles. This sounds daft at first but in practice it can work. At the age of 24 I had problems with smoking, alcohol drugs gambling and sex. I’ve been 2 years sober from drugs, 1 year sober from alcohol. About 3 months with no smoking and haven’t gambled in 2 years. I’m working on the whole porn/sex thing but hey Rome wasn’t built in a day, right? "
Vape and slowly lower the nicotine over time and replace with cbd then eventually lean off of using it all together
I smoked 2 packs a day for about 5 years and the only way I could fully quit cigarettes was by moving to a device like the juul or ON! Pouch which i was then able to lean off nicotine altogether. 
"I smoked for 8 years, half a pack a day (sometimes more). For me, I got really sick; high fever, bed ridden, cough, etc. I was sick for 2 straight weeks even with meds. I’m sure my frequent smoking contributed to how quickly I could get over an illness. Usually I’m so sick that I don’t even want to smoke so I “quit” for the 2 straight weeks and because of that, i thought to myself, “hmm it’s almost Christmas and I need to save money and I’m already over the week long hump of quitting... well I might as well ride this out.”  It’s been almost a year and I’m finally at the point of feeling grossed out by the smell and the thought of it.  Soooo my advice is to get sick? Idk this isn’t too helpful.... but! Just a tip, don’t believe the motivational speeches saying that you’ll never crave a cigarette after quitting for x amount of time. Everyone’s different. For example, my coworker has quit for 20 years and still craves a cigarette every now and then. I would have dreams of smoking cigarettes again. Be kind to yourself, be forgiving, but be strong <3 
Edit: one last tip! Don’t tell anyone you quit! For the few weeks, I wasn’t sure if I’d stick by it. I also didn’t want the pressure of people congratulating me and then I’d fall off the wagon again and feel ashamed. So I kept it a secret, I only told my SO and a trusted friend. They both helped me stay off the smoking which helped a lot. I could call them at weird hours and tell them to lecture me as to why I shouldn’t pick up a new pack. After about 2 or 3 solid months I was finally confident enough to tell people I officially quit.   "
"At work: Try to avoid thinking about smoking. So don't tell anybody that you quit because they'll constantly ask you how that's going. Try slowing down the world around you as best you can.  
At home: I tried a more in-my-face approach. I left filthy, smelly ashtrays around my house. I've kept an unopened carton of cigarettes (7 yrs. so far) and put all my lighters in a bowl of water. I tell people that I *quit lighting* cigarettes - *quitting smoking* was just a side effect.  
Try to keep your mind occupied (I did puzzles). Try to keep a positive outlook. And take it one day at a time. It gets so much easier after the first four months."
Six years for me. I do use the nicotine lozenges though. They are 4mg of nicotine compared to 14 to 16 mg for a single cigarette. 
"The two top things that helped me the most were:  
Really having a desire to quit. You have to want it.  
When the urge to grab a smoke hits, go brush your teeth."
Stop looking for that one main reason to quit. I spent years waiting for a symbolic boot up my arse to push me to quit and then one day I realised I just didn't have any reason to smoke and a million to quit so signed up for patches and never looked back.  Lots of people say that they'll quit when they turn x years old or if they start dating a nonsmoker etc but they're really just procrastinating.
"Don't fret if you mess up. I dropped heroin and booze easier than nicotine. Meth... not so much, but use it less than I smoke. I can get through weeks without meth, but until recently I couldn't get through a day without a smoke. If you mess up, it's not because you're weak. It's because nicotine is addictive as shit. "
"Went cold turkey 3 years ago. Nothing else ever did it for me. Every time I tried to use nicotine gum or patch or anything like that I’d just end up using a patch and smoking on top of it. Exercise defiantly helps ( I ran a lot), but just stay busy and do anything you can to take your mind off of it.I always had the mindset Every urge i resist  is a battle won. It takes about 2 or 3 weeks to get thru the rough part but you will want one, just out of the blue, for a Long time. I hadn’t touched one for two years and just got a urge a couple weeks ago. I had 2 and threw the rest away, It tasted too good it was scary. I agree with everyone else. Slipping up once isn’t the end of the world,just be fully aware of what happens if one or two becomes, ill just smoke for a couple days. Cigarretes are so addictive it’s crazy."
Stop. It sucks but the only way. One trick i found that helped and worked to this day is repeated remind myself of the gross aspects which creates a revulsion. Even on golf trips with buddies who are social smokers my brain triggers the revolution and I don’t crave it at all. This gross approach is way more effective for me than the health factors because they’re long term where as the gag reflex of “ash tray smell” is easy to conjure up as a trigger to stop me.  Good luck!
"Not me, but I know a guy who said ‘anytime you smoke a cigarette, focus on the taste’"
Just stop buying cigarettes. Thats it. Lmao last time I smoked was 2 years ago 
"This is probably way too late & will get buried, but I took Chantix and my then GF (now wife) texted me naughty pictures to distract me whenever I had a craving. 
I got a hell of a girl. "
You have to actually want to quit. Knowing you should quit isnt enough. 
"Track how many days you have quit and how much money you are saving/ how many cigs you're not smoking. I use an app called cessation nation. Reset it when you smoke. I used nicotine gum and regular gum but try not to trade one vice for another, your jaw will probably get sore from chewing a lot of gum. Do something about your cravings that will keep your mouth/hands busy and be ready to fight those cravings when you know they will be the strongest. Try not to drink alcohol. Don't be afraid to get angry, you're bigger and stronger than a cigarette. Having people to support you is a plus but you can quit on your own. If you fail try again and again until you finally quit for good, never give up. Took me three or four times to quit. Good luck, you can do it."
Remember if you succeed you only have to do it once. If you don't succeed you have to do it again and it is no fun.
"The two cup method, I found it here on reddit, and have been smoke free almost a year. "
Like an old man I had a bag of candy next to me at all times after I quit cold turkey. I bought candy that had a kick  like jolly ranchers and sour patch kids. Anytime I was jonesing for a cig I would have one or hundred. Slowly stopped going for a candy over time. 
"Here’s what I did.
Cut back to 1 or 2 a day for two weeks.
Stopped completely.
Chewed gum.
Yelled at a coworker.
That’s it."
"If it hasnt been said already, Champix really does work. Its side effects are not as scary as some would lead you to believe. Also, you need to want to quit. If you don't want to actually quit, you better find a reason to."
"I recently started smoking again after quitting for 2 years, I know I need to quit but it’s one of the few enjoyable things I have."
"I had to quit drinking as well to do so. Other than that, gum, candy, and A LOT of patience. Cravings made me super agitated and pissy for some time. Just have to walk it off, shrug it off, whatever. I'm roughly three months done and cigarette's are just now starting to smell gross to me. "
"Quitting smoking to me wasn't a long term plan. When I quit, I told myself to worry about the daily craving battles. Forget about going weeks or months without a cigarette. Instead, focus on the craving. Tell yourself that if you say no to the craving it'll be gone in five minutes. There may be days at the beggining where you have to tell yourself no 10 times a day. Eventually though you'll crave them less and less. It may never go away, but you'll learn to manage it. Good luck!! "
Vaping saved me.  Being able to cut the nicotine slowly 
"I had to convince myself I would die soon if I didn't quit. I also kept telling myself that other people were able to function without cigarettes. I quit drinking for awhile, so there were no drunken weak moments. I held a pencil in hand like a cigarette when I drove. No breaks at work. But mostly fear of death. I saw my mom die of lung cancer at 51, and it is NOT pretty."
"I started smoking to help me quit my self harm ‘addiction’. Once that was under control I also wanted to stop smoking, but the hardest thing for me was to accept that when the occasional shitty pangs of depression would hit extra hard and I’d usually either resort to hurting myself or smoking, I would have to smoke to get through the day. It took me a year and a half of not-smoking except a cigarette or two every few months, and that’s okay. Even now I had a smoke a month and a half ago, and that was the first in a year or so. I haven’t had the urge to restart that addiction.
Don’t think you HAVE to quit cold turkey and never touch one again. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you do slip up. Just acknowledge it and keep trucking on. You got this :)"
"Vape
"
"I quit just at random one day, after having tried quitting many times before with planning, so one day instead of buying cigarettes I decided to buy nicotine gums, I powered through the next couple of days with a bit of restless sleep but it got easier after I'd say about a week, then I took up vaping and have never looked back :) that was 2 years ago now!"
"Have specific places in which you feel strong enough not to smoke and expand upon those places as you progress. For example, quit smoking in the car and then quit smoking during the work day a few months later (and so on). Also, take it day-by-day. When you quit-quit, on those bad days say to yourself ""I may have a cigarette tomorrow but I won't today"". When tomorrow comes, tell yourself the same thing until you no longer need to consider it."
"Just *quit*.  There is no fancy tips or tricks to just *quit*.  
Yes, it’s hard.  And those radio commercials that convince you it’s too hard to quit unless you buy their products are just making it more complicated than it is.  All that’s doing is make you think about quitting and smoking and quitting and smoking, it keeps “smoking” at the forefront of your brain.  Just stop smoking.  
Stop buying them.  Stop sitting outside at restaurants.  Stop hanging out outside doing nothing.   Stop hanging out with people who just want to sit around and smoke.  Stop giving yourself opportunities to smoke.
STOP going into convenience stores at gas stations.  You know damn well that there is nothing in there that you need, and you’re just entertaining the idea of buying more smokes.  Don’t even *try* to convince me that you “need” Gatorade or Doritos.  You know what else is in there?  Smokes.  And you know it.  Don’t even set foot in there."
"I quit by transitioning to Vaping.  At first, start Vaping and keep smoking cigarettes.  Yes! Do BOTH!  This will get you used to Vaping as it takes awhile to warm up to it.. a lot of people try Vaping and quit smoking cigarettes right away and their throat isn’t used to doing something like Vaping yet and it feels weird... so the go back to smoking.. but I am 100% serious, do both until you are comfortable with the Vaping and then gradually ween off the cigarettes until you’re just vaping.  I Vaped for a year or two going from 24mg of nicotine down to 1.5 mg.  When I finally started weening myself off of the Vaping the withdrawal is only a tenth or so of what cigarettes were.  It’s way easier to quit Vaping then it is to quit smoking.  "
It's been 4 years. I still get get slight cravings a few times a year. Don't give in.
"Sorry you are going through that, it’s terrible to see what happens to people when they go through it. 
My mom was diagnosed and gone within 30 days. Sucks we had such little time with her in the end, but it always felt better than it getting dragged out for a year and watching it tear her apart slowly. 
"
"I really hope my parents quit smoking. Kids, don't start smoking."
"Stop.  
 
I know this sounds like a sarcastic response, but it worked for me. Just stop. "
"My mom has no choice but to quit when she got a disease that destroyed her lungs. She was told by her doctor she would die if age ever smoked again, that’s how bad her lungs were. Ironically- the lung disease was not related to her smoking at all but that’s a different story.
She and my dad broke it together. I think it helped then both that they were quitting at the same time. They got by by sucking on suckers."
A book called the easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr. Easy read in 08 and got passed around to friends. No one has smoked since. Even a cigar with a little taste of a buzz won’t throw you off from quitting cigarettes. Totally worth the time to read (not much)
"I quit a few weeks ago, and by quit i mean i decided in my head that i would not buy another smoke, not even one. I still have one a day because people are ready to give to me, but i dont buy any and i wont let myself. 
I think its just a matter of deciding you are going to do it regardless of what you go through, and even though i smoke 1 a day, getting to that was one shitty ride. "
I always kept some in the fridge and in my car. Cuz having no cigarettes around always made me want to have one.  My craving disappeared and I replaced it with chewing gum and staying busy.
"Degenerate smoker of 20 years here, 2.5 packs a day. I quit in one try, and I wasn’t even serious about it, just did it on a lark.
Vaping, use the e-cig setup(narrow neck, not fat nozzle for making big clouds) it simulates the hit you get from a cig draw in your throat. Next, get vape juice with nicotine in it. With my habit I started out at 24mg of nicotine, this was way to much, shoulda started at 18mg. I stayed at this level for 4-6 weeks, then stepped it down six mg at a time every 4-6 weeks till I hit zero. Continued for two weeks, then started to leave vape at home, not take it with me to work etc etc until it was just pointless doing it at all, only took three weeks and I gave it all away. 
Cigarette and vape free for three years and a bit. I don’t miss or crave it at all."
Stop It! [stop It!](https://youtu.be/Ow0lr63y4Mw) 
"I had to use a vape to slowly back down on nicotine over a few months. People make fun of them, but it saved me after 7 years of a pack a day. Now I’m off altogether!"
"Realize it's the mental things that are hardest.  Before quitting start delaying one.  Find another way to take a break.  Stop smoking in your spot and make it less comfortable.
Try and figure out why you smoke.  Is it stress or boredom?  And realize it's a process.  Don't let anyone shame you if you slip.  Pick yourself up and do it again.
Finally, you aren't trying to quit.  You quit.  By trying you give yourself an out.  
Remember, every day is easier.  Take the time to realize what is easier or more fun now!"
"I smoked for 17 years - from the age 12 to 29.  I starting dipping skoal about the same time I started smoking.  Any time I had to be inside for a long period of time (such as in college classes), I would dip and just swallow the spit.  Ultimately, I had one habit, an addiction to nicotine, that I was servicing in two different ways.   I had tried to quit cold-turkey many times during those years but never succeeded.  Finally, I became resolute about my intentions to quit.  
I had heard that ""if you quit before you're 30, you won't suffer long-term effects.""  Since my addiction, wasn't as attached to certain body motions - raising my hand to my mouth to take a puff, reaching for a pack of cigarettes in my shirt pocket, etc - I easily convinced myself that all I needed was the nicotine.  Then, I started on the patch - telling myself all along that I was getting my nicotine, despite it being in a different way from dipping and/or smoking.  For about 2-3 days at each transition phase - starting the patch or switching to a lower dose patch - I would feel cravings, but then, they would subside until the next transition.  
I was in graduate school at the time, and I continued to do everything else the same - hanging out with friends, having drinks, not avoiding smokers, and otherwise engaging in my normal routine.  I didn't change my lifestyle to quit smoking because I knew deep down that, if I did change my lifestyle while quitting, as soon as I tried to get back to ""normal"" stuff, I would find myself wanting to smoke a cigarette because somehow it ""went with that activity.""  Finally, I got done with the last step down in the patch regiment, and I continued to go about my life.  I'm now nearly 40 years old, and I've never smoked a cigarette since then - although I have smoked a blunt from time-to-time rolled in a cigar wrap.  I will NEVER smoke again.
I wish everyone the fortitude to succeed in quitting nicotine.  You can do it.  I'm now watching my dad die slowly because of it.  He started when he was 7 years old.  Don't let your (future) kids see you die this way. Please.  "
"I'm not 100% sure because everyone is so god damn different.
Smoked a pack a day for 6 years, and I used a vaporizer to help cut back the cigarettes.
One night I was drinking and playing rainbow six siege in 2016 with my buddies, and ran out of smokes.
Well now I'm drunk, so I can't drive, and I'm enjoying my friends' company, so I just hit my vaporizer 2-3x as much. Woke with a hangover and no longer wanted cigarettes...
My only take away is that if you get a vaporizer to quit smoking cigarettes, hit it a lot. Use it religiously.
Yes I know vaping isn't good because you're still addicted to nicotine, but it was a really big step I didn't even mean to to take"
The hardest part for me was the daily activities associated with smoking. i would always have a cigarette on my way to work and coming home from work and generally any time i drove. so when i was driving was the times i craved it the most because i built that habit of always having a smoke. what helped me was associated something else with the driving like chewing gum or singing along to the music. 
I found that separating the physical and chemical addictions helped. I used the patches and let my body heal from smoking. You get a nasty cough as your lungs heal. Then I tapered down the patches into smaller and smaller surface areas. You can start with the strongest patch and cut it into smaller pieces. Then get the medium patch etc. sipping cold water whenever I had an urge to smoke. helped me.  I smoked for 8 years and quit 20 year ago. 
"Decide to quit, don't tell anyone so it's easier to do it one day at a time. Check out the Alan Carr book The Easy Easy Way to Quit Smoking and just do it!. You'll save a fortune and smell so much better!"
"I think you have to just really truly want to. If there are still parts of you that like the social or whatever aspects it’s gonna be really hard because you’re forcing yourself to quit doing something that A) you’re addicted to and B) you don’t actually WANT to stop doing. Idk, I finally got to a point where I was like, this is gross and a waste of my time and I don’t want to do it anymore. I no longer longed to be a part of the pack of people freezing outside smoking at the pub. So I guess this is shitty advice but I guess I’m trying to say maybe work on your mental psychological attachments and start thinking of yourself as a non smoker and changing your habits and it’ll make getting over the addiction easier"
Quitting for me was really easy with the help of Wellbutrin (which I take for depression) and nicotine gum. When I started taking Wellbutrin cigarettes started tasting really bad and didn’t satisfy me as much. I do crave cigarettes after I eat meals but that’s where the nicotine gum really helps. I also had to quit drinking coffee because every morning I would start my day with a cup of coffee and a cigarette. Now I drink tea for caffeine. I feel so much better not smoking cigarettes! 
"Keep busy. Most people smoke as a habit, so free time seems like the best time for you. 
   Stay busy and keep around places where smoking is either prohibited or frowned upon. "
"I started smoking at 15 and quit at 32. Sometimes I smoked 5 cigarettes a day, sometimes 2 packs.  When I quit, I had no intention of quitting and I have no idea how I did it. I just know that you have to spend a lot of time sitting. I remember feeling like, if I get up, I'm gonna smoke, so I'm just gonna sit here until it passes. I carried a pack of cigarettes around with me for months. I kept a pack of cigarettes in the freezer for over two years. If I thought I couldn't do something without smoking, I just didn't do it.  I seriously stopped doing everything that made me want to smoke and slowly, one at a time, relearned to do those things without smoking. Also, I noticed that I smoked when I was angry, so I had to come up with new ways to handle being angry. Almost 12 years as a non-smoker now and I am super happy about it!"
Move somewhere really cold and only smoke outside. 
"I know it has a stigma but I switched to vaping. I cut down on my nicotine levels over time. I still vape, quitting vaping is a whole new thing to face now, but it's cheaper and I don't feel so out of breath so I'd say it was better than a lateral move at least. "
Keep a written tab on how much you spend monthly on cigarettes. It encouraged me that my money should be spent on better things.
"Get an aspire breeze. Very cheap, lasts long if you take good care of it, and salt nic works wonders for stopping cravings. Just slowly lower the amount of nic over time."
Quit drugs and alcohol first. 
Work for hospice. The number of people I saw who were dying while gasping for air.... not a pretty way to go :(
I quit with Wellbutrin. Let me be very clear. Wellbutrin is not for everyone and I’ve heard a lot of horror stories. It is the only thing that worked for me and I didn’t have any negative side effects. From looking online I’m in the minority. 
Getting pregnant helped me quit the first time. Aside from the obvious baby related issues it made me nauseous so easy to quit. Fell off the wagon several months after baby was born. Quit again when I went on wellbutrin for depression. No cravings and over a decade smoke free now. 
Mini Nicotine Lozenges have changed my LIFE! 10/10
"What helped me the most was: stop drinking and stop hanging around your friends that smoke and drink, at least for awhile. "
Remember what life was like before you started smoking? You coped just fine then without cigarettes and you can now too.
"Here's how I quit my pack-a-day habit: start working in places that allow indoor smoking. This is awesome at first cause you can also smoke inside to your hearts content. But then time goes by... everything reeks of ashtray even more now. You may even been to associate smoking with your drag of a job or maybe even your nasty customers. You start smoking less and less until one day you just quit. No nicotine for 2 months straight. You pick up a vape and now that you've had some time to untrain yourself from cigs, your fine just getting your nic fix from the vape.
**Also**: don't try to quit by just picking up a vape and hoping to taper off cigs, everyone I saw do that just wound up smoking cigs and a vape with no reduction in amount t if cigs they went through. It may have worked for some, but IMHO you should have a gap period if possible. But hey, trust your instincts!"
My dad says try vaping 
"Document that shit. Even if you don't post it to social media, take a video of your ""last cigarette"" and make it the first one of the pack, it'll give you something to be forced to live up to. And don't try to wean yourself off -- just make the decision and do it. For me, I increased my consumption until I was smoking two packs a day, until I was practically sick. And it worked. For me. Maybe weaning works for others."
"Successfully stopped smoking for 4 years after 9 years of heavy smoking.
1. If you can - don’t tell anyone that you decided to stop smoking. This is for “social smokers”. Whenever someone asks you to go smoke a cig just find any excuse to avoid it or still go, but just spend time talking to people and don’t smoke (hardcore level to test yourself).
2. Swap cigarettes to drinking water or eating an apple.
3. Stop buying cigarettes at all. 
P.S. If you smoked for a long period of time you will have the thoughts about smoking till your death, learn to live with it. Don’t judge yourself if you lasted for only a week, proceed with another week of smoking free and try doubling this period, eventually you’ll drop this habit.
What are the benefits? Food tastes better, you don’t spend time on useless thing, you save some money, waking up in the morning feels better, you have a better performance in sex.
Downsides: none."
Chantix with food. Omg with food for gods sake. 
Dont tell people you are quitting. Talking about quitting gives a false sense of achievement that can interfere with long term cessation.
"Smoke joints instead, no seriously."
"First, you have to want to quit.  Second, the physical symptoms of withdrawals last for about 3-4 days, so push hard to get over that plateau.  Whenever you have a physical craving, go exercise, even if it is just a 5 minute walk.  Use some sort of substitute when you are in the car, either gum, hard candy, or sunflower seeds.
After that initial period, the issue becomes breaking the habit.  Do you smoke after you eat?  Pick a new habit afterwards.  
Then you are on cruise control for about 3 weeks.  Around week 3, you will experience really intense cravings again.  This was the hardest part for me.  It is all psychological.  Stick with the new habits you have been forming.
You dont have to tell yourself that you are quitting forever, just that you aren't going to have a cigarette today."
"When i quit smoking i bought a fireaxe and firewood. Cut wood when you want a smoke. Or dig. Either way, youre going outside and accomplishing something, kind of like finishing a ciggy"
Put a cage over your head and give the key to your wife
Ya gotta want it. Once you truly want to quit you will. For some that day never comes. 
You will fail a bunch. Don't be hard on yourself about it. Keep starting again. Forever.
"Understand that your brain is an asshole and will try and use anything to convince you that you need or deserve one more cigarette. Fuck that guy, he is a liar and you can't trust him. Don't give in. It really does get easier. And use aids. Gum, patches, quitline, friends that you can call and freak out on because you just want a damn cigarette. Use these to get you through cravings. It makes a huge difference."
"Biggest is you have to want something more. I also lied to myself. I just said it was temporary, that is be back smoking in a few days then a few weeks then a few months.
Also don't expect the cravings to stop ever. I'm 11 years in and barely go a day without craving one. "
"Don’t try. Do, or don’t. Wanting to is easy. Until you can say, “I will never smoke again”, don’t try. Fill a pack of cigarettes with cut straws and keep it where you normally carry them. Remember, you only have to work at quitting during the 5 minute cravings, which get weaker and less frequent. Remember, nicotine stays in your body ~6 months and slowly leaches out of fat cells. After that, it’s not physical addiction but psychological. The first two weeks are the hardest. Change certain routines up that normally trigger smoking. "
"I used the patch and some candy. The toughest thing for me was not going back when I got drunk. It's never ending though... It has been a long time, but every once in a while the thought of having a cigarette still creeps up on me."
Just go get lost in the woods for 2 weeks with no people joining you. Then when that evil little shithead of a voice makes you angry; your the only one around to be angry with. 
You can always rationalize smoking another cigarette. If you are waiting for an excuse to smoke you will find one.
"just stop smoking eventually you won't need to anymore
"
"A year and a half smoke free. I smoked for over 40 years, so I’m home one evening with a bad case of bronchitis and puffing away and coughing my lungs up when I said to myself, this is fucking crazy. Dropped them right there and then. 
It’s different for everybody, it’s almost like being an alcoholic, you can’t help them til want it. 
My biggest tip is if you don’t want to have a inhaler in your pocket 24/7  or dragging an oxygen bottle around quit ASAP. 
My bank account has grown leaps and bounds since I quit and I only gained 20 pounds. Good luck. "
"Be around non smokers. It becomes a little embarrassing. Even though they aren't judging you, your paranoia about them judging you will make you stop."
"Go find someone with COPD (emphysema and chronic bronchitis) who is stuck to an oxygen bottle 24/7 and can't even walk from the lounge room to the kitchen without being extremely out of breath.  Looking at that scared the HELL out of me. I saw my future right there.
"
"Don't tell people you are quitting, just do it. You're doing this for yourself. "
"Cut down for a few days and then quit -- cold turkey.
No matter what you try -- nicorette, patches, Zyban (Bupropion) or Chantix ( Varenicline Tartrate) -- you are eventually going to have to stop. You might as well stop now as later.
&#x200B;
Know that you only have to tolerate withdrawal for 72 hours (3 days). After that time, your physical need goes away. You will probably always have an emotional need, but you can live with that."
"I smoked a pack a day before I quit.
I went to an Incubus concert where I had front row tickets and an open bar. I chain smoked the whole night and drank my face off like a wedding reception all while screaming along to every song. Next day my throat felt like I’d gargled gravel.
Switched to a vape for a month to help heal my throat. Then went out drinking with a bunch of coworkers. Got dropped off at home, my ride offered me a cig, I smoked two in quick succession.
Threw up a whole bunch. Never wanted to smoke since, stopped vaping too. Friends smoking around me always smells great but i have zero desire to smoke whatsoever. Been three years next week!"
"Spending more time with non smokers and less time with friends that do smoke. I found, in my case anyway, my friends who smoked had plenty of other bad habits, like drinking too much ect., that I shouldn't really surround myself with anyways "
"I quit with vaping however, people who say vaping is cheaper than smoking are only somewhat true ;)"
"It can help to disassociate from the addiction.  its a mental circut, put there by nicotine, that takes over every few hours or whenever, and it only wants nicotine.  Your thoughts are bodily functions, really, and this is one from a parasite.  it takes your money, time and health, but you can starve it out.  
Quitting apps that calculate your savings and show you your streak seem motivating as well.  
Vape shops sell slim pod-like refillable e cigs that cost almost nothing to refill, and have variable ammounts of nicotine are also a great alternative/tool.  I dont like juuls, they seem like a marketing scheme designed to prey on the buying habits of cigerette smokers."
Have your mother die of a piece of shit sneaky type of cancer and be disgusted with yourself that you’re voluntarily sucking down these cancer giving sticks. 
"Not a smoker, but smokeless (Copenhagen), not sure about advice, but I can tell you my quitting experience (I chewed A LOT, for 25 years).
I just quit.  The first week wasn’t  bad, but weeks two through four, I was miserable.  Sleep patterns, metabolism, even joint pain, but I made it.
I, honestly dreamed, regularly, about taking a dip for a year.  Every now and then I still dream about it.  It has been three or four years now, and I have never caved in, but no longer have the cravings, but I still love the smell when someone around me opens a can.
Tobacco is bad shit."
"Chantix. You will hate the taste of cigarettes within two weeks. Some of the side effects can be harrowing, but it’s only temporary and you will guaranteed hate cigarettes if you take them correctly. "
I quit after smoking for a decade by switching to a Juul (e cigarette). Hardest part was not lighting up when I’d have a drink but I just powered through and now I don’t have any urge to pick up a cigarette. 
"Spite. Imagine someone who would love to see you fail and quit out of spite just to rub their face in it. Worked for me. My ex made some comment about how everything in my life seemed to be going better since she walked. ""Let me guess, next you'll quit smoming?"" BOOM! All I needed. Haven't had one since 2007."
I smoked for over 20 years. Here's what did it. Cigarettes have additional addictive chemicals in them that make it even more difficult to stop. I started smoking American spirits. They don't have additional chemicals and are as strong as shit. One cigarette and you don't want another for a while. Thats what helped me eventually quit. I know it sounds wierd to say in order to quit smoking smoke something else. But it worked for me. I was finally able to ween off smoking and I honestly attribute it to not smoking the additional other addictive chemicals.
"Almost no one quits cold turkey and almost no one quits successfully on their first attempt. 
I've had some success with nicotine gum (and no success with patches or pills like Chantix) but vaping was the easiest way to never look back at cigarettes. Get yourself a nice vaping tool and you'll never look back at cigarettes and it's a lot easier to quit vaping than it is smoking (at least for me).
A cheap eCig from the gas station isn't going to be enough. You will likely need to feel like you're smoking which only a powerful battery can provide. You're going to have to spend about $50+ on a nice enough vape but it's a hell of a lot cheaper than cigarettes in the long run. 
A lot of people like Juuls but they weren't powerful enough for me and the cartridges are too small (If you do go the Juul route, be sure to get refillable cartridges, you'll go broke buying the official replacements).
And ignore everyone who says vaping isn't safe. It may not be 100% safe but remember that you're on your way to quitting and they're a hell of a lot nicer to ""smoke"" than cigarettes. I can't stand cigarettes anymore, they're so gross. I smoked cigarettes for 14 years."
"My therapist told me to ask myself the following question when I took out a cigarette, “Why do I want to hurt myself?”  After about a half pack, I stopped smoking. I kept that other half in my glove compartment for months before I chucked it. When I reached for the glove compartment asking the same question, I had an answer, that I wanted to stop hurting myself.   It has been 20 years since I smoked. "
"I likely have the least interesting story. 
Where I live winter is ridiculously cold; None of my friend's want people smoking indoors, and I wasn't going to lower my own property value by smoking in my house either.
A friend let me borrow a Vape, specifically a MVP2 with using a Kangertech tank and sub-ohm coil. I never smoked another cigarette after that first week; I was getting my nic-fix and not smelling like smoke (Though occasionally I smelt of obvious candy flavours)
I bought juice online and, every month or so, I'd juice step down the amount of nic in my juice until I eventually just had flavored air.
Flavored air is infinitely easier to drop than a cigarette.
However: Don't assume that a vaporizer is safe or healthy, assume it's on par with what you were doing and use it as a tool to step down. If you have the willpower, just stop cold. I didn't, and needed a vape. Maybe you won't."
I smoked on and off for 17 years. Like most people I tried to quit many times. I was always able quit for a while but I always went back to smoking. One day I woke up and i spoke like someone had shoved gravel down my throat. Turns out I had developed Polyps on my vocal chords. It took me over a year to get surgery. After that I never lacked the motivation. It's been three years. Never again. 
Chantix.  It works. If you think it won't you probably don't actually want to quit.  Worked twice for me.  First time for a year then bordem in Afghanistan got me  but have not smoked in 5 years. 
"I licked out and switched to an electric cigarette.  Then I got strep. I hadn't used the thing in 10 days so I thought, why go back. I'm at 5 1/2 years and I am so happy I stopped that horrible habit "
Get pregnant.
"First of all actually want to quit.
Then, just stopped smoking the opposite way I started, smoking less and less each day until it faded. Most times I had the urge for 1 minute but I would just stick to it and now I don't have it anymore. 3 years already. Don't avoid the things that get you the most urges (coffee, eating a lot, alcohol, etc) because as soon as you get them again you'll fail miserably."
Keep your hands busy.  I crocheted for 2 months and made a huge blanket.  Will be a 3 year quitter in November.  You can do it!
"I just made it inconvenient to smoke.  I had just gotten a new car so I definitely wasn't smoking in that, and I didn't want to smoke in my apartment either.  So pretty much the only time I could smoke was to go outside and just stand doing nothing but smoking.  Once winter came I was smoking one or maybe two cigarettes a day.  At that point I just quit."
"Read a book called The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. This is by far the easiest method to quit smoking, you don't have to quit smoking from the get go, you can continue to smoke whilst reading the book, in fact it is encouraged not to stop smoking until you're instructed to in the book and trust me, you'll want to quit before this point. Give the book or go, you have nothing to lose but so much to gain. (Btw I've successfully quit using Allen Carr's methods, I stopped cold turkey and was in a sense, set free. My eating habits are better, I suffer from far less anxiety, my wallet is fuller lol and overall I feel great as cliché as that sounds, could not recommend the book enough)"
"The key to quitting smoking is to decide that you are not a smoker. After that, everything else is just a chemical reaction. Every time you start to get grumpy (or just plain freak out), remind yourself that it's just because you don't smoke anymore. Eventually, you won't have to remind yourself because the reactions won't be there.  
Getting to that point is another matter. For me, the winning strategy was delaying that first cigarette a little but more each day. I realized that I smoked cigarettes based on a fairly consistent schedule that began each day with my first cigarette. So, I started delaying that first cigarette, and the cycle that followed, just a few minutes each day. It got to the point that I was spending more time outside of the cycle than in it. 
&#x200B;
That made the day I decided that I wasn't a smoker much easier."
Honestly. Nicorette gum made it really easy for me. It’s been like 10months for me. And I’m never going back. 
"I've seen a bunch of people on here saying the most important part is actually wanting to quit, I completely agree with that. But for me to quit was all about will power, it was a simple matter of picking a pack as my last one and trying to make it last as long as possible and once I was out, I was out. Not buying more or asking to bum cigarettes off of friends, if I went into a gas station I wouldn't look at the cigarettes or go outside with smokers when I was craving one."
"I vaped like a motherfucker.  Started at strength 12, went down from there."
"Subscribe to r/stopsmoking, download the Smoke Free app, and of course, just stop lighting up. Peace"
20 years and 3 packs a day at my worst. I quit using a method from Dr Oz. Get a stop watch and divide your day into number of smokes. So one pack a day would be one cigarette every fifty minutes or so. Your only allowed to have another cigarette after the stop watch hits 50 minutes. Do that for a week. Then add five minutes to your time. Repeat till your able to just stop. The best part for me with this system was it removed the triggers. It greatly reduced the anxiety over when I could have another cigarette. I could just check my clock and know relief was coming. Hope this helps someone. 
"Get bronchitis for 2 weeks, immediately followed by the flu, immediately followed by bronchitis again. It worked for me..."
Have a kid. My wife wouldn’t let me hold her unless I showered after having a smoke. 
"Quit once for three years, quit again for going on two years now. Tried patch and gum, didn't really work for me. What did was 1) strong pressure from my partner at the time (aka, knowing I would catch shit of I smelled like smokes around my kid), 2) strong disincentive at work (resented it at first, but having to go to the ass end of the building was a pain) and 3) taking meditation breaks, focussing on deep breathing for 5 minutes. This helped manage some of the physical experience of withdrawal, gave me permission to take a moment out when I couldn't focus on work in a moment of brain fogging, it also helped by feeling life affirming. 
Second time, my kid was a big factor. New partner not down with it, so similar incentives. Was able to take up cycling to work, replaced a smoking obsession with a cycling obsession, found that being able to breath was really helpful. 
And practical: first 3 days are the worst for physical dependency. If you can make it past that, the physical discomfort lessens and it's a mental game, but that's a game that you can get better at. 
Good luck, meet you on the other side. "
"Impractical advice... But go to sea on a submarine for two months and don't bring any cigarettes with you.  They taste terrible when you get back in Port.
Course, I had to do that twice to actually quit, but the second time stuck. Haven't smoked since 2006, but I still occasionally dream I had a cigarette yesterday. Wish that would go away. "
"I kept waking up in the middle of the night being unable to breathe. It scared my wife to death. So, I did it for her. Swapped to a vape for 6 months. Finally dropped it. I slip up occasionally. I’ll have a cig after a few beers. But, I haven’t hit the point where I’ve needed to buy a pack. That’s when I know I’m fucked. "
My tip.  Dont have the first one in the morning.  Im 24. smoked for 9 years.  3 weeks cig free. 
"Don't cut down. I tried so many times to just cut down, until there were only 2 or 3 a day... They will become so much harder to shake. For me it was Waking up, after dinner, before bed.
Just go cold turkey. Maybe throw in vaping if you're struggling, but never cut down.
Edit - also the most powerful motivation after you've begun quitting is to remember this. You remember the relaxation or the itch this scratches? It's not doing anything but removing the withdrawal and satisfying a habit. By quitting, you'll stop having an itch you need to scratch at all.
I'm my 4 years being smoke free, one bad day I thought I needed one to relax me. I didn't get half way through before I realised it was making me feel shitter, not better. "
"Cannabis and Kratom both help with withdrawal. In my experience. Not that you can do either, just thought for anyone who can, this might help. 
Kratom tea twice a day was key for me for a while. But I now use it every 6-8 hours for pain. 
Cannabis helped a great deal in concentrated form (pens). Slow deep breaths and it replaced the hobby with something that helped. For most this could mean thc however CBD has helped significantly as well. "
Chantix all the way
"Put as many barriers between you and your cigarettes as possible. Driving was a huge trigger for me, so I kept my cigarettes in the trunk to limit my access. Just like with any addiction, you gotta identify your triggers and be proactive in avoiding/diverting away from them."
"Chantix worked well for me. 
6 years and still no smoking. People say it has bad side effects but I havent had any"
"Figure out if you're a ""I like to have something to with my hands"" person or a ""I like to have something to do with my mouth"" person.  For me, it was a mouth thing.  Chewing altoids all day really helped me get past the cravings of the routine of needing to have something for my mouth to do, which I missed long after the physical cravings for the nicotine went away."
"I stopped caring a lighter and hated asking people for a lighter.
That made me stop.
I only smoke socially now but I never feel the need to smoke or buy a pack. "
Vape
Starting vaping did the trick for me instantly. 
"Get pregnant and then breastfeed for a year and that should get you through the cravings phase 
But seriously kids are the best motivator "
"I quit twice. The first time it was because of a girl that wouldn't date me if I didn't. Getting through the withdrawals was easy but after 3 months of being off of them I started to get wild cravings for weeks every time I saw or smelled a cig. I was smoking again the day that person and I parted ways. Worse too, I was smoking a pack to a pack and a half a day instead of the half a pack a day I was smoking the first go around. I quickly moved from the American spirits I had been used to smoking before to camels, parliments, and benson & hedges. I know other brands aren't technically aren't more addicting than Spirits but it sure felt like they were. If I was out partying with my friends I'd buy like 3 packs and be out of stogs by the morning.
For a long time I was doing that and I didn't even want to quit. Then I bought a 1 ohm vape and started vaping 50 mg salt nic out of it. I have no idea why I did it, I think I had tried a juul while I wasn't smoking at some point and enjoyed it on it's own right and wanted a vape mostly for fun. I did not want to quit or reduce my cig intake. 
Immediately on that day I began smoking half of what I used to without thinking about it. I don't think I even noticed I was smoking less, I remember being confused one day when I woke up and had almost a full pack left from the day before. Salt nic is a different beast than regular eliquid, it actually satisfies the urge to smoke. After a while of doing both I realized I didn't feel like shit if I went for 8 hours without a real stog. And not just not feeling a little less shitty than I would without the vape, I literally wouldn't even notice I wasn't smoking! I kept up buying them for a while because I enjoyed them but after while I got tired of spending the money and suddenly I would go days between packs with out even noticing. When I realized that I just stopped buying them. I probably could have quit the day I bought the vape if my intention was to quit, I don't think I would have even gotten a headache from it if I had. I still love the smell of cigarettes but it no longer makes me feel a burning need for like a week after exposure. I still can't believe that the vape worked so well that it made me quit without wanting to. 
I hope to quit vaping one day, but for now it works for me. My asthma has become manageable, my lung capacity seems to have greatly increased, and it hasn't even been a year since I quit. That's the reason I no longer take one off stogs when I'm offered, my lungs feel like shit for a few days if I take those. If you don't want to quit, pick up a vape for the hell of it and maybe it'll just happen."
I've been off cigarettes for 2 weeks. Getting a vape helped a LOT. 
Chantix.  Done.
"I got hypnotized, it cost me forty bucks and I never looked back. Its been 11 years. I believe I really wanted to quit so my mind allowed me to. It was rather easy frankly but I know everyone is different. good luck. "
"I smoked 30 yrs i was ready to quit, 1 visit to a hypnotist it was over. It's been 10 ago now ."
"Ask yourself if you are a bitch every time you want to smoke.
Does not work if you are a bitch."
"There are a million “ways” out there. It’s really whatever works for you. I had a friend who’s suck on a cinnamon stick, he claimed it satisfied the oral fixation. Others did the patch, or gum, or just sheer epic willpower. One marked a calendar 6months out and said “I can smoke AS MUCH AS I WANT until this date, then never again” was still off it last I checked. Whichever way you go, just keep at it!! Good luck dude."
Vape 
"I don't know what works for you, but here's what worked for me. I had enough with the bad smell, I had enough with feeling short of breath and one day I said no more and that was it. When you realize that you truly are better of without smoking, you understand and agree with yourself, then own up to your resolution and have the conviction to act of your own volition and accord and never smoke another cigarette again. And a day will come when you don't crave it anymore, when you're around it and you won't care. That day might take a while, but when it comes you won't even realize it but on some random afternoon when, looking back, you'll think to yourself ""Hey, it's been quite a while since I used to smoke. Nice."" And that would be it, you will be free from it long after realizing it. "
"Quit several times, but would always go back after a few months. I quit drinking as much and stopped going anywhere I knew there'd be a lot of smokers. It helped a ton. Then, my then-boyfriend(now fiance) told me I wasn't allowed to kiss him if I had smoked, so that was the very end of my ""cheat smokes"". It's been about 6 months and I still crave one now and again after a big meal or more than a couple drinks, but I just have to remind myself it's not worth it.
 I took a drag from someone the day after my friend committed suicide because I thought it would help and it killed my throat and my lungs; not at all the taste or feeling I remembered. You just need to keep yourself away from things that make you crave them and find your motivation for quitting. 
Like others have said, just because you slip up doesn't mean it's the end. It just means you have a chance to start again. "
"Change your habits. Used to going outside for a smoke break? Go outside for a short walk. Or sit inside in your phone. Just change it. 
And don't wean off them. It never works and it's just an excuse. Go full or go home. When you quit it's one or two weeks of hell, random anger, headaches, and cravings, but after the withdrawl abides you should be good. If you get cravings during that time try waiting 20 minutes before giving in. Sometimes you'll just forget you had a craving. Didn't work? Pop a nicotine lozenge into your cheek, but don't overdo them. "
"I was down to one or half of one cigarette a day, and I could not let it go. I worried about weird stuff ""who am I if I don't smoke?"" ""This is such a huge part of me and my personality, what will I do?""
In the end I got pregnant and it make it reallllly easy to put down that one last butt.
I used one of those quit smoking apps that showed me how much more life I had and how much money I saved and that was very helpful."
change your mindset “i am no longer a smoker”
"More of it is in your head than physical.  The craving for a cigarette has been compared to the irritation of a mosquito bite.  Were it really as much stronger as it may seem, you would never be able to sleep.  Mind over matter.  "
Take a mason jar and fill it 2/3 full of water. Then put about half a pack of cigarettes in the jar. Whenever you get a craving just pop open the lid and take a wiff. Sure as fuck worked for me. 
"I took up tea-tree oil toothpicks. Quit pretty painlessly, now I don't even use the toothpicks."
"Get pregnant hahaha, but seriously, that is how I quit. I got pregnant, nursed for 2 years and am pregnant again. I can't stand the smell of smoke now. My hubby started vaping two years ago and it works for him."
"I used to smoke two packs a day and wouldn't start till 2 in the afternoon. I was never addicted, just an ass. Somehow for me, whenever I wanted to quit, no problem. My ex, she couldn't go from one room to another without the cigs, lighter and ashtray. She quit. You have to want to quit, for real."
"It really is a physical addiction.  The best thing you can do is wean yourself off of nicotine.  Get rid of all of your cigarettes and buy a vape.  Get some high nicotine shit.  Enjoy yourself for a few months.  Then reduce your nicotine juice by one level per month until it's 0.  Keep vaping even with 0 nicotine.  One day, you'll realize you forgot your vape and you don't care.  That's what I did, haven't smoked anything in 2.5 years."
Got a vape. Haven't touched them since.
Just don't ever stop trying. I tried to quit dozens of times before I was actually successful. I smoked for about 18 years and I've been a non smoker for 3 years now. Most people won't quit in their first attempt. Understand that most likely you will relapse but keep trying.
"Started vaping about 2 months ago. I use a Juul. Takes some getting used to, but after a week I was already feeling a ton better. After a month, it's like I never even started.
Basically, it's not quitting, but it is better for you and will probably give you some peace of mind, plus make it a little bit easier to get out of the habit forming parts of smoking (such as getting up to smoke outside, or the hand gestures, whatever). Now when I go to smoke, it's maybe 5-6 puffs and then I'm done. Quitting at this point would definitely be a lot easier because I'm no longer going through the motions of smoking like I used to. It's more or less just a little time spent to get what I need and then get back to whatever. When I do decide, it will most likely just be an afterthought."
"How I quit and stayed quit. Hit it cold turkey. No tricks or cheats. Write down all the reasons you can find for quitting and post it somewhere in a space you're in regularly. Get an exercise program - running and kung fu were mine - so you can feel the need for healthy lungs and the damage done. Cut out triggers for a while. Coffee, alcohol, etc. Get rid of anything smoking related from your spaces. Clean out the ash tray in your car. I also used cordyceps, lions mane, and anise tincture to assist but I can't say that will work for everyone. It was an essential piece for me. I've been quit for over 10 years. Things that screwed me up the first two times? Smoking blends, trying gimmicks, and weaning. I am a firm believer that the suffering of quitting cold turkey helps the brain and body develop new patterns of behavior. Be resolute. Do it for your health. Do it for those who care about you. Do it because it's a horrendous waste of resources. "
"Watch this video. I've been smoke free for 2 months now and haven't even wanted one after smoking for 25+ years which also included a chewing tobacco habit. 
https://youtu.be/NmoLK_NUcVg"
"Living paycheck to paycheck REALLY helped start me on the journey to quit and after about a month, for me, the urge wasn't as strong anymore. 
"
"I don't recommend it but it worked for me, first get a job in construction, second get tasked with grinding the polymer out of the inside of a manhole cone. Even when wearing the mask it doesn't help completely, and it caused cigarettes to taste disgusting! So bad that as a smoker of 9 years I quit cold Turkey without issue. "
"For me I had to realize that the answer is no 100% of the time. No having one when I’m drinking, or on the weekend. The answer is no, every single time. Once I adopted that policy and stopped trying to justify the occasional one it got easier. You also really start to see the changes in your body in a few weeks. You can smell better, your chest feels lighter, things taste better. You realize that your body is healing. That really kept me from going back. "
Take a two week holiday vacation for quitting. Over eating won't do much(you'll just end up putting on a ton) so don't try killing anxiety with cookies just follow a balanced diet and don't eat anything else. You'll have problems sleeping so hungry ... just sleep whenever you can and wake up whenever you want (that's why the vacation). You may have to quit alcohol for a while because it diminishes your will power so it's harder not to smoke when drunk. Don't stand next to people smoking trying to sniff some smoke just walk away.  After two weeks all the physiological addiction is gone so then you just have to cope with the psychological for a couple of months. Maybe quit coffee cause a lot of people associates it with tobacco and will make you more nervous.
"The only thing that worked for me after 23 years of smoking a pack a day of Marlboro Lights was vaping/ Not in that new cool way but I found a mod and tank that mimicked cigarettes with the right volume of vapor and nicotine to work off cigs slowly and surely I made smoking illegal in my house we had smoked inside for 20 years or so. I have cut down from 18nic to 6 and honestly people make fun of the vaping thing, and I get why, clouds of cotton candy gross, but it has worked the best for me I work in a corporate office and I can go take a few quick hits in the bathroom without anyone noticing and I'm not late for the next boring board meeting. Highly recommend it."
"Just do it, cold turkey, now. You dont need a last cigarette."
"Pick a nicotine replacement and use it until you feel sick. Everytime you want a cig, dope up on nicotine. "
"Might get buried because the thread has been up for a bit, but for me it worked when I had an almost full pack of cigarettes I crushed them up and threw it out. In my mind I would think “wow am I really going to throw out almost an entire pack and waste all that money just to buy more?” Worked for me going cold turkey. Running a bit and seeing the fast improvement helps too."
"What did it for me was the combination of strong motivation and nicotine replacement.  
My then two year old daughter was having frequent ear infections. Her biggest reaction in allergy testing was tobacco.  
The second last time I quit smoking I had horrible withdrawal symptom. Very depressed, lay on the couch not wanting to move.  I knew the next attempt would need nicotine replacement. 
I talked to my family doctor, he prescribed Nicorette gum (It required a prescription back then).  4mg to start, then down to 2 mg a while later.  Part of the trick was to read and follow the instructions. (Chew a piece of gum when you get a craving, slowly at first unless you want a burning sensation down your throat.) 
Don’t be like my brother-in-law who went on the patch then ended up smoking while wearing a patch.  He quit a few years ago, he developed some major health issues that forced him to quit.  
It’s been 28 years since I was a pack a day smoker. I almost never crave a smoke now.  I breath easily, have no cough. I am very infrequently sick with cold or flu.  I don’t smell like stale smoke.  My daughter stopped having frequent ear infections as soon as I quit. "
" Use what is available to you. 
The first time I quit, I quit for like 3 years using a vape pen, slowly weaned myself off that until I used nothing for like a year. After I had my kid my head was all messed up and I went back to smoking... que quitting round 2. 
This time I used the patch and gum and they  really helped with the cravings. I wasn’t one of those people that could just quit cold turkey, and I know it’s hard putting up the 50-80 dollars up for 14 patches and a box of gum, but they work. 
You have to want to quit. Choosing not to smoke is a active choice I have to make every day. 
Best of luck. "
Eat a cigarette every time you smoke one.
Same way to deal with addiction: Get rid of smoking people and smoking places. I started hanging out with recreational runners. You'll soon get tired of the neverending talk about shoes.
"
Don’t fuck around with nicotine gum or patches or anything. The nicotine addiction is still there, just the mode of delivery has changed. Just do it cold turkey. The first few days will probably be pretty nasty but then it’s over. 
Also for anyone that is open to a power greater than themselves and feels utterly powerless over quitting. Just ask that Higher Power to take away the desire to smoke. Just ask for this every day and don’t worry about it after that. If you’re still smoking don’t worry about it just keep asking the Higher Power to remove the desire to smoke each day. Don’t assign a time frame to it or beat yourself up. One day you’ll realize you got through the day without a cigarette (or other nicotine delivery device). The addiction will just have been removed. "
my goals to achive something were bigger then desire to smoke a cig.
Getting pregnant is the only thing that worked for me. I smoked the first few (3?) days after I found out and finished my pack then realized it was making the morning sickness worse. I quit by just not buying another pack and now I'm 23 weeks pregnant with perfectly healthy twins. 
dont smoke
"Ha I was just gonna say that (I don't smoke btw, but I damn sure aint gonna start. Costs too much money anyways)"
"Have you tried not smoking? Did it for me.
&#x200B;
 Actually i used wellabutrin, i just completely lost interest in it and stopped."
"Honestly, just stop smoking. I smoked for 9 years; half a pack to a pack a day. Got tired of feeling like shit and paying for cigarettes. Just stop. Have some will power. It's all mental after a few days. "
"Decide on a quitting time/day you are comfortable with, when you are ready. Commit to it. Then no tobacco of any kind. Use gums, patches whatever but no cheating with a cigarette here or there, or a drag or once a week, nothing. and you'll do it. "
"I smoked for years, but never in my car.  I started dating someone pretty far away and couldn't make the drive without a cigarette, so I started using chewing tobacco instead.  Don't smoke anymore, but now I always have a Snus or some long cut in my lip.  Not sure if this is the advice you're looking for.  "
"I just started slowing down a few at a time, cut the smoke from the car into work out, then shave a break here and there. I went from a pack a day to half a pack in 6 months, then about 2 months later a pack ever 3 or 4 days. The final push for me was getting a 2/3 week chest cold/cough that made smoking miserable and feel like a chore, I was smoking like 3 a day so I was like this is dumb, I'm gonna just stop while I'm this close. That was January 3rd and I haven't smoked since. 
"
"I know everyone else is saying this, but you really do have to just be ready and want to do it for yourself. After a horrible night of binge drinking and chain smoking, I woke up so disgusted with myself that I was just done. I’ve slipped up here and there but no longer have the regular daily cravings. Good luck to you!"
"I (29 M) quit smoking cold turkey two years and four months ago. I was an off and on smoker for about eleven years, mostly on. I wouldn't say I was a particularly heavy smoker, but a pack of American Spirit blues (my preferred brand) would last me maybe a few days - unless I had a night of wild drinking, in which they would go very quickly. I remember the last cigarette I had, and I just simply told myself that it would be my last cigarette. I am not sure I really believed it at the time, but I didn't buy another pack after that, and I just sort of continued to not buy anymore. It was weird - I had many failed previous attempts at quitting, and normally something would come along after a little while and trigger my desire to cave - drinking with friends, a good song, a big exam, a job interview, etc.. or even that good feeling that everything is going well and the weather is wonderful and life is great and a cig would just be icing on the cake... This time I kept reminding myself to be strong. I always knew I never wanted to be someone who smoked forever, and I think I convinced myself that if I didn't succeed this time, then I never would. Also, for personal family reasons, some of this incentive was a bit reactionary. If you care about your reasons strongly enough, then you can quit. I can honestly say that I do not have even the slightest desire to smoke anymore, and even the smell of it bothers me a bit now. I think also after 6 months to a year in, it gets a whole lot easier to remain nicotine free. Best of luck to all quitters!"
I was meaning to do it for a while. I got the flu and could barely breathe. I went outside(in the winter) tot smoke and nearly collapsed after the first drag. Thought that might be a good time to quit. I was passed out in bed for the next few days so I slept through most of the withdrawal.  The week after the hardest thing was not smoking after meals but I figured out that if I snack instead of having meals I don’t get that urge. That was around 8 years ago and I never started back up. I sometimes smoke when I drink but I don’t drink often.
I slowed down how much I was smoking before I finally quit. What helped me to slow down was to switch to a brand that I didn't enjoy so I had to want to smoke really bad before I actually would. 
Late to the party. The thing I found most challenging about quitting was the sensation of inhaling smoke. I found that vaping helped. 0 nicotine worked for me. Ended up quitting vaping after like 9 months. Haven’t had a cigarette since. Good luck!
Cold turkey. It wasn’t easy especially being around a ton of smokers. I waited until it was winter and I got sick though. That helped. 
"I got on birth control, and if I smoked then it would increase chances of blood clot and dying. That was enough for me, especially since the sex was worth it. Even though I’ve had cravings, I think about how many times I tried to quit, and how often I would dream about being where I am right now. "
Get pregnant. 
"I was at 3 packs a day .I stopped completely and never smoked again.
  You have to quit for yourself , nobody else is as important as you
 Take it 1 minute at a time , if you feel the craving , tell yourself that you can wait another minute and stick to it .
  Do not replace smoking with food ,that's even harder to break. Drink water instead. 
  Just just 21 days is all it takes to break a habit or to create one.  
Most importantly, stick to it , your life depends on it.
 "
"You have to become a non-smoker. Your identity is built around smoking....tell me you really liked the taste when you started....you started, most likely, as a teenager, for identity reasons...it was ‘cool’ to smoke. Now you have to cleanse yourself of that identity and create a new one that doesn’t smoke. Not easy-best of luck-hang in there, keep with it!"
Smoke weed instead of cigs 
"I quit smoking after I had pain in my chest when lying down in bed and also realised I could use the money on something more potent than cigarettes.
I mean... Why spend thousands of dollars to something that doesnt even give you anything in return"
"A couple of years before I actually quit, I started telling myself, ""After dd/mm/yyyy, I'll be a nonsmoker.  I can smoke my head off until then but after that I'm not a smoker any more"".  When the day finally arrived, I was ready, nicotine gum etc, I've never looked back."
"Smoked  25-30 a day for about 18 years. Picked up a vape and accidentally quit smoking. Been over a year now. Had single smokes 3 or 4 times and hated every one of them. Just have to make a point of watching the nicotine intake.
"
Sipping water with a little baking soda helps with the nicotine withdrawal. 
"6 years done as of this Christmas...
You've got to REALLY want to do it.
You've got to really want to quit forever.
You've got to be prepared to take the necessary steps (avoiding people, situations and substances that make you want to smoke)
You can't do it half-assed, like allowing smoking on weekends.  All in.
You've got to give your friends/family/significant other warning that you are going to be a total ass and they're going to have to deal with it... but at the same time you can't use quitting as an excuse to be an ass.
You've got to reward yourself from time to time, you'll have some extra money to throw around.  Try to avoid spending it all on food, though.
One more thing, although I had initially intended to quit a couple of weeks later (on my birthday) I caught a bad cold during the holidays and just didn't feel like smoking for about a week.  By the time I started feeling well enough to smoke again, I already had the time in, so I just went with it."
"Accept that it's not going to be easy. On the bright side, you should be over the worst within a week. Distract yourself from cravings by telling yourself you will have a cigarette later -- just not right now. Might help a little."
"Get your tonsils out. When it's too painful for you to take your pain meds, it's much too painful to smoke.
This was, of course, after slowly switching to just vape pens (early style with tiny fluid chambers), extra swelling and issues during recovery from the surgery. 6+ weeks of not wanting anything near my damn mouth that wasn't to keep me alive? I wasn't willing to go back. "
"I quit because I am dead broke now. Couldn't afford a cig so I was like why not just quit then?
For real life advice tho, never accept a fre cig from your friend when you're quitting. For me I only met with my non-smoking friends for a while and it definitely helped. Remember, a real friend would never give you a cig when you tell them you're quitting, only smoking buddies do, and smoking buddies are pretty useless in your life imo.
Another tip I could give you is to also quit drinking. Drinking makes you want a smoke dearly."
"Every night before you go to bed, think of every single cig you had throughout the day and tell yourself ""i did not have to smoke that cigarette."" be sincere, you really did not have to have it. Don't berate yourself, it's not about shaming. Eventually during the day when you go to grab a smoke, it will just click. You will not just say, but realize that you do not have to have it. Giving up smoking is not easy, but this exercise worked for me in giving up a lot of addiction."
Get heartbroken. Didn't even notice I was quitting after 3 weeks. So I just continued a decade now.
"When my wife and I quit, I just didn't buy them.  I just didn't go into gas stations for a while.  I'd get gas and stay outside.  That's what made it so easy.  
Honestly, the easiest way to quit is to actually want to quit and to decide to quit.  "
Chantix.  Don't be a bitch...  Be stronger than the side effects...  Be stronger than the drugs...
Do it for yourself and no one else. Be strong and stick to it no matter what. Find something to replace the cigarette/cigar/etc like a pretzel rod to simulate the motion because it's about breaking that habitual motion as well. Ask friends and co-workers to call you out if you head for a smoke break. Do anything that you think will help you because you know yourself better than anyone else.
"Chantix really works, unless you are in the minority that have bad mental reactions to it. It just completely stops nicotine from activating your addiction response so you just quit because it does nothing for you.
Vaping does work in a strict sense to get you off cigs. Beware though that you really want to stop inhaling stuff into your lungs completely, besides air, not just swap it for something slightly better. "
"Quitting smoking is easy, I've done it a thousand times.  
That's the old joke. But in reality you need to just want to quit.  Not, you want to because you know you should type of thing. You need to want it. That was my major factor when I quit. And when I decided, I just did it. Cold turkey. And it wasn't easy by any means, but just wanting to was enough to get over my obstacles.   
I know, that doesn't sound like help. It is though, and it's the best help I can give.    
But the backup to it is to know your triggers and habits.    
After a meal was huge for me. It was awkward to not smoke after a meal. So that was a challenge, I acknowledged it and knew it would be tough. So I made sure to bed prepared for that moment.   
Driving was another big one. But that wasn't too bad because I could focus on the actual driving.  
Social smoking was really tough. Others are smoking...I smell it, I want it. It's right there. Got to say nope. Hopefully some friends can back you too. 
Visual cues are huge too. I remember being about 3 weeks in and I was watching a movie and the lady was smoking in her car. Oh that made me want a cigarette. Smoking is highly visual so expect some moments like that.  
Stopping smoking is a change. That means you are changing. You aren't just stopping something, you are changing your mentality and physical habits. That's freaking hard. Know that, accept that. You're training yourself to be a new way. Think if it that way to better understand it, and be successful."
Take up vaping :(
I used a website that trackrd your daily progress and told you the health benefits and $ saved
was a pack a day smoker a month and a half ago. would not have made it through the beginning without nicotine patches and regular chewing gum.
"The urge to grab a smoke never goes away completely. After 18 years, I still get the urge every now and then. You just ride through it and the urge goes away. "
Stop buying cigarettes. 
"My gf smoked for years before she met me. When we met she had been cigarette free for about 5 months and she had switched to vaping. Since vaping, she can’t stand cigarettes and is now actually switching to a lower nicotine vape and weening herself off. I’m very proud of her."
"I tried a couple times. Using gum and patches worked for a bit, but I never kicked the nicotine habit. Finally successful just going alone. Not feeding the nicotine breast let to a miserable few days, but after a week or two the craving lessened and I found myself closer to quitting than ever before. I'm three months smoke free, I feel good and smoking is never on my mind. I think going cold turkey broke the habit faster than using replacement therapy."
"I used whole cinnamon sticks to suck/chew on. And when I didn't have one in my mouth, I used a whole clove to roll around in my mouth and eventually chew on and swallow.  The clove kinda had a nice numbing effect.
This works because it keeps the tongue busy. "
"https://whyquit.com
This helped me quit cold turkey 12 years ago. Understanding the stages of withdrawal was helpful too.  The worst was over in 3 or 4 days."
"I identified why I really did it. I knew I didn't like the mouth's taste afterwards and the feeling of clotting my breath.
You know, in this modern life we got satisfaction from very few things, there's not much sense of satiation for anything but basic needs like peeing, eating, sleeping well you know?
So when I smoked I satiated a need, I feel the satisfaction of dropping the anxiety of needing this thing and my day felt much lighter, I also associated it with headspace and an exteriorization of a melancholic image but this was secondary.
 The day I realized I just liked the satiation I cut it off for good. Plus you fucking save sooo much money."
"I went to the dr. If You can afford smokes, you can afford chantix/zyban. 
One month smoke free."
"Here is what worked for me: I did not say to myself that I will never have a cigarette again, ever. I said, I won't smoke one today. The next day, I said the same thing and after a few days, once you established a bit of a track record, you don't want to smoke just so you don't have to start all over again. 
The hardest part for me was about a month in. Stressful things happened and I was dying for a smoke and was having a real fight with myself. Luckily, I did not give in and once I made it through that period, things became a bit easier. 
The thing is, you can't let your guard down. I've been cigarette free for 23 years, but I still crave one, especially when I walk into someone else's smoke cloud. 
Be strong. It's a competition with your weaker self, but that self is a persistent mofo, so you have to be strong. Good luck."
I’m now 2 months without smoking (pack a day for at least 5 years). The thing that did it for me was vaping and decreasing. It’s literally the only thing that worked after countless tries. 
"Start bodybuilding, sick and tired of having bad breath. "
Lozenges 
I couldn't find any tricks to do it for me.  What worked in the end was good old fashioned wanting the fuck out of it.  Went cold turkey one day in 2012 and that was that.
"Change your routine. When I quit, the hardest time for me was in my car. I *always* smoked as I drove. I tried to avoid driving as much as possible for a few weeks. Took rides, kept myself busy. Driving was my trigger and I took steps to avoid it. Find yours, and find how to handle it. "
Vape. Went from smoking to vaping to quitting both because they are both expensive and one is extremely unhealthy. 
"Vaping. I quit once cold turkey, and suffered terrible withdrawal symptoms like insomnia, fever, fatigue, etc. It didn't really last long. One big thing that will help, more than vaping or cold turkey, is your environment. If your friends are all smokers, you're gonna have a hard time. If you're the only smoker in the group, and smoking breaks are nonexistent, it's easier to give them up. "
Cut out alcohol and avoid smokers
"All you need is a good reason that will make you stick to not smoking. For me, the birth of my son is all it took for me to stop cold turkey. Not to say it was easy but i had a great reason to stop. I kept a pack of cigs in the car to show myself that i could always get one if i wanted. Happy to say my reason for quitting was stronger than the urge."
Start Vaping. 
"Try quitting, try again and again and again even if you don’t think you are ready to quit (but want to). Very few people quit successfully the first time. It took me about 6 serious attempts and now it’s been so many years since i’ve smoked that I barely remember being a smoker (feels like that wasn’t me!)."
"It's never just one pull or one smoke while drinking. Those count and your streak of days without should reset to zero.
Keep that in mind and don't cheat. One pull resets your count. "
"Toothpicks helped me realize I wasn't addicted to the nicotine, just the ritual of smoking as well as the oral fixation. 
Also kicking one addiction is easier if you find another, more helpful/less destructive addiction to replace it with. "
"I smoked 1-2 packs per day for about 5 years. I then started rolling my own which instantly cut the habit to about 1/2 a pack a day and saved a ton of money. I continued this for 5 more years then quit cold turkey at the same time I quit drinking and doing hard drugs.
 Not sure how I did it but it was probably easier because I had a real problem with drugs and alcohol to motivate me to just go completely clean.
 After a year I started smoking and drinking again but have only smoked pot a handful of times since then and haven't gone back to hard drugs. Drug and drinking problem in check, I went the next 10 years drinking occasionally and rolling 5-10 cigs per day.
I tried to quit smoking a few times with traditional methods like the patch, gum and lozenges but that only ever lasted a few weeks at most.
I decided to switch to vaping. After about 1 year I had transitioned completely off cigs and was vaping with a high dose of nicotine.  After another year I slowly weened myself off nicotine until I was vaping 0 mg.
Taking out the nicotine completely wasn't easy but the motion of vaping and blowing out massive clouds of vg definitely helped.
For a few more weeks I vaped with 0mg nicotine. I used about 4x as much juice to compensate but it was enough to curb cravings... Mostly. It still sucked.
I then finally decided to stop vaping completely. I had got to the point where I was vaping 100% vegetable glycerin with no nicotine and not even flavoring. I was still addicted to the motions and was really fed up with it beause at this point it seemed really ridiculous because the psychological aspect was so apparent. I finished the last of the pure vg so I wouldn't be tempted and didn't buy more.
It's been about another year now and I haven't vaped or smoked at all and it feels so good to be free of the monkey on my back.
It was still really hard, but vaping and lowering the nicotine dosage over time made it WAY easier than when I tried to quit with traditional methods.
TLDR, Anyone who says vaping isn't a good way to quit smoking doesn't know what the fuck they are talking about.
"
"Have a goal. I gave myself a goal. 21 days. That's how long I needed to break that habit and I took it one day at a time.
Carried LOTS of gum. Lots and lots of gum. Every time I had the urge I would chew. 
It's been 10 years for me now, haven't touched it and don't even crave"
"Take the days one at a time. Focus on not giving in today. I found when i thought about not having a smoke for a couple of days or some lengthy period of time it was daunting and then i would discourage myself. When I focused on today it didnt seem so bad because all i had to do was last the day. Iv been doing that for 6 years now, its been hard  but it does get easier with time. When it gets tough make sure you have a friend or family member to call and just talk too, dont be discouraged or hate yourself if you do give in any progress is progress, throw away all smoking items you own (lighters, ash trays, smokes, etc) and tell yourself that you can do it because you are in control. As crazy as it sounds, for me speaking to myself and telling myself that i can do it was quite helpful, like a mini pep talk. "
If you are at home and you get a powerful craving and you do t think you can get past it instead of getting more cigarettes jump in the shower. By the time you get out the desire should have passed. 
Alot of others have good advice. But one of my main ones is don't drink for a bit when trying to quit. 
"Morning yoga... Last thing you'll want is a cigarette. Wasn't even trying to quit at the time, though I tried many times before. Yoga puts you in a content mood that is nonexistant when trying to quit."
"Step 1 - remove everything that reminds of you smoking
Step 2 - never join a friend that is having a smoke, and move away from their area so you don't smell the deliciousness
Step 3 - I started to chew lots and lots of gum, plus bought an ecigarette
Step 4 - Do some exercise, because I gained a ton of weight in my case"
"I just made myself vape until I enjoyed it more than cigarettes and now I do that. No plans to quit that, though. I dunno if it's the right way to do it, but it worked. You can quit the vaping easier than the smoking if you want to, too. I'm still addicted to nicotine, but overcoming just the obsession with everything else about it was big for me and I'm not dying as quickly anymore. "
"If you vape, throw away your vape. Shit’s expensive yo"
Don't live with people who also smoke. 
"It's all about not buying a pack. I allowed myself to bum cigs until I felt like a mooch. When id walk into the store wanting to buy a pack I would buy candy instead. A lot better for to curb a craving. Plus a treat for staying strong.
Also just remember all the reasons you're quitting. It's worth it "
"if youre quitting because someone else wants you to and you dont...youll fail. 
&#x200B;
Do not try to make too many changes at once. too many people try to do too much, they want to lose weight quit smoking, start running, give up  drinking etc all at the same time, DONT DO THIS.  youre only making your chances worse and your  stress rise, and what happens when we get stressed, yup you guessed it, we smoke.  Ive been  without tobacco for 22 years now  and if i hadnt quit, there is no doubt id be dead."
"1. I had to REALLY want it. 
2. Understand and reduce triggers (car, work breaks, drinking in excess)
3. Restrict places where I smoked to make it harder. (Not in the house, or garage)
4. I used patches for 2-3 weeks
5. I used gum for a month after that
fortunately I sold and purchased a new car right around the time I was trying to quit. Driving was my top trigger. 
&#x200B;"
"I haven't had a cig in 3 weeks.  I'm almost 60.  Chantix worked for me four years ago until I went to the beach with friends who smoked.  Just one cigarette with beers did me in.  At that time, I was a non-smoker when I signed up with my insurance, couldn't get Chantix again.  I may not have been honest with them since then but now I think this will stick...  Juul.  Takes a few days to get use to it and waking up not coughing gives you motivation.  
Try Juul.  It working for me.  You will always want one but this is a great alternative. 
&#x200B;"
I quit drinking for the first month. Everytime I tried quitting before I would cave about 3 drinks in. 
"Well, stop putting cigarettes in your mouth is a prime tip."
Champix
"1. Control your hands. It was hard to control the anxiety, but I was determined to be able to
Control my hands, and I wasn’t going to touch a cigarette. As long as I could control my brain and my
Hands, I knew I would be ok.
2. Learn to re-direct your anxiety. Every time I felt like  smoking, I would force myself to go to the gym. Not only I quit but lost a lot of weight that year. 
3. The first 3 months are the hardest. If you can pass that barrier, it gets WAY easier. 
Clean since 2009 after 10 years smoking almost 1 pack a day. "
"The only thing that’s been keeping me away from cigarettes is my vape. I started at 6 mg and I’m still at 6mg. The nicotine helps with my digestive issues on top of being generally my preferred vice. I had a small pen vape a few years ago and, compared to the setup I have now, I hated it too much to stick with it. All it took was one day forcing myself to only hit the vape and not compare it to cigarettes. It’s not a cigarette. It’s vapor with nicotine and a little bit of throat hit. Which is all I actually needed out of it. Good luck to you 👍🏻"
"**My story:** It took me seven years and five different attempts to quit. The first three times I quit for a few days but easily got back into the habit because it was also a social tool. I made a lot of friends from smoking outside my dorm and taking smoke breaks with a research faculty member while we worked together. This made it super hard to go about living my usual life without smoking. The fourth time I managed to quit for a few months but then the economy went bad, I extended by Ph.D. program by a year and finishing my thesis was nerve wracking. Finally, I moved to a different city, ended up with a pushy primary care physician who got me tested for everything due to my weight and found out I had type-2 diabetes. This triggered something in me. I dropped 60lbs, started walking 5 miles a day, armed myself with the education to battle this condition for the rest of my life and in the middle of this met the missing ingredient - my wife. She was the last bit I needed to succeed. I am not going to say that you need to find the love of your life to make it happen but it helped me get that last 0.01% needed to stay off. 
**The other 99.99% that helped:**
* Make a plan. Set a date.
* Give up a cigarette one puff before you usually would. Couple of days later two, then three.
* Start counting how many puffs you take instead of give up. Stop at half a cigarette. Then go down to a quarter. This helped me not give up or be too hard on myself when I occasionally went down to the filter.
* Augment smoking with a different activity. So walk four blocks before smoking. This helped with the compulsion to get up each hour and go outside when it came time to quit. Also, super healthy.
* When you get close to the big day, make sure you have something else that is big going on. For me it was my girlfriend (now wife) coming to visit me from out of town. I smoked my last one the day before she flew in. Then we spent the weekend together (newly engaged) and it kept my mind off the cigarettes.
* I kept going for my hourly breaks but walked instead, or got coffee, or made a phone call.
* After 2-3 weeks walk up to people you know that smoke. The horrible smell will turn you off so much that you'll never go back.
* Final, piece of advice - don't give up. You can succeed. It might take multiple attempts but it will be worth it.
It's been three+ years since July 19th, 2015. I occasionally get that feeling in my mouth when I think about smoking but I have never actually felt like doing it. Hope this helps you. I am rooting for you!"
"Rationing worked well for me.  Limit to 10/day.  After a few weeks, drop to 9/day, etc.  Within 6 months, you'll be stuck trying to quit just 1 per day."
"My husband and I quit smoking at the same time. We did 3-4 months on nicotine gum and soooo many boxes of hot tamales. We didn't go anywhere that had smoking inside like bars or restaurants and stayed away from friends and family that smoked. I slipped up once and had a cigarette in weakness but it just wasn't the same so I threw the pack away. We've been quit about 12 years now and we're healthy and happy. The hardest part of quitting for me was when I was bored, nervous, or uncomfortable. I used cigarettes to take my mind off things by giving me something to do. I had to find new things to do when situations arose like that. Instead of smoking I'd call friends, chat online, sing out loud (in the car), or when I couldn't do anything else I'd just count in my head picturing the numbers as I said them. I'd ride the craving out and then could get back to normal life. I think it's easier if you can find something to replace them, even if only temporary be it food, entertainment, friends, sleep, or exercise. Anything to get you over that craving. First two weeks are the absolute worse, you think you're dying. The first month or two you're still feeling pretty raw. I'd say once you're past the 6 month mark it's pretty much good as done. "
"I got a vape pen, and used it for about 2 months. You can slowly lower the nicotine level at your own pace while still being able to ""smoke"" something. After using the pen for a couple months it broke, and I took that as a sign to just quit, and now it's been almost 4 years."
Read Easy way to stop smoking by Allen  Carr. That’s all you need to do. Read that book. It reprograms your brain. 
"I used an e-cig for about a year, starting with a higher nicotine level and slowly tapering down to 0. I smoked cigarettes during this year too, but attempted to taper back with mixed results. 
Then I moved across the country and was working with a huge group of younger masters degree holding corporate folks, and literally nobody smoked. It was looked at as gross and dumb. I quit cigs and e-cigs instantly simply because of the stigma that I didn’t want to be associated with. "
Get disgusted about burning shit and inhaling that toxic smoke into your lungs
I quit cold turkey.......six times.  I caught pneumonia and couldn't smoke for a month because it tore my lungs up.  I didn't start up again!
"I used Tetris. Every time I craved a smoke I played a game of Tetris.  
I got really, really good at Tetris."
I've only been smoking a little over a year now. Only smoke about a pack a week. I plan on getting a juul soon and quitting cigarettes before I do any permanent damage to my body.
"drugs. sweet, sweet drugs. 
people have mentioned Chantix/Champix (Varenicline), I actually wouldn't mess with that stuff - everybody seems to be having the weirdest side effects, up to and including *full blown fucking psychotic breaks
Tabex (Cytisine) works the same way and the worst thing it's going to give you is some cold sweats. it also doesn't cost a kidney and a half, since the whole course lasts 25 days.
also! stuff like this will absolutely erase any nicotine tolerance, so if you ever feel like smoking again, pick something that's akin to fresh mountain air. after I quit, I still did light up recreationally, one or two smokes a week, but anything stronger than a silver Marlboro felt like quickly oncoming nicotine poisoning.
"
Get a prescription for Chantix. I stopped halfway through a cig about 2 days into it. Haven't even taken a cheat puff since then. In fact cig smoke repulses me anymore and it's been almost 10 years.
"1.Throw out all your smoking paraphernalia: lighters, ashtrays, coupons for cigarettes, etc AND all of your cigarettes.   All of it. In the trash. Bury it so you can't get it back.  Bury it deep. Now pour water and week old Chinese food all over it so it's ruined.
2.  Figure out your triggers (what makes you crave a cigarette). Food, alcohol, stress, parties, driving, coffee, sex, a certain place, etc.  Now, you may have to stop or limit that thing (or your exposure to it) until you can re-learn to do it (have a beer, drive to work, hang with certain people) without smoking.  This could take a while.  But the point is to not have any activities in your life that make you want to smoke.
3.  Figure out how much you spend on smokes a week. Now keep track of how much you will be saving by not smoking.  Decide on a prize for yourself you can only save up for and buy from not smoking for a while. E.g. a PS4 Pro is ~$400.  $6 a pack x 2 packs a week = 34 weeks of not smoking.  That means in 8 months or so, you can get a PS4.  YMMV depending on how much cigarettes cost by you or how often you smoked, but you get the point.

"Excercise, changed one habit for another"
"It's been 27 years, but i remember I wrote down why I wanted to quit (health, $, smelliness/hygiene, wanting to be a good role model to my newborn son) and kept that list with me in my wallet to look at it. I also set a date for quitting - and told people. Chewed gum. Toughed it out the first week and knew it was all in my head after that! 
Edit:  writing this makes me kind of want a smoke - but I won't. Quitting is a bitch. "
"Smoke free 23 years. These things helped me:
1. Throw away all your lighters and ashtrays.
2. Clean out any place (car, bedroom, kitchen) immaculately if that is a place you like to smoke. Scent it with a smell you like a lot.
3. Keep every minute of your day as busy as possible for the first two weeks. Daylight to dark, have something going on.
4. Do anything to occupy your hands and mouth. Drink lots of sparkling water or anything with a heavy mouth feel. Chew Gum- Eat extra if you don't think it will make you put on weight or have lots of low calorie snacks like vegetables.
5. Realize after two weeks you are well past the withdrawal phase. It is now about psychological dependence and socialization opportunities smoking affords. Toward that end, I steered clear of smokers for the first year or so.
Good luck! I am so exceedingly glad I had the chance to quit. I am certain I would have been dead had I continued."
"DO]on't buy the bullshit, go cold turkey. The nic replacements:gum, ecigs, etc. are just an invitation to go back and end up stringing you out. Be done. Quit. End the fucking chapter.  "
Just stop buying them. It's that easy. Three days later it's a bad habit lost.
"As many already said you **need to want to quit**, just understanding it would be good is not enough.  
If you have a little good reason (for me it was morning sore throat), go cold turkey, no problem at all.  "
"[Fisherman's Friend original.](https://fishermansfriend.ca/flavours.html)
You know that craving you get due the taste in your mouth (like after a coffee). Used to pop one in and the feeling to light one up was gone. I think mostly because my mouth had that strong flavour that *I knew* it would clash with a cigarette. It helped during long hours of work. Helped when I decided to quit. Which by the way I did cold turkey. Quit after 13 years in a day. That was 10 years ago. Still kind of proud of myself with that :)
Edit: I should add, that I don't mean a menthol/eucalyptus candy will do miracles and make you stop smoking. But in my case, it helped a lot. *Really wanting* to quit is paramount."
"Wash all your fabrics multiple times and fabreeze what you can’t wash. That should be done for days and days and days. I was lucky enough that when I quit I had great support from my family and my mom was the one that told me to gather up everything to be washed. Also keep the fabrics outside until that whole process is complete. 
Understand that by quitting you are picking a fight with your brain that will last about 2 weeks and it will be a hard 2 weeks. You will go from happy to rage in no time flat and it will be for the dumbest stuff. 
In the beginning you will need to try to avoid smoking situations like beer and a smoke or coffee and a smoke. But you’ll do it and be fine eventually. And most importantly Good Luck!!"
I quit smoking because I really wanted to have a baby. I quit cold turkey and my husband helped me through cravings for the first week ish. We went out for milkshakes A LOT that week. But after about 4 days it got a lot easier and god it's amazing not smelling like stale cigarettes. 
Alan Carr 
"Don’t try to cut down, it doesn’t work. If you cut down then each cigarette becomes more rewarding, you enjoy them more, you forget how disgusting they are. It’s almost best to smoke double right before you quit so your last memory of smoking is the disgusting effects it has on your body. Also, use the patch to get through the physical withdrawal, but remember that the patch doesn’t help with mental addiction. It’s a tool, not a magic bullet. Finally, exercise. "
"Going to the gym, doing cardio did help me a lot. The more stress I put on my lungs ,more I realised the damage of years of smoking."
"I quit when i was younger, smoked for about 6 years.
First, I really got into working out and smoking made me feel really bad. So that helped.
But mainly I am a cheap ass. I bought a pack for 7 bucks one day and as I was smoking the first one I felt bad and so I threw the whole pack out the window. To this day, almost a decade later, I cant justify buying another one.
I smoked before the FSC ""Fire Safety Control"" laws added basically glue rings to the cigarette every couple cm that made it smoke evenly and quit burning when you didnt inhale for a moment. Once they added that I started getting sick and quit. That was a huge point for me.
Edit: Forgot, I smoked weed also. Whenever I wanted a cigarette I would have a joint or smoke a bowl. Really helped me quit. Weird.
Also a lot of people are using psilocybin or LSD or other drugs to quit and it seems to work wonders. Look into it."
Champex
Just cold turkey it bro best way. Just stop and never do it again. It’s that easy. Don’t waste your money on all the crutches they sell. Just do it!
"In the first few days of quitting a large percentage of your cravings are related to a sugar withdrawl and not necessarily a nicotine withdrawl. This is from not having your blood sugar spiked by cigarettes like you are used to, this is the reason smokers can get diabetes. Support yourself by eating sugar or drink juice when you are feeling the urge to smoke. This should primarily be done within the first week or so. I by no means recommend replacing cigarettes with sugar. Nicotine withdrawl is hard enough, sugar withdrawl on top of that makes it easy to cave. 
"
"I use to smoke a pack a day and I tried a couple of times. In the end I really wanted to quit, it’s expensive, I’m fit and it contradicted that part of my life and also my old workplace which was so even unintentionally pro smokers changed rapidly to no smoke so I had a lot of motivation. 
I did Champix for the second time, got an extension from the GP. I also tried to chew a lot of chewy just flavoured nothing special that’s what got me through the worst, initial six weeks. 
but probably the best advice I’d give to someone because it works for me is don’t have an all or nothing approach, if you’ve gone cold turkey for a month and you have a couple smokes that doesn’t erase all the work you’ve done. Just take it day by day and don’t smoke most days."
"Set a date that's not New Years day and stick to it. From that date forward, you will not have any cigarettes, period. Don't smoke any just for fun when you are at a party or having a drink with co-workers. Don't substitute smoking for any other kind of nicotine replacement like vaping or gum. Be aware of everything that will get you sucked back into the habit and just quit cold turkey. 
A big motivator for me was money. It also helped me that I was in college when I quit and I was broke. Think about the money you'll save. Buy yourself something after you reach a goal. "
You have to want to quit or else you will fail every time. At least that was my case
My parents switched to vaping and gradually decreased the nicotine in their juice.
"Find something else to do to occupy yourself, and a healthy snack to have instead of a cigarette. I hate having idle hands, and this is the biggest issue I have when I quit smoking. Going on walks helped too. Whenever I craved one, I’d go for a walk. Not the same, but pleasant at least. "
Zyban did it for me 
I would sit down in the shower and have the water extremely hot. It simulated the warm relief a cig would provide. It’s not easy but you can quit. You don’t need cigarettes...it’s not food or water. Just quit. 
"I knew I wanted to quit but wasn't there just yet. So I set goals. First, stopped smoking in my apartment. Next my car. Then stopped smoking after every meal. After 2-3 months of successfully doing those I started seeing how long I could go between smokes. After a few weeks of only smoking 2-3 times I decided it was time. So I switched to crack. Been smoke free for 10 years now. "
"you can go see your doctor and ask for champix to see if its legal in your country, its a medication that will cut the connection between your brain and the nicotine, to be honest i dont know the real science behind it but it does totally work. it will give you side effect at nigh like dehisydratation,nightmare, you need to keep smoking while taking the meds and after a day or 2 you wont event finish your smoke, after a week you wont event be smoking anymore because you wil feel sick and want to puke, and the day you will puke because you WILL, is the day you will stop smoking BUT keep taking the meds for the entire duration"
Salt nic vapes. Never smoked again.
"I have lots of advice about this. It took me seven tries to quit, but it got easier every time, and the last time was very easy, because I paid attention and learned from each failure. My logic was that there's probably many right things to do, but only a limited number of wrong ones, and so I tried to identify and eliminate the mistakes and focused only on that. I figured that I'd eventually run out of mistakes.
**Understand what smoking addiction is, so you know what you're dealing with.**
Smoking is most commonly regarded as a chemical addiction to nicotine. And it is, in part, and that part is powerful. BUT: Nicotine is a 'resident' addiction, meaning that you only experience withdrawal symptoms while the agent is in your system. When it's gone, you no longer have those symptoms. The level of nicotine in your system drops more or less geometrically: In the first few days, levels drop a great deal. After about a week, you're half clean. Another week or so, you're down to about a quarter. It takes about a month before levels drop to the point where they no longer have any effect. The symptoms of chemical withdrawal are about as strong as the levels. So it's bad the first week, then easier after that.
Unfortunately, smoking is much more than a chemical addiction. It's a **habit**. And habits can be harder to deal with than chemical addiction.
**You cannot ""break"" a habit. You can only let it atrophy, or replace it with a** ***contradictory*** **habit.**
Okay, technically, you **can** break a habit, but you wouldn't want to. A 'habit' is anything that you're so familiar with, you can do it without thinking, and feel an urge to do it. Many people report 'zoning out' on their commute and not remembering it. That's because if you drive the same route enough, your brain hardwires it so that you don't need to consciously think about it any more. Smoking is like that. It's hardwired into your brain. So you **can** 'break' a habit, but pretty much only in ways that are bad for your brain.
A habit atrophies if it goes unused long enough. Many habits are just muscle memory, and it could take decades for them to atrophy, which is why you don't forget how to ride a bike. If you wait long enough, the smoking habit will atrophy, too, but you might not have that long, and you might not be able to hold out that long.
But a habit atrophies much faster if you actively develop a **contradictory** habit. To successfully quit smoking, you need to actively replace the habit of smoking with a new habit of **not** smoking. Here's how you do that.
Smoking always takes place in some context, and most smokers have preferred times for smoking, as well as times they're less prone to smoke. These contexts become triggers telling you when to smoke. Identify them, and then deliberately deprive yourself at those times, to more rapidly erode your brain's association, reducing their effectiveness as triggers.
If you're like I was, you might be lucky enough to also have the opposite, times and situations when you **don't** like to smoke, when you don't find it enjoyable or it creates some kind of unpleasantness. If you do, then **do** smoke at those times. That has the effect of creating negative association with smoking, so that it's less desirable overall.
**If you can, quit cold turkey.**
Not everyone can do this, and don't feel bad if you can't. Everyone's different. If gum or some other device helps, use it. But if you can, quitting cold can help you quit faster, by getting the addictive chemical out of your system sooner.
If you're following a programme, then follow those instructions. Otherwise, follow a plan of gradual reduction, and slow the rate as you go to make it easier. This can be open-ended, so long as it eventually ends with zero.
**Forgive yourself if you fall off the wagon.**
It's extremely common to fail the first time, or even many times. You must forgive yourself. Beating yourself up over it only creates a negative association with quitting, which is the opposite of what you want. Just shrug it off and forget about it. Let each new time be a fresh new 'first' time.
**Don't pick an arbitrary time or date.**
Many failed quitters stopped smoking on New Year's Day. It's a very common and popular New Year's resolution. But it's not usually a good day for most people. Human lives are complicated. You must be ready when you try to quit, and if you don't feel ready, then you're not. If you've got shit going on that's causing you stress, wait till you're past that. Trying to quit when you've got other things causing you stress will just make it that much harder. Not impossible, but harder. If you can pick a time that's easier, do it.
**Stop cleaning your ashtray.**
Let the butts pile up. They're disgusting to look at, and that will provide negative association with the habit. Some people have found it helpful to dump the butts into a jar of water, and every now and then take a whiff. It's really disgusting.
Meanwhile, clean up everything else. Let everything that you **don't** associate with smoking be clean and inviting.
**Avoid social triggers.**
Quitting is made harder by the social triggers that you associate with smoking. Friends who smoke, places you like to smoke, that sort of thing. You may not be able to avoid all these activities and places for a whole month or two, but avoid them as much as you can.
**Once you're clean and no longer feel anxious, gradually reintroduce yourself to smoking triggers.**
It does little good to quit if you can't re-enter the smoking world without losing control. So while avoiding triggers while you're quitting is helpful, you also need to learn how to be around those same triggers without smoking, and be comfortable with them. Do this gradually, over a period of months.
**Be wary of replacement habits.**
Your brain will try to get you to pick up something else. Eating is a common one. Be consciously aware of urges like that. When you're feeling weak, drink water and do something physical to burn off the anxiety until you can sleep.
**You will cough. A lot.**
One of the counter-intuitive things about smoking is that when you quit, you start coughing more. Smoking knocks down the cilia in your lungs whose job it is to lift foreign matter out. That action causes coughing. So perhaps ironically, smoking can reduce coughing, by suppressing your lungs' natural self-cleaning mechanism.
Once you quit, the cilia start to work again, and they start working to clear your lungs. That will cause you to cough, and you will probably cough a lot more than usual for the month or two that you're quitting.
**Don't go halfway.**
If you were in the habit of smoking in the car, your car is now a No Smoking area -- for you and everyone else. Get in there on a sunny day when you can roll the windows down and air it out all day. Use a grease-cutting glass cleaner and lots of rags to clean all the creosote off of every hard surface. Use spray-and-vac to clean the upholstery, and minty alcohol to get the smell out of the carpets. Get an air freshener and use it for several months. Air the car out at every opportunity for the next several months. If you can afford it, have it professionally detailed.
Same for every part of your dwelling that you can get at and clean. This could take a year, but it's worth it.
Don't let anyone else smoke in these places. No exceptions, unless it's some really serious drama of some kind.
**Don't lord it over other people.**
Quitting is really, really hard, and some people never succeed at it. Don't ever make anyone feel bad about it, and using yourself as an example counts.
**DO offer other people positive and useful advice, if you can.**
"
Loose your job. Had no money and lived of my parents for a while. Went from smoking one package per day to zero in three days. Smoke free since 2015
Buy cigarettes you HATE the flavor of.  It really destroys the desire for indulgence smokes.
Eat more 
"Sweat, sweat your tits off.  I was a pack a day smoker for 20 yrs. I got bronchitis and was running an extremely high fever for 3 days, I sweat off close to 15 lbs.  the up side was that I had zero cravings or desire for a cigarette afterward. I’m around smokers all day, I even sit in a vehicle with smokers and am not bothered. It’s been nearly 3 yrs and it’s like I never smoked at all "
Mushrooms
I switched to snus for a couple of months.  It helps with the physical cravings but you'll need to change your habits and routines for a while.  
"A: you need to want to quit. For me, it was when I found out my wife and I were having a girl. B: just quit cold turkey. It sucks hard for a couple weeks but it gets better. Using patches, gum, vapes, and e-cigs will only prolong the withdrawal period and make you more prone to smoke again.  2 years smoke free after 20 years of smoking. I never want to go back."
Find a place/moment that you can't top to have your last cigarette. My last smoke was after the last house show/party at my friend's before they moved to another city. If I smoke another that will not have been my last smoke.
Run out of money
"You truly have to want to quit.  Quitting smoking is extremely hard but so worth it. One piece of advice is to never give in. 
I have heard so many stories of people who quit smoking for years and then started smoking again because they decided to smoke while they were fishing, drinking, playing golf, etc.
 
Also I don’t think this would work for everyone but for me I kind of tried to embrace the cravings.  THEY WILL PASS.
I smoked for 15 years and tried to quit many times and ultimately it was my health that got me to quit. I started having breathing problems.  I have quit since 2011. I also no longer get the once  a year bronchitis I used to get when I smoked .
I recommend staying busy and trying to keep your mind occupied with other things. "
I had to quit drinking alcohol too bc drinking made me want to smoke. Also just taking benedryl and going to bed early helped me
"Just stop
Say the last cigarette in this pack will be my last cigarette
I smoked for 22 years and decided I was done.
My wife thought I was FoS
Ten years later I’m still not smoking"
"Cold turkey worked for me, but it's not for everyone. Especially heavy smokers. I also found it easier to find another outlet. Something to do when you feel the need for a smoke. Get down and do some pushups, idk. Just something to take your mind off of it. "
"I quit after doctor found nodules in my throat. Turns out they were benign, but it was that reality check that helped me quit; the reality that smoking causes cancer. "
Get really sick. You’ll forget all about it since you can’t breathe anyway. 
"I used a vaporizer to quit and gradually worked down the nicotine content. I actually just quit the vaporizer 4 days ago, it's still hard to do though, takes a lot of willpower to drop anything nicotine."
"Chantix.
Nothing else worked.
Chantix worked the first time.
After a week I bummed a cigarette, smoked half of it, put it out because it was horrible. 
End of my relationship with nicotine. "
"I used an app on my phone and just dealt with it. I kept a “safety” pack just to be safe, because if I got in a car wreck or found out something terrible I would have to have a smoke. After about three-four weeks of not smoking I went to a bar and tried one of my safety cigarettes. It was disgusting! Never smoked again. 
The app was called iQuit I think. I smoked for 7 years and it really helped me out."
"Nicotine replacement was key for me.  The gum was not enough nicotine.  The patch worked well, but every once in a while part of it would come off, and I'd get shaky and terrible -- then a piece of gum to supplement worked miracles.  
Then the next trick to learn was that the patch actually made me fucking crazy -- after a few weeks at the same dose.  It got to the point where I could just cry for hours and hours and never feel better.  Out of sheer desperation, I took the patch I had and cut about 25% of it off (this decreases the dose by 25%) and that did the trick.  I wound up having to whittle down my patch sizes sort of every other day in order to stop the desperate crazy weeping, and stopped completely after doing like 3 mg/day for a couple of days.  
The other thing I had to learn was that I had generalized anxiety, and I had been using nicotine to treat my panic attacks, anger attacks and anxiety.  So I had to switch to zoloft, then lexapro, then klonopin, then nothing after about 10 years.  Still healthier than smoking.  
Last thing: in addition to nicotine preventing me from falling into a pit of anxiety, it actually also prevented me from feeling happy.  About 4 or 5 days after my last nicotine replacement dose, I could listen to something that someone said that was emotionally significant and actually feel something besides mild intellectual annoyance.  "
"Don't dick around. if you want to quit, quit. Don't slowly do it. Patches are useless, gums are expensive for no reason. The only trick to quitting is to actually want to quit. If you do it for reasons you don't really care about it won't work. Because there is no easy way to quit smoking. 10 years later I still get the occasionnal craving.
&#x200B;
Aside form that, chew normal gum to help with the oral fixation and find something to fidle with to occupy your hands. but those 2 tricks won't work if you quit half-ass."
"Hi there! I really wanna share my story since it is so recent! I quit smoking Almost 45 days ago, I've tried countless times beforehand. I smoked for over 10 years, pack a day, I honestly read 3/4 of the way through how to quit smoking the easy way by Allen Carr and kept a few of the brilliant things I read in the book in mind and would think about the feelings of a craving before the cigarette my thought process while smoking the cigarette and how I felt after, about a week later, when I decided to, I went cold turkey. I of course think about buying a pack, but I got what I wanted. Freedom from paying out the nose for lung cancer that I would have enevitably got. But you have to want it, there is no one better at lying to you than yourself.
Edit: grammer"
"You got to want to do it.   
Don't substitute another bad habit. Vaping, candy, chew, pop, etc... The best luck i had was every time I had the urge to smoke i picked up a straw and twiddled it with my fingers for a while and maybe chewed on it if i needed the oral fixation. "
"The Quitnow! App worked for me. Once I made it to like 3 weeks I'd open my phone every morning and see ""21 days..."" and I'd just be like... fuck, I don't wanna start over. 1,488 days later, number still getting bigger."
"Juul, bruhhh"
"First: you have to want to quit. That's not the same thing as knowing that you need to quit.
Second: Take Chantix. Don't listen to all the people crying about the nightmares.
Third: get ready for the nightmares. I had the most vivid horrifying nightmares of my life. Absolutely the most terrifying dreams I've ever had. Night after night for about a week, starting day 5 or so.
Fourth: be amazed at how well Chantix works at making you not feel the need for a smoke. You will be tempted to smoke, but all you have to do is tell yourself no, and the urge will pass quickly.
Fifth: take it for the whole 12 weeks (or whatever it is). Do not think about the cost (about the same as 2 packs a day ish) because you woulda spent the money on smokes anyway.
Final: be amazed at how much better you feel, even after 2 weeks without a smoke. I'm 18 months in and I feel 10 years younger.
You can do it. The nightmares are either free entertainment, or an excuse for someone who doesn't really want to quit.
Oh, and the nightmares will scare the shit outta you."
"A couple of things helped me kick the habit. 
- The first was understanding that my addiction was more habit and routine rather than nicotine itself. So I narrowed down where/when I smoked the most (which was at work for me), and eliminated smoking at home.
- I used to chain smoke 3-4 cigarettes during my breaks so, so the second thing was eventually working my way down to 3 ciggs a day. 
By far the hardest part of quitting was the social aspect, especially when you're drinking. This lingered for a few months and eventually turned into a very seldom activity until I never did it again.
Best advice I ever received: Never quit quitting! 
"
I joined /r/stopsmoking and I read Allen Carr's Easy Way to stop smoking.  Both things helped me immensely.
"Apart of really resolving to quit, I also realized that the urge to smoke was very momentary. If I thought about something else for a few minutes the urge usually went away. I pretty much learnt to distract myself with something else for the time being and got through the day. The toughest part was resisting the urge to reward myself with just one cigarette for having won the day or saying that I’ll just have one in the morning because I’m not smoking for the rest of the day.  That just took sheer willpower. "
"It sucks.
Sometimes I miss it.
You can do it... but it sucks."
"Much as the top comment from u/4Gotten1 says, you have to actually want to quit or, as it is in my mind, you have to actually decide to do it. There can't be any waffling or uncertainty. If you truly want to quit, you can just make up your mind to do it. I ""quit"" so many times but really, I knew I wasn't actually. I'd go a week and then go buy a pack because I wanted to. I fully owned and acknowledged that I was making the decision to buy it and smoke it.
When I finally truly quit, I had full peace of mind knowing I wasn't going to go buy them. Sure, I had and still do have cravings. I want a cigarette pretty much every waking moment of the day. However, I know I'll never go and buy a pack. I just won't. It's hard to explain but... yeah... you just have to decide not to do it. Nothing makes you smoke another one and break it. There's no magic in the world that wills you to do it outside of your own control. I think once you acknowledge that, it helps. It isn't a lack of self control, you just thought about it and made the decision to smoke it. It didn't just happen on it's own, out of your control. Once you get there, I think the quitting is easy. It was for me. I know it sounds kinda Zen and hokey but yeah, I really believe in it. Smoked for 10 years. Quit 7 years ago. Haven't smoked a single one since.
If you ever want what I call an ""accountabilabuddy"", just PM me."
"I think one of the biggest takeaways here is that everyone is different.
With that being said, I always had trouble breathing through my nose, so I usually didn't smoke when I was sick because I don't couldn't breathe.  Once I was ready to quit (the 7th time) I just didn't start up again after being sick for a week. Being sick and feeling like crap masked the initial withdrawal symptoms, so I only had to deal with the mental part.
The other thing that really helped *me* was I would ***chug*** soda water when I had a craving. Not soda, but just soda water.  The fizz and slight irritating of my throat really helped that craving/anxiety pass."
"My husband quit because he got sick enough to spend 3 days in bed shy of bathroom breaks, didn't even eat, just drank apple juice. He'd never been able to go 3 days previously so he decided to take advantage and not start again. I decided if he could quit so could I, I was sick for weeks but was too stubborn to give in because my husband did it (I may have issues with competitiveness). I refuse to go through that hell again so I won't ever have another (felt safe claiming that after the first 10 yrs, been over 20 now). "
"Change your routine, use some e-cigarettes with low nicotine to help with the cravings and help with the habit of smoking. "
"Make it inconvenient to smoke. Throw away your cigarettes. Really really want one? Fine. But a pack. Smoke one or two. Throw the rest away. Keep doing that whenever you want one. Eventually it becomes if you want a cigarette, you have to spend $5-10 (depending on your location) and go out to the store just for a smoke or two. 
Eventually you’ll get a craving and thing “eh, not worth it.”"
"Make yourself sick. You think a hangover is bad? Trying having too many cigarettes. It's stronger than food aversion. The mere thought of a cigarette will make you sick. The smell on someone else, you've just vomited a little in your mouth.
I used to smoke a pack a day. Quit multiple times. Haven't touched a cigarette in 5 years. Even seeing a pack makes me queasy."
Just fucking do it!
"Cigarettes I had to try quitting multiple times. According to the high schoolers I worked with at the time, I was a bitch during. I felt like I needed to rip my tongue out. Finally went to Target and got a generic nicotine gum. No problems. 
Weed, was easier. My phone broke. I could not fix it. I had just moved and no one knew where I moved. I figured it was the best chance I'd have to quit. Still haven't gone back. A year later, I have a government job. Semi worth it."
"The only thing that helped me quit was running. Every time I craved a cigarette I would go for a run, even if it was 2am. It actually worked- it made me feel great knowing my lungs were getting back on track, and it ran out all of that extra anxious energy. "
"It will probably take more then one try and that nicotine patches tend to work the best. Also depending on where you live, some universities will give them out for free in exchange for you answering some questions. "
"your first 3 days to one week are going to be tough on your body. The remaining years of your life are going to be tough on your mind. Cold turkey is the easy way out but be ready for the mess: insomnia, anxiety, mood swings... YMMV. Try to compensate with exercising.
2 years later and I still feel the urge to smoke. The key here is that you become aware that the feeling will go away in very few minutes till the next urge. Wait it out and with time, the time between urges will expand. 
You have to want to quit. This is the most important part. If you're not convinced or doing it for someone, then you won't have the will to see it through. Again, this is a very hard fight and a very internal one, both mentally and physically. "
I read this as “ex-workers”. The comments really confused me. I’m high. 
If your friends smoke then change your friend group.  It's hard to stop doing something when it's always around you.  Worked for me.
Just quit.
When you want to smoke.... Don't 
"I've quit multiple times, the longest span was 12 years.  I smoked my last cigarette on Dec 31st, 2011; 10 months later I won the cancer lottery: tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. The treatment, chemo and radiation, was a bear.  I won't be firing up again this lifetime.
Go cold turkey.  Fight the cravings; they get further and further apart. Good luck."
"Different smokes for different folks.
I tried cutting down a time or two. That never worked for me - I’d always creep back up to a couple of packs per day. 
Finally I’d had enough - mostly it was the smell, I think. I went cold turkey. First it was “I can make it an hour”. Then it was two. Then it was make it to lunch, end of the work day, etc. 
What may have helped was that it was not the only big change - I’d just gotten promoted to the next level of help desk cubicle dweller, and as part of that was hired on permanently (had been a contractor temp). Different group, different boss, different part of the building.
I theorized that if I could make it through the stress of all that without bailing out of quitting, then I could survive just about anything without starting again.
Theory was correct, I think. I’ve quit my job, moved states, started a business, gained a family, raised two kids to adultishhood, and haven’t smoked since the day I decided I’d had enough, 16 1/2 years ago.
"
"I started vaping, while I only traded one habit for another I do feel a lot better and my breathing is better after 5 years."
"I don't know if this will help at all, but when I quit it was entirely by accident. I had a wisdom tooth that needed to come out immediately. After the surgery, I wasn't allowed to smoke for a week, which is coincidentally how long it takes to break the chemical habit. So ... I guess ask your dentist if you need any surgeries your insurance will cover?"
"This may never be seen, but what worked for me was drinking ice water through a straw.  I also re-finished a dining room set at night so my hands were always covered in gloves and messy paint goop.  That kept me from wanting me hands anywhere near my face.
&#x200B;"
"Quit with someone. My wife and I quit together so we had a support system. Also, after a few days I could start smelling things again and that was amazing. Then I smelled the smoke on someone who just put a cigarette out. I couldn't believe how harsh of a smell it was to me. That also helped me a lot. "
"I started smoking e-cigarettes with really high nicotine content. 12mg I think. Then I started buy e-juices with lower nicotine content. Now I still smoke the e-cigarettes but with no nicotine. I like the flavour and the feeling of smoke (really Vapour) coming out of my mouth, but I am definitely not physically addicted to nicotine anymore."
"Quit buying cigarettes, quit smoking cigarettes, quit going places where you used to smoke, quit hanging out with people you smoke with, etc."
"Exercise and stay clear from other smokers, at least for the first couple of weeks."
I quit cigarettes and moved to dip. How do you quit dipping now.
"There are a lot of cues that trigger a person to reach for a cigarette. Those need to be replaced with something, or at least shaken up a little. Waking up, eating, getting in a car, these are things that are going to remind you of smoking. Try to associate something else with these cues.
Try forcing yourself to wait a minimum period of time between each smoke, and gradually increase that time until you’re only smoking one a day, then stop.
Most of all, want to quit. Accept infrequent moments of weakness. Never give up entirely."
"Whenever I wanted a cigarette, I ate a pepperoncini and took a walk. Whenever I wanted to eat everything in sight, I ate pickles. Both are low calorie, so absolute minimal weight gain, which kept the incentive up. Jumping jacks through cravings, run up and down a flight of stairs through cravings. Then take a nice long walk, breathing deeply. And more pickles and peppers, as needed."
"Be honest, but also don't put too much pressure on yourself, too many people I know who have tried to quit put too much pressure on themselves to quit that they cracked, smoked, considered themselves a failure, and kept smoking.
I started smoking a little bit before my 18th birthday, and I quit about 2 or 3 years ago, I smoked a pack a day or more, and I have pretty bad asthma, I was more overweight than I am now and had/have sleep apnea, every night I would stop breathing in my sleep and wake up choking for air, and desperately looking for my inhaler with my throat and chest burning, and if I was lucky that would happen only once a night. And after using my inhaler I would go outside or open my bedroom window and light up a smoke.
My dad smoked 3-4 packs a day from the time he was 18 until the same time I quit (he actually quit a little while before I did), and growing up I watched him cough until he passed out more times than I can count, I would watch him get winded picking up something on the floor, and I saw how it affected myself as a child, my mother, my sister and saw the pattern of every dog we owned getting cancer.
Both he and I tried to quit so many times and failed, mine was always giving in when the cravings hit or putting too much pressure on myself, and his was always buying a pack when he got cranky (or my mom would because she got tired of him being bitchy)
But when he quit it showed me I could do it, he _wanted_ to quit, whereas I really didn't want to quit so much as just stop being sick all the time.
He used a vape, patches and gum all at once, I on the other hand used just gum and the old ""one day at a time"" saying as well as the old adage about exercise and just doing it every day, I told myself the first day that I only had to make it through that day, and I said the same the next, and the next.
I also posted on Facebook about how smoking made me feel, how it made me look, how it affected my friendships and clothing, affected my family, etc. And anytime I felt like smoking I could look at it and see my own words, my own promise to myself.
I also told my friends and family I was serious and I would need their support, and even my friends who smoked would refrain around me and encourage me.
And I made it, I am sick less often, my inhalers last much longer, I have lost weight, quit drinking so much soda, eat less, and am happier.
Now that's not to say I haven't faltered or been tempted, I work with mostly smokers, both my bosses smoke and I go outside with them when they smoke, and I am tempted everyday to bum one, but I just remember all the things it did to me, all the people and pets I watched die from cancer, how many of my family members have died from cancer, and how it would set me back from all the progress I have made, and I think about the one time I _did_ cave and have a smoke, when I decided I would prove to myself I didn't want them and I felt like shit immediately after lighting it, and hated the taste but made myself finish it, my lungs felt like shit after, my mouth tasted like shit, my water tasted like shit, food tasted like shit, and I didn't brush my teeth before bed so I got to taste the shittiness the next morning, and I had a small coughing fit when I woke up, I hated myself and swore I wouldn't do it again.
I did the same thing with dip, since I quit that at the same time, when I caved to the craving and it gave me a stomach ache and made me nauseous for the next hour or so, and whenever I get the craving for dip I think of that, same as smoking. 
TL;DR
Be honest, be fair, realize you're only in competition with yourself, you set the rules, and you're basically just trying to go one day at a time trying to beat your high score, and if you falter, just get back on the train. Hold yourself accountable and it may help to ask others to hold you accountable, you can do it. "
I bought a vape and moved to a state I can't afford cigarettes.  Slowly reduce dosage of nicotine. 
"It’s actually really fucking easy, just quit after 15-16 years or so. The first few days is tricky and all you do is chew nicorette for like 2-3 days and then you can go without. The cravings disappear really quickly if you let them."
"Everytime I wanted a cigarette, I would suck on two peppermint Altoids and it would stop the cravings."
"Keep trying and trying until you hate it. That’s what I did. Quit in 2013. I had a few puffs here and there for the first two years and then finally it disgusted me so much I don’t go near it at all anymore. Hate the smell, hate everything about it. You can do it OP!"
"This is kinda long, but there’s no TL;DR.
I used to smoke... a lot. Like 3 packs of Export A Green King (known as “green death”) a day. Yeah. A day. I loved smoking. I would chain smoke. I would wake up in the middle of the night for a smoke. I had that “smokers squint” from constantly having a dart in my mouth.
I started waking up coughing... for like, half an hour. Eventually, that coughing produced deep red, bloody phlegm. I got worried. I went to the doctor, and he told me I had early onset emphysema.
I was 24.
I asked him if he had any advice on quitting. I was ADDICTED. I couldn’t quit in my own, I didn’t have the will power. I’d tried.
He suggested Champix (Chantix in the US, a brand of varenicline), and I took the advice. Except I could afford the medication. 
As it happened, my family was attempting to quit smoking. After my mom quit, she still had a few weeks left of the several month program, and offered them to me. I took them, adjusted the dosage (later weeks have a higher dosage than earlier weeks), and gave it my best shot.
I took into consideration advice from my family, and my doctor, and made myself a simple rule. After the first 2 days, any time I wanted a smoke, I waited 5 minutes. That was in the way of “I’ll finish this chapter, then I can go for a smoke.” Or “I’ll reach the checkpoint, then I’ll go for a smoke”.
At first, it was hard to put a smoke off even that long. But by the end of the week, I’d put it off for 5, and the forget for 30. The end of the next week, that 5 minutes turned into 3 or 4 hours.
Once I went a full day, I gave my roommate the rest of my carton, and I quit. 3 weeks into the course, I went from 3 packs a day to nothing, and it took almost no effort.
So my advice? TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR! Quitting is hard, and if you can’t do it on your own, there’s options and assistance you can lean on it. And you only have to do this once. Everyone says you fight it the rest of your life, and it’s true, to an extent, but it’s just once in a while you think “I could use a smoke... fuck it, not worth it”. The cravings you start with dissipate, I promise. I’ve been quit 9 years, and I only think about missing smoking once every couple months, for like, 30 seconds.
And as much as I do occasionally miss smoking, I enjoy not coughing up blood. I enjoy not having to use oxygen. I enjoy being able to exercise and not damn near die. And I enjoy the extra $1500/month (that’s what my habit would cost now).
Good luck."
"Getting pregnant worked for me. 
But seriously, even that came down to wanting to quit/quitting cold turkey, no excuses. I tried picking it up again after I had my son, and I hated it (thankfully). Husband quit when I did, but he vapes now. "
"Can someone give me the motivation to quit vaping? Is it impacting my health? I understand you aren’t supposed to vape unless it was to help get off the cigs. But I’ve picked up vaping as a hobby in the last year and I’m 21. The only real reason I would see for me to quit would be a health risk, and I look things up saying that vaping is like 90% healthier etc. So, with that said I never smoked cigarettes in the past, I just vaped. Am I actually putting myself in danger of life shortening, disease and things of that nature? "
"Not really. I mean, be careful of overdoing it, inhaling water vapor into ones lungs CAN lead to various issues such as pneumonia. But generally speaking it’s harmless. Yes, it’s nicotine, so it IS an addiction, and a pretty nasty one at that (in terms of ease to quit) but as long as you’re comfortable with the concept of HAVING an addiction, vaping is more or less harmless. "
"The most accurate “anti-smoking” ad I’ve seen was from one saying - don’t give up on giving up. Every cigarette you don’t smoke is one step closer to quitting. As long as you WANT to quit and you’re actively doing things to help you quit, you will get there!"
"There are two ways you can view yourself:
A smoker who's trying to quit
Or
Somebody who used to smoke
It's just a perspective switch, but one of those people has a hell of a lot more power than the other. Try it."
"Get pregnant.
"
I used to do that. Doesn't work anymore since I can't get knocked up lol
Just rip the bandaid off and go cold turkey. Do it when you don’t have to focus on anything important for a few days. Instead of taking drags take drinks. Good luck. 🤙🏼
"I started having constant issues with acid reflux which really interfered with my life. So I went on a strict diet and quit smoking cold turkey, was easy in that situation.
I don't think I would've quit otherwise, I didn't really want to before the health stuff. I think it's important to want to quit in order to do so successfully.
A few years later when I was on the verge of divorce I picked it up again. But I quit again (for good, it seems) after I started going out with my current SO. He didn't mind the smoke and said it was up to me if I ever quit, but that he would like if I did at some point. He said he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and would hate if some of our years together would be taken away by smoking induced health problems. That resonated with me a lot better than my ex husband who tried to tell me 'I had to quit'."
Pregnancy. It's been three years. 
Just fucking do it and stop giving yourself excuses 
"This doesn’t work for everyone, but I smoked for about 15 years. One day I stopped buying cigarettes. I’d tap the odd one from mates when I was in the pub, after a few months I wasn’t bothered anymore and haven’t smoked I cigarette in over 10 years. I did have a few spliffs in Canada a few months back, but that’s doesn’t count right?  Bloody amazing it was too👍"
Switch to vaping. Break the rituals surrounding the smoking habit with vaping but then ween off the nicotine with the vaping before developing new rituals around vaping. If you relapse switch to vaping again ASAP. Repeat as needed. 
Stay away from smokers for a few months.  it will help a lot.
I replaced it with magic the gathering. Now I’m homeless.
Get pregnant! Worked like a charm for me. 
know your triggers and avoid them
Find an important reason to quit.
"I ripped it off like a bandaid. I said to myself that if I didn't do it then, I would die. And I never did it again aside from an occasional handful of times here and there."
"This isn't about quitting nicotine but instead quitting weed smoke. I found that going to edibles allowed me to quit smoking and noticed I didn't have the same cravings with edibles, which made it easier to quit weed altogether."
"Probably it will be buried but an honest question deserves an honest answer. I set myself a date, my 30th birthday which was some months away and then continued smoking guilt-free while subconsciously anticipating that day, to the point that I was looking forward to it. Come my birthday I stopped cold turkey after 14 years a smoker and it was easy. I psyched myself.
 I would love to say I never looked back (over ten years now) but the times I have smoked since have only ever been on an evening, or for a week or two, the longest time being 2 months. The difference from all my failed attempts at giving up previously is that I no longer think of myself as a smoker. It’s a strange thing the mind."
"Just stop smoking. Job done.
That's all I did. Just stopped and got on with life and stopped thinking about it."
I went to vaping honestly. I still smoke when I'm at drills usually but not at home. Idk if that really counts but that's basically how I stopped smoking regularly.
Stop buying cigarettes. 
"I tried everything for years. Patches, the pills, the mint things and vaping.
Eventually I got so mad with myself I bought another vape with 12mg, 6mg, 3mg and 0mg nicotine juices and just had to will power my way through it.
I was so sick of failing and going back to the cigarettes I think I’d just made myself so worked up I just stuck with it.
I vaped for about 3 months and figured every time I bought cigarettes was at the petrol station and grocery store so before I walked in I would just pump the hell outta the vape. 
I could control the urges enough not to buy cigarettes so I never had any to smoke. I just worked my way down on the nicotine in the juices and eventually was just vaping 0mg juice.
Then I would hide the vape out of sight so I wouldn’t see it and want to vape. Couple weeks of that I’d given up the vape and now I don’t even know where the damn thing is."
I gradually cut down to the point I was only smoking maybe 3 or even less daily. I still kept the pack of cigarettes with me as it was my safety blanket. There were days I didn’t smoke at all but knowing I had the cigarettes made me feel better. Going cold turkey from there was way easier. I also avoided drinking for the first couple months (cigarettes and alcohol you know). I also stopped hanging out with friends who smoked until I felt I was in a stronger place mentally. It’s been almost 5 years and now I’m completely free. I have no desire to smoke whatsoever. I should mention I was smoking for almost 15 years. 
"The main thing  that helped is that I addressed my mental health. When I cured my anxiety more or less, I didn't feel the need to calm myself with cigarettes anymore. "
"Do not wait until the next big event or life change is over before you quit. 
A change in your routine is the absolute best thing for helping to avoid the smoking routines you have built up. It forces you to go out of your way to smoke, instead of always having your morning cig with a coffee then another during your work break etc. 
So if you're going on vacation, changing jobs, moving house, or just getting through the holidays with extra people around, don't think ""I will quit when this is over""; quit NOW. It's honestly the best time. "
"I got 2 of my coworkers off cancer sticks with vaping, one is going on 7 months and the other is at 3 months but both of them wanted to give up cigs so i just pushed them into a better direction"
"Not quite an ex-smoker but maybe someday. As many have said, you have to actually want to quit. My problem is if I have a moment of weakness and buy a pack I will smoke them all. I do want to quit but there are times I would still enjoy one such as having a Scotch after a long day or maybe with my coffee on the one morning I don't have to rush out the door. So I keep a couple cigars around, the cost is a dollar and a few drags gets me past buying cigarettes.  Worse case if I go thru a couple cigars a day it was still better than 1 or 2 packs of cigarettes. "
Bupropion 
"Haven't had a cig since July. Was a pack and a half a day smoker. I switched to a vape. With mod style, not the blu/jewel kind. 
You have got to make it past the first two week hump. Its easier after the first week. Way easier after the 2nd. I was smoking red 100's and there is obviously more than just nicotine in those that I was addicted to. But the vape helps.
Best tip I got was from the guy at the shop I got the vape from. I told him I was quitting cigs and to give me the strongest vape juice he had and he said not to go high. Start at a 6 or 8 nicotine at highest, because if you hit it over and over trying to make up for ciggs, you can make yourself sick. Like slapping on 4 patches at once. 
I started with 6 and every time I went to get more I would buy a bottle of the same and the next one down. Slowly weaning down. Finally bought a 1 and a zero and had been mixing them to a higher ratio of zero. 
Now I've been vaping the zero for a couple days and I haven't felt like killing anyone. Debating on giving it to a friend to help him quit when I think I'm done with it, or keeping it in case I get tempted if I get drunk.
Also be careful of the things that trigger you really wanting a smoke. Eating, drinking, sex, stress, etc. Especially in those first two weeks. Eating but never till the point I felt full helped. 
Also my partner has mentioned that it's far better to smell like cookies than cigarettes, which I have empathy for now that I'm starting to get a sense of smell back. "
"nicotine gum, quit for *a little over a year and
I smoked for 30 years and that shit gets ingrained a bit. I think about how good food tastes and how bad smoking stinks. When I get in the elevator with someone that smokes I can smell it. I don’t judge, I smoked for a long time but I’m glad I can tell the difference at least. Quitting sort of makes you feel a little more clean. Its actually really fucking awesome. If you slip up, get back on it. I’ve quit for months even a little over a year before at a time, I’m hoping this one sticks because it’s been *a little more than a little more than a year this time and I’m doin good. Whatever ya do, don’t give up. Get good at quitting. "
"Change your routine. Wake up a little later, pick up a new hobby, see if you can change your hours a bit at work, pick up some overtime or take a short vacation. For me, quitting only works if I make myself so busy I don't have time to smoke, or switch up my schedule so I forget to smoke because it's no longer part of my routine. "
" For me I was dumb and smoked way too young, for way too long, during way too many health issues, so coughing up blood was what pretty much did it, damage is done and I'll probably get the worst of it in a few more years.
A lot of it is just keeping busy. Find something to chew, something to fidget with, avoid stress where possible. 
If all else fails, do some math and realize how much money you're freeing up."
"I smoked a pack a day for a long time and these are the tips I can give for quitting.
1. Try to hang out with people who smoke less at least for the first couple months.
2. I got a vape started at a high dose of nicotine and moved down 2% every time I ran out of juice until I reached 0%. Once I was at 0% I used my vape for a little longer but then realized I wasn’t gaining anything from smoking it and put it down and never picked it up again. 
Hope this helps someone quit! It’s been four years and I haven’t looked back "
"Just do it. You can use aids, but at the end of the day if you don't have the willpower to quit cold turkey like I did you're more likely to be like my mom who has quit at least 10 times in my 32 years alive through this or that method. It's hard, incredibly hard, but it's so worth it."
"Focus on the taste it gives in your mouth it’s disgusting, also after only a couple days your mouth already feels much fresher assuming you take proper care of it. Focus on that aspect it helps a lot"
Visit /r/stopsmoking is the best tip :)
My mom smoked for 30 years. She quit cold turkey by eating a LOT of licorice. 
Cocaine
I picked up a pack of cigars and smoked that when urges got bad.
I found the hardest thing to give up was my morning cigarette. I completely changed my morning routine to avoid having the opportunity to have a cigarette which worked for me. 
Easy Way to Stop Smoking from Allen Carr. Highly recommended
"Make sure you're quitting for your own reasons. I tried to quit so many times for someone else, and it never worked. One day i just woke up and decided I didn't want to smoke anymore. Haven't had one since, it's been about two and a half years. 
I also limited myself to how many smokers I hang around. If a friend of mine smoked, I'd avoid being around them while they were smoking. I'm fine being around it now, other than the fact that I hate the smell. 
Willpower is the most important thing. Just keep reminding yourself why you want to quit. Remind yourself you're doing a good thing. 
(I ended up gaining over 30 pounds when I quit so try to keep your eating and exercise habits the same when you quit, otherwise you might end up like me. But remember gaining weight is almost inevitable and that's okay.)"
Track the cost - only way I found worked for me. 
Vape. Now I barely even use the vape. Smoked over 20 years a pack a day at least. Also before quitting I forced myself to buy shitty brands of cigs. They were gross. It helped to vape more smoke less. Haven’t smoked In a year and a half
"Get really sick and nearly die. I’m on my 11th day in the hospital. Started off with kidney stones, then an e. Coli infection, then sepsis. I woke up twice in ICU. Seeing my daughters that scared has convinced me that I don’t need it. I was healthy 34 year old women by the way. "
"This is probavly too late for anyone toi notuce, but I quit cold turkey after simply realizing that I dont need a cigarete. Itt gives you nothing other than relief from the very mild abstinence you are feeling which will dissapear after less than two weeks."
Don't be around people the first day. They're more likely to annoy you and make you light up a cigarette when you're on edge like that.
"I switched to nicotine gum and was on that for a couple of years.  Then something happened where I couldn't have any gum for a week.  Once I went through those withdrawals, I decided to quit.  And compared to cigarettes, it really wasn't as hard.  Haven't smoked for about 8 years now and I don't miss it at all.  Helps that I don't hang around anyone who smokes anymore either."
Ask your doctor about chantix
"I'm not an ex smoker, but there are certain periods where you're most likely to relapse. I got this information for my dad, but if u try quitting and suddenly got an urge years later, it's part of the fact. Try to stay strong, and don't give up even if u relapse. Smoking a few doesn't mean u have to go back to smoking daily, so forgive yourself an keep trying even if u lose the battle at times. "
"Ween yourself and be willing to avoid activities that make you want to smoke
Count out how many cigarettes you average a day.
The first month, cut that number in half
The next month, cut that new number in half.
If that’s too drastic a change, cut in 1/3’s and add on extra months to the weening
And don’t be upset if you backslide a bit because of stress or the ritual of it.  If you are on 10 smokes a day down from 20...and one day you have 14 instead of 10.  Its ok.  Shit happens.
Just get right back on the horse.  One day doesn’t erase your progress
By weening yourself...you are giving the body a chance to adjust. 
Sure...you’ll feel like dammit the more you ween off, but you’ll feel infinitely worse if you just do a hard stop.  And if you need more than a month at each level...take it
The result is the important thing, not how you get there
And as for avoiding smoking situations...it sucks but stay out of bars til you get the cravings under control.  
When your friends take a smoke break at work, do something else like walk a lap around the building or go sit in your car and listen to your fav music really loud.
If your employer is strict about breaks but allows smoke breaks...talk to them.  Tell them you are trying to quit and are using smoke breaks times to get your mind off the craving
Just make sure you are getting your work done so they dont think you are just goofing off
Strong ass mouthwash helps too.  If certain foods make you crave a smoke, like coffee.  Take a big ol swig and swish for 30-60 seconds.
It’ll help with the taste related cravings
It’s a process folks
You need a plan.  You need a schedule.  And you need self motivation
You have to *want* to quit for yourself.  Otherwise you’ll end up backsliding
"
"A little lalate for this. You have to do it all at once. Dont do it gradually, its harder. Try to quit in one hit, and deal with the anxiety it brings. First three days are the worst. Dont drink for a month either, or temptation will overcpme."
"I've been smoke free for roughly a year now. Best advice is just stop. Stop right now. None of this ""when this pack is done"" or ""the work week is so stressful i'll stop on the weekend"" etc. Also mo cutting down to 4 a day or whatever. It won't last. You'll be saying ""oh well 5 a day is only 1 more than 4."" Next thing you've smoked 10 and the next day youre smoking what you were before. Just quit completely right fucking now. I also have no personal experience with quitting aids like the patch. Maybe they work maybe they don't. I know i have an addictive personality and i quit cold turkey one day without hesitation. It really sucked for less than a week and then got much better. Now i've been over it for months"
"This is going to sound kind of stupid, but if you can create obstacles which obstruct whatever your usual method of acquiring cigarettes is (and any rituals associated with smoking), you probably have a better chance of quitting than by trying to consciously kill the habit.
For example, I tried quitting by ramping down my cigarette consumption (literal forced rationing) once I got to about 6-8 cigarettes a day. It worked for a couple of months at a time but eventually I was always back at previous consumption levels after dealing with any particularly stressful (mostly work, sometimes social) event. It just didn't work.
Over time I began to gravitate towards a particular brand and type of cigarettes (thin menthols). Not every vendor in my city had them, so I ended up eventually always buying from one particular guy near my apartment. I developed a rapport with the guy. Eventually, I had to move to a new city, where it so happened that no one super close to my new place sold them. Sure, I could still get them, but it was a 20 minute walk, not a shop right next to my building, and anyway, I didn't know anyone, so I couldn't smoke/chat with the dude I was buying cigarettes from.
I tried other brands that the nearest cigarette shop sold but they just didn't scratch the itch in the same way. And just like that I ended up quitting because the usual ritual of acquiring them got interrupted.
Now hopefully you don't have to actually move to another city, but anything you can do to make the ritual a little inconvenient will help you a lot."
Not smoking helps 
Vape
"Vaping, now I just gotta quit this instead. But at least I can run 10k now."
"It's hard.  Get a good motivation.   Mine was when a friend got cancer and had his larynx removed.  He had one of those buzz-boxes that he put over a hole in his throat in order to talk.
Once you stop, remember that it is the first smoke that gets you hooked again.  That does not seem intuitive, but if you never take the first one, you never have to go through quitting again."
Vape helps a lot 
"I quit in 2011.  Lots of nicorette gum in the first week or two- got addicted to it and slowly weaned myself off it- heavily addicted to tea tree flavored toothpicks since :)
Tip:  Never, ever smoke again.  Just don’t."
Wellbutrin 
"I was a very heavy smoker (at least a pack a day) for 10 years. 
I decided I really wanted to quit so for a few days before I did, everytime I smoked I made myself really focus on it. With each inhale I took, I made myself picture the smoke go into my lungs, my brain ect. I would spend the whole 2 or 3 minutes of smoking that cigarette being very honest with myself about what I was actually doing. 
Then.. and this might sound like really bad advice.. I lied to myself..  a lot haha. 
When I would really want a smoke, I would say out loud something like ""man! I'm so glad I'm not smoking. I would hate to smoke right now.. so disgusting""
Or if someone asked me how I was getting on with quitting,i would tell them I was getting on fantastically and was not missing them at all (thank you for asking giant talking cigarette)
Also for the first month, I let myself eat whatever the hell I wanted. I deff put on a bit of weight but nothing irreversible (as it was only 4 weeks). "
"If you are badly addicted and really struggle to give up, your doctor can prescribe Valium (diazepam). It is very effective to get over the first couple of weeks of cravings. You have to be careful you don’t end up addicted to diazepam instead."
Have the support of a significant other 
"I tried quitting a couple times before I actually did. I dont think this would work for everyone, but I went on a 2 week field exercise without access to a place to buy more cigarettes. Just flat out not having access was the only way i got over the physical, must have a smoke.
After that, the biggest help was simply NOT BUYING A PACK. 
Also, recognize that you may lapse, accept that its ok, and continue on.
It also really really helps if your friends help you out. ""hey can I get a smoke"" ""fuck off you are quitting""."
I basically quit i still have a device and i only use it to grab a buzz like once a day
You're  wasting money. Use the money to buy ps4 oe something  set a goal
"Try a vape, but try and get oils that contain a nicotine dosage under what your typical amount from a cigarette would be (depends if you're smoking reds or blues or how much you smoke) continue to drop down the amount of nicotine percentage through the coming months to the point where you're essentially just vaping oil. Occasionally you will feel the need to smoke a cigarette, but plow through it and continue using your vape in those times of aggressive cravings. Additionally, It's okay to have a smoke when you're out socializing (at a bar, drinking), because you probably will do it. 
&#x200B;
You will save so much extra money at the end of the month, your lungs won't feel half as bad."
"I have a buddy who smoked pretty much his whole life after 14 or so. We're in our mid 20's and he's tried to quit a few times.
He's actually doing a *really* good job this time, it's been about 6 months. He said after awhile the cravings do go away. Until that point, for him it was straight willpower. 
He also said much of why he continued to smoke was (beyond the physical addiction) his oral fixation/the physical habit, so he supplemented it with smoking weed. That may or may not be a good alternative for you depending on where you live, the legality in your area, what job you have or what jobs you'll want to have, etc. "
I did a lot of LSD-25. Quitting was not hard after acid made you feel the inside of your lungs and what you had done to them for 12 years. Even in the middle of the worst depressive episode of my life (bipolar) I dropped that shit and never looked back. From over a pack a day to nothing. Took about a week and it was already in the rear view mirror both physically and mentally. 
[deleted]
No it's not.
"Vaping helps. I’ve not had a cigarette since August of last year. 
I had tried, unsuccessfully, to quit with patches. Didn’t work: they were expensive, made my arm itch, and the lack of hand to mouth fixation made me more irritable than going without nicotine at all.
Vaping has completely satisfied the craving."
"As ridiculous as this may sound - meeting someone with Cystic Fibrosis was the final motivator for me. This person has lungs going to shit and it's not something they have a choice about - and here I was - doing it on purpose.
&#x200B;
Not worth it. It's been about 5.5 years now and it's the best decision I ever made, I never regret it - do I miss smoking sometimes? Sure but it's not nearly as difficult now. I did the patch, for the 6th or 7th time in my 13+ year history with smoking.. I did the patch for about a week and got tired of it so I took it off and just. stopped. It sucked, but I lived through it and here I am, 5.5 years later - breathing fine and able to donate all my organs. 
&#x200B;
Good luck! you CAN do it - it's all will power.. take it minute by minute if you have to - you CAN and you WILL do it!"
Very relatable. My ex with CF caused me to quit for over a year. ✊
Start dipping
"Have a good motivation to do so. 
It's only hard if you don't really want to stop. I quit from one day to the next when my then girlfriend said she doesn't like the smell. No withdrawal, and I was on 2 packs a day for years.
I think ""quitting smoking is so hard"" is propaganda spread by the tobacco industry, and/or the ""quit smoking"" self help and pharma industry (which may well be their side business)."
Yeah I'm gonna call bullshit on this. 
Best tip: Don't smoke
That’s actually a terrible tip for someone who’s already started. 
I tried with patches and gum but it didn't work until the time I went Cold Turkey. Now smoke free since like 2010 
"stop now completely and don't start again. in two weeks the cravings will be gone and you'll only want them for brief moments on rare occassion. you'll find you have more energy, easier breathing, are not always half sick with something. it's great to be rid of them.
"
"Exercise and diet.
Definitely finding a new hobby to take up time and keep you busy helped, for me it was focusing on exercise and getting into shape. I occasionally go sit outside like I did when I smoked."
"Go cold turkey. Don't ease out of it by smoking less and less as that will never work. 
Going out on patios for fresh air is no longer something you do.  Let's be honest, getting fresh air was always just an excuse to smoke."
Most important thing to do is stop smoking.
Dont smoke.
"Just decide that you'll never smoke again, and do it."
Snus
Go to a Sauna every day for three days. You will sweat out nicotine and make it easier to quit 
Be broke
Get a vape with high % nicotine juice.
"I really wish I could get my gf to stop smoking, I try to tell her about how much money she would save. And how bad it is for her health etc as someone who as asthma pretty bad I don’t want to be breathing that shit in every time we go for a ride or eat someplace that has outdoor seating. Shit instantly ruins my mood when she breaks out them nasty things. Hopefully I’ll break her from that habit though and soon. "
"Smoking gives you wrinkles really bad.  Smoker's mouth. Ick.  That's literally why I quit, because I was getting wrinkles."
"Maybe try to get her to switch to a vape? Not perfect, but it is something better than smoking. And if it's the tobacco flavor she misses, there are those flavors as well. As well as menthol, depending on what she smokes. If she were to go for a real one, not a pen, she could mix the two."
Juul
Your getting downvoted but that's how I quit after 15 years of smoking
Just don't put them in your mouth anymore.
"This will be a weird one. Hate yourself.
&#x200B;
I read a lot of comments saying ""want to quit"". False. I mean, sure you want to quit someday and you are waiting for the day that you do not want a cigarette that much so it's easy. No, you are an addict, you'll always want to smoke. That's where the ""hate"" is useful. Do not give you the pleasure of smoking, torture yourself by wanting to smoke so bad and not allowing that, you do not deserve that.
&#x200B;
Yes I know you'll give yourself a healthier life and that is self esteem yadda yadda. Until now that hasn't work, ""I'm gonna take care of my health"" wasn't enough for you, if love didn't work use hate.
&#x200B;
First week will be the worst. First month and you will still want to ""just one..."" NO. Make it a game, or a punish o what ever it gives you more energy. I started this method when i got very sick and i ran out of cigs, then a game of ""how more days can i tolerate?"", then i needed! but i was 6 days out, and applied that ""hate"" mode thinking that I'll always want to smoke and I would suffer the day i try to quit, make that day TODAY. Yes, today is the best day to suffer. "
"Browse the web for pics and videos of people dying of lung cancer.  They're out there. People don't realize how painful and disgusting that death is. Disturbing as fuck, but I forced myself to watch a lot of them. I cried a lot. But I never picked up a cigarette again. 5 years! "
Don't try it in the first instance!
Don't take up the habit in the first place.
"15 months quit after smoking for ~25 years. There's no looking back. Breathing is awesome.
and by the way 
http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/"
That's it! There IS a sub-reddit for everything!
"I quit nine years ago after 30 years of smoking. 
Food tastes better, my hair smells better, I can walk up the stairs without gasping for air, I have about $300 extra dollars each month, I don't have to have my suits cleaned every other day, I don't cough and gag every morning, I don't have holes in my clothes anymore, my car and my apartment don't stink. I could go on, but you get the point.
Stay strong, you'll make it.
And if you don't, just start over. **Don't beat yourself up over it.** You're doing one of the hardest things ever."
more non-smokers need to read this.  They think that it's as easy as switching your favorite brand of soda-pop.
"4 years ago for me and all of this is true.  Best decision I have ever made, hands down."

"Rather, your lifespan stopped *decreasing* as a result. Arguably you will not live as long as you could have by not smoking at all.
Also in most cases you're never really saving as much money as you are just spending it on *other* things."
"I gave up smoking 317 days ago and yesterday in the laundromat some cute bitch jumped into my lap and put her tongue in my mouth.  She then rolled onto the floor putting her legs into the air and beckoned me to run my fingers down her neck.
Now, if only human girls found me as attractive as that dog did... but, it's a start."
LOLWUT.
"I like petting my dog too, but I usually don't let it French kiss me"
I fucking LOVE cold turkey. Never gonna quit. 
Smoked cold turkey ftfw.

"If you give in now, then the last four days of hell was for nothing. Never tell yourself one won't hurt. One will hurt more than any other cigarette you've ever smoked."
"I quit cold turkey 22 days ago. Get over that first hump and you're golden.
I ran a mile today. I never thought I'd be able to do that ever again. Feels good man."
"Kudos! I'm doing the jogging thing too. Keep it up! It's a great motivator because you can feel your breathing improving! I'm five months without a cigarette, and three miles every other day."
"**If you've decided to quit you don't need encouragement.**
My humble story:
- quit after smoking for 20+ years;
- first three days were difficult;
- after that, it went downhill: it's not physical anymore, but psychological;
- am here after 6 months, still haven't touched a cigarette (or equivalent);
- have gained 5 kgs, but still want to smoke every day (multiple times).
You're in it for the long run. Your decision."
"Read the Alan Carr book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"".  Maybe that will help change your attitude about it."
"This is the most important choice of your entire life.
The smoking is literally killing you. You must stop. "
"My Dad used to smoke about 2 packs a day. He decided to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a diver. He had to quit smoking to do this. He quit cold turkey.
He now has his master divers license and has gone cave diving in Mexico, dove into abandoned missile silos, Eel wall in the Puget Sound. 
He quit smoking to realized a childhood dream."
"My father quit when I was younger, and I can say it definitely patched up relations between us.  You'd be amazed what not smelling like death will do for a strained relationship (and not making your asthmatic kid start coughing every time you scratched your itch)"
"saying NO! is fun, it feels good to be in control of your body and brain
now you eat for taste, take a break to rest and look at all the weak willed individuals unable to resist their addiction!
"
"I quit, cold turkey, 3.5 years ago. Now only my ass and pits stink."
"I smoked over two packs a day. I don't miss it in the least. I thought while I was quitting that it wasn't worth living the rest of my life always wanting a cigarette so I thought maybe I should just give up and smoke, but forced myself to make it through it, just to find out one time. ... and I found out that it's not like that at all. I have zero desire to smoke at all. What your head is doing to you right now is lying to you. It's all lies. The way it feels right now goes away after a while, and the good news is that you've made it past the hardest part. It's slowly getting better now. I actually started to feel somewhat less than medically insane by about day six or so. I was home free after about day 14 and never looked back. It's totally worth it. Hang in there!"
"You got this bud.  Don't give in.  The amount of money, let alone your health should be reason enough to think about all of this.  People will come to respect you more knowing that you don't smoke anymore (should caring about what people think of you really matter.)
Regardless, I quit, and it's one of the best decisions of my life.  Look back and remember how you ""used to be a smoker.""  You'll look back and be glad that you quit now as opposed to later."
"I'll do the next best thing and tell you how much my life sucks because I haven't even made it to day 4.
First off, I'm spending money on cigarettes.
Second, a few days ago an old friend who knew I had quit smoking saw me smoking.  He didn't say it but I knew that he knew I felt like I am a freaking failure.
Third, I get winded going up the steps to apartment.
Fourth,  I smell like cigarettes, and that is not a good scent. 
Fifth, I'm slowly killing myself with nicotine, tar, and all of the yuck carcinogens that come along with smoking those deliciously lethal cancer sticks."
"Read the Alan Carr book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking""."
"Every day you wake up, that's the healthiest you've been since you quit smoking."
"I've got a different side for you to think of it from, buddy.
I aint quitting. I tend to feel like shit."
"I am 8 years quit after 7 years smoking... it is worth it so hang in there!  Don't be fooled, it is always difficult, but your mind is stronger than that."
Dude I quit two years ago. I was going to say some motivational things but these people got it covered. Do something to take your mind off the urge and keep it up. Put all that saved money in a jar and buy yourself a vacation next summer. That sounds a lot better than a dizzy head and an upset stomach which is the only thing you will get if you break down.
"I went hiking in Colorado for only a couple hours but I wasn't winded. My friends who smoked nearly died on the mountain, figuratively speaking."
"Used to be a pack-a-day, quit cold turkey just over a year ago (June 15th, 2009). 
Since quitting, I have:
* an additional $150 a month ($5 pack x 30 days), which means I've saved ~$2000 since I quit
* the ability to go up a single flight of stairs without being winded
* clothes that no longer reek of smoke
* a balcony no longer covered in ash and butts
* my sense of smell back
* a less ridiculous coffee addiction (smokers process caffeine at almost twice the rate of non-smokers)
* all of [these health benefits](http://blisstree.com/files/2007/06/smoking_timeline_2070x1530.gif)"
"alan carr's - easy way to stop smoking did it for me.
basically, you have to remember that cigarettes are in fact not pleasant to have, and that if you looked at your situation, from a rationally thinking (non nicotine addiccted person) you are so better of.  and also, apparently  after three days there is but trace amount of nicotine in your system, so now it is all mental."
"Quit 11 months ago after 8 years of smoking. I took up exercise and lost 40 pounds - for the first time in my life I am not obese, I have been very overweight literally as long as I can remember. I am now working on building some muscle and then cutting down to a BMI in the normal range.
The real benefits of quitting smoking started kicking in about 3 months after quitting - aerobic exercise became much easier at that point.
I don't remember _ever_ feeling this good."
"I can smell things. Things usually smell bad. And most people smell worse.   
Breathing is nice though. "
"I just want to let you know I'm proud of you.
I quit three months ago, and its hard.
Just take it one day at a time man"
"I'm a little over a month **free** from nicotine. I used nicorette when I got to that point of ""losing momentum."" 
When you stop smoking for good, it's like an inside joke that the smokers don't get. Every time you see someone smoking, you get why they smoke, but *you* don't need nicotine anymore - not like those fuckers do. You're better than that. 
You don't need a nervous crutch. Don't need to be embarrassed trying to sneak out. You don't need to hide the stench from that girl you've been talking to. When you're stressed, you work out - and you feel fucking great after. 
Successfully giving up smoking feels like swimming across a lake. And when you reach the other side - you turn around and see that dock filled with cigarette butts burning down and taking all the other smokers with it - while you're safe, happy, and healthy on the other side. 
That's the only way I can explain it. It's just, so worth it."
Allan Carr has got the answers
Yeah I agree his book really helps with the psychological side of things.
"Quit a few years ago.
I get much bigger rips off the bong now."
"  AFter I quit I decided to smoke a cig on my birthday.  I felt like a piece of shit and almost puked I got so sick.
  I am pretty confident I will never smoke another."
"No way to really know what your life will be like without smoking until you quit.  Try quitting for a while a see if you like it.  
Speaking from personal experience though, quitting is very refreshing."
"I smoked a pack a day of Camel Filters from about age 15-20. I quit cold turkey after two or three attempts. I got me some of those Tea Tree flavored chewing toothpick things. They really help deal with the oral fixation as well as give you something to grit your teeth on during cravings. When you quit you feel so much more healthy. You get your senses of smell and taste back. You don't get winded going up a flight of stairs. You will save a ton of money. It's a liberating feeling to not NEED a cigarette after a meal or when you wake up or when you have a drink. Stick with it man, you will thank yourself. "
"Good luck dude, 4 days is a fucking long way to come, don't look back!  I'm trying to quit myself right now and I must say that lozenges and patches and a really horrible flu helped me for the first part.  
Now whenever I need to remind myself of why i'm quitting I think of the thousands of dollars more I'll have a year, the health problems I might be saving myself, and I don't want to look like one of those pruny middle-aged women, who are obviously smokers, as I age.  Truth be told I'm just too lazy to have to maintain an addiction.
Deciding 100% that I was going to quit no matter what has been an important mental step for me.  "
Being smoke free is awesome!
Exercise.  I got a punching bag and some bag gloves (cheaper than chantix and judging by the fact that it's been more than a year I think more effective).
"Dude, I'm on Day 5, cold turkey.
I agree, this bit sucks. But really, would you put yourself through this to go back?"
"Do you have any side effects from going cold turkey?  When I did that a few years ago, I got the shakes and nausea for a week...
Edit:  To help you keep up the good work here's some [reading material for you...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease)"
"I quit cold turkey four years ago and did not even throw away the packets while doing so (had them around in the car and drawers) -  don't make it about unavailability, just your willpower, it still amazes me I could pull it off. Teeth clean, no funky smell on clothes, house and car, no bad looks from people, no dependence (that's the greatest) you breathe better... enjoy being smoke-free. It really is wonderful quitting. And don't even think about giving it a go again, even if its not a whole cigarette, it is not worth it.  "
Food! It actually tastes like something!
I have been clean for almost a year now. And I feel so energetic I can't believe I smoked for so long just to become lethargic. Hold on for a few more days the cravings will fade believe me.
"I agree with all the benefits that others listed, definitely worth it.  I quit cold turkey over 3 years ago after smoking for over 12 years.What did it for me was this stupid poster I saw in my doctor's office...it gave these stats like the oxygen in your blood returns to that of a non-smoker after a week (or something like that, I don't know the exact numbers) and your lungs return to that of a non-smoker after so many months and so on.  So every time I thought of giving into the cravings, especially in those first couple weeks, I thought about how I'd have to start quitting all over again and start the repairs to my body all over again. It seemed so tedious, and I never did give in. I know this is kind of long but I gotta say the worst part of quitting is the first week. If you can get thru that, you really can do it. Good luck!!"
"I'm on day two, so the nicotine is almost out of my body, but it really is the habit that is hard to break. My friend told me to jog on the spot really hard when you really want to smoke (obviously when you are alone or go to the bathroom or something). It wears you out a little, gives you a little endorphin rush et voila, forget about the smoking for a bit. "
"My breathing is healthy.  Food tastes better.  I don't smell like smoke.  I can say 'no' a cigarette. Cold turkey for 10 months, after 10 years."
"I'm on day 9 after smoking for 10 years. The mood swings and crankiness are horrendous. I can't wait for the cravings to go away but I know it's a long, long road."
"Read the Alan Carr book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking""."
"Congrats.  I couldn't tell you how life is better after truly quitting, since now and again I always just go cold turkey for a month or so, but it's a great thing you're doing anyway.  Having done this now a few times I will say you do feel better after you get over the initial hump, but that's never the true problem.  Here's what it boils down to:
It's easy to not smoke at any particular point in time.  It's easy to go one day without a cigarette.  It's massively more difficult to aggregate all those together and make yourself into a true non-smoker.  I've never had a huge amount of pain rejecting any one smoke.  It's about being the person who has better things to do than worry about smoking.  I would suggest starting an exercise habit once your lungs feel like they're recovering enough for some strenuous activity.  Go running, biking, hiking in beautiful places.  Enjoy the world.  It's right there for you to do that, and if you find that smoking makes it difficult to enjoy what was given to you, quitting will make sense to you in a way that has much more immediate ramifications than ""it will be a very messy and gruesome way to die one day that I can't really properly envision right now.""
Odd to hear this coming from someone who still is smoking, and certainly the guys who have quit for years now are much better authorities on the matter than I am, but if you find my small experience with going clean now and again helps you, I think it'll be worth it.  Hell, it'll be worth it just to leave it here when quitting time comes for me and I have words to remind myself of what quitting means. ;)
Good luck with what you're doing."

"I quit smoking in 1992. Much better health, food tastes better and all that. Also I bought a new Harley and a new boat with money that used to pay for smokes.
Keep strong, you can do it. And if you stumble, do not give up. When you learned to walk and fell you didn't give up and tell yourself you couldn't walk. If you have a cigarette now it doesn't mean you can't live without cigarettes, it only means you made a mistake. If you used to smoke a pack a day, having one cigarette does not mean you failed at quitting, it means you succeeded in saying no 19 times in one day.
Stay strong!"
"I have my 3 year anniversary in September and I am SO happy I quit. I smoked a pack a day for 15 years and I feel a zillion times better on my worst day as a non-smoker than I ever did on my best day as a smoker. Look forward to deeper breaths, a better sense of smell and taste, smelling way better to everyone around you, looking healthier. 
In the meantime, while you're quitting, give yourself a break. Do nice things for yourself and be easy on yourself if you have bitchy moments. Once you get past the hard part it's all downhill. 
I'm proud of you for even trying :) "
"I quite 11 weeks ago, went from 1-2 packs a day (for 21 years) to zero.  I've saved over $1000CAD so far (about $350/month) by no smoking 2300+ cigarettes.  In my life time I estimate I've smoked at least 160,000 cigarettes and spent around $40,000CAD.
Don't sweat it too much, do your best.  If you really want to quit you can, it's easier than you think.  If you stumble, just keep going, don't attach too much stress to it - it's like a catch-22 trap - you stress over smoking, which makes you want to smoke more.  Oh - avoid other smokers for a while if you can :)"
"I just gave up smoking 2 months ago, for which I had to quit alcohol and coffee. Have taken up tennis to help me out.
[This](http://blisstree.com/files/2007/06/smoking_timeline_2070x1530.gif) helped me alot!
"
"Two years without after 15 years with. I can breathe easily, am free from the occasional heart attack paranoia and don't get winded walking up stairs. In fact, I'm in the best shape of my life. My skin looks better and I don't smell bad. I have more disposable income, and don't divide my time by my cigarette breaks. And I have more time. Food tastes better. 
If you have a craving, wait it out. They only last five minutes on average. 
Remember, to have a smoke is a conscious choice, not something that just ""happens"" in a moment of weakness. Continue to choose not to. 
Don't have that first one. Its never just one, remember.
Best of luck and good vibes!"
"On year 5 here of quitting.  Quit when i realized I have been smoking half my life...and had a baby girl.  I feel amazing.  The cuffs are off.  Food tastes great.  I sleep better.  Sex is better.  I have soooo much energy and I'm saving tonnes of cash.  Just don't smoke.  Just keep telling yourself that. Just don't smoke...day after day.  The first 2 weeks are the worst.  After that it gets better. However you still get your 'triggers'...ie - drinking, a good meal, coffee...etc.  That will last a long time.  Im not sure how long for you but I can say it is worth it for yourself bro. Just hang in there and TRUST me you will look back at yourself and wonder WHY the hell you even smoked in the first place."
"It's not about me, but I don't like hugging my mom because she tends to smell bad. "
"On year 4, cold turkey, I just smile when I get the urge because I know that monkey is off my back.. "
I'm on day 4 as well.   Reddit solidarity!
"My brother is a college student and has saved over $300 since he came back from school for the summer. And $300 in college money is like $3000 real money.
He quit cold turkey as well. "
"Find a pool and go for a mile-long swim.  Or run a few miles.  If it hurts then you f'ing deserve it slave!  My swims and runs are what keeps me from starting back.  If I do backslide my body feels the damage so much I am compelled to stop.  Just go to bed if you get pissy.  Or get drunk, whatever...just don't smoke.  After 4-5 days the physical addiction is gone.  However, the mental addiction will never go away...but at least the mental addicition doesn't make you an a'hole the way the physical addiction does.  Take it out on your body by swimming/running and not out on anyone else."
"How great will it be when you see the smokers lurking around outside as pathetic victims, instead of as ""cool kids"" ?"
"My wife and I quit cold together nearly 20 years ago, after having smoked as long. Some things that helped:
Nicotine gum. Early on it helped to stifle cravings quickly so you could stop thinking about craving and focus on something else. After a week, we started cutting the gums in half, and a week later in quarters, and when I was thinking about cutting a nicorette into eighths, I figured, ok, I don't really need this any more.
An insight given us by a psychologist we consulted before Q-day: your body is dependent on you to protect it. Cultivate a feeling of responsibility toward your lungs, your arteries, which are completely dependent on you to protect them. Feel parental toward your own innards.
Understand what we called the ""tall grass"" thing. You have associated smoking with all sorts of situations and activities (e.g., opening a beer, pouring coffee, finishing a run...). Every time you do one of these activities, or enter one of these situations, the association is triggered and you think of smoking. But the association is weakened when you don't smoke. So you really have to go through all these life events multiple times, not smoking, to kill the associations. Some you hit often, so they die soon; others come up more rarely, so they surprise you. We likened it to camping in a hay-field: where you walked a lot the grass is quickly flattened, but then we'd stray into the tall grass, hit some still-active association."

"I've quit a few times I'm sorry to say. This time I'm going on 4 months. It really does get easier, and it's nice not being ostracized :) coming in out of the rain. Not smelling of smoke at the end of the day. Good luck!! Remember 1 day at a time. Do NOT think about forever, think about getting through today, worry about tomorrow tomorrow."
"6 years without a cigarrette, after having smoked for about 7-8 years. Cold turkey never worked for me; what finally did it was the Nicotrol inhaler. Two people I recommended it to actually went and got a prescription for it, and both were able to quit smoking, too.
It's a little weird, but it fucking *works*!"
"Why is that weird?  You're still taking in nicotine, so you haven't really quit all the way."
"I just quit cold turkey, i tried patches, and gum, and all the rest. 
Life is AWESOME you'll start coughing up all kinds of delightful things.
I got a vaporizer, and a 1/8th and stayed in for the long 4th of july weekend. Didn't really do much other than smoke bowls and hang out. that weekend. Also when i was around the house if i didn't want to smoke a bowl i'd do 25 situps when i had a nicotine craving, by time i was done with the situps the craving had passed, and i had done 25 situps. 
Also got an extra about 200-250 a month to blow, on what ever, or save. I'm looking at it like an airplane ticket a month. :-D enjoy your self. Dont try to quit, just stop buying them and finally quit."
Think about being able to take a full deep breath...one of the simplest pleasures in life you have since forgotten about.  You can do it!!!
"I can run a half marathon now, whereas before I couldn't run half a mile. It feels great. And, though I still have terrible urges to smoke not too infrequently, whenever I do succumb the cigarette tastes terrible. Absolutely horrible.
Unless I'm drunk... then it still tastes like a little slice of heaven.
But even that is changing.
The most important piece for me is to remember that if I fail and smoke a couple of cigarettes one drunken night, all is not lost. Temporary failure is just that, temporary. Never, never, never think that one weak moment ruined it all for you.
Good luck.
**EDIT** Oh, I smoked for 7 years, quit for 3 months, smoked again for 5, and have since not smoked a single cigarette in over 4 months."
"I quit fast food cold turkey, and now I'm 40 pounds lighter. Keep up the good work!!!"
"I haven't been able to quit so kudos to you. My close friend quit about three years ago and he says it's the hardest thing he's ever done, worse than really intense break-ups or grad school. My personal suggestion is smoke a whole pack in about a half an hour, or as fast as you can, and then you'll hate yourself so much that you'll never want to smoke again. Or at least that is my plan for when I quit.
Godspeed, dear."
"Read the Alan Carr book, ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking""."
I quit 4 weeks ago cold turkey after 10+ years of smoking. You keep at it. 
"Quit for just over 10 years.
For one thing, I wife would have never dated me if I was a smoker.
I bike to work, hike on weekends and am about to get my black belt in Aikido."
Smoking is bad mmkay.
"Much, much better. You own your lungs instead of giving them to tobacco shareholders."
"I quit cold turkey after smoking for the past 5 years 15 days ago.
Stay Strong"
"whenever you want to sit on the floor wrap your hands around your legs under your knees and roll around like a ball til the feeling passes and you realize how much more interesting your life can be coming up with new ways to not bother, you know it, when your around smokers is the true test, your eyes will zero in on it, ur friends will offer you, don't blame them, just go, i love aggravation, then maybe go outside and try the ball thing again."
WTF?
if you stay off them for another 4 days I'll doodle something for you. [here's some of my doodles](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/cri4m/offer_will_try_to_doodle_something_for_every/)
"Spiritually, smoking stunts you.  You cannot be fully in the moment when you are in the throws of an addiction.  You are not in control of your life, nicotine is."
"Just break the habit of where you normally smoke. If its while driving, or on a break at work, just try to take your mind off of whatever situation. Eat some candy, talk a walk, or while driving put on some music and chew some gum"
"Honestly, good luck man.  Day 4 is usually when I start dreaming of breaking peoples necks in that completely unrealistic way that Van Damme and Seagal do in their (horrid) movies.  Thank god peoples necks are actually really damn strong or quitting smoking would lead to huge swaths of destruction."
"I can take a full breath.  The day it happened that suddenly I could breath in about 10% more my lungs felt like they stretched that way for the first time in forever.  
I can regain my breath in a few minutes now instead of about 30 minutes of wheezing after just a few minutes of exercise.  
I can smell and taste things better.  
Fucking seems to go better.  Earlier to rise and I can do things I used ta couldn't do stamina-wise.  
"
"5 years clean, after a 20 year habit. Thing not many people mention is that you can still miss smoking even after that long quit - especially if you had it tied to something like having a coffee in the morning and relaxing, that really makes quitting it a bitch. Am I better? Dunno, but here smoking is banned almost anywhere where oxygen is present so at least I'm not one of those poor assholes out on the street in the rain on a saturday while everyone else is inside the club."

"Dunno if you like wine - if you do, book yourself on a wine tasting tour - you will be completely blown away by all the subtle tastes hidden away in this ordinary drink - as a smoker all these awesome tastes were hidden from you."
On the other hand:  consider the poor tobacco companies that your quitting is putting out of business.  Nobody thinks of the little guys any more!
your penis won't fall off like in the adverts.
"Do push-ups or go for a little jog when cravings hit.  Helps get the blood flowing. Make sure you have some buddies to help you quit go out for walks together when cravings hit, etc. "
"ridiculously so. it only gets easier, before you know it you'll be offended that someone else is smoking, and the world will have come full circle."
"I quit last september, after three years. My sex drive went through the roof, I'm a bajillion percent more confident, I'm stronger, I run farther, I have sex with hotter girls. And I'm able to have a lot more sex, because my stamina went through the roof. 
AND cigarette companies don't own my soul. I have a comma in my bank account. I feel elitism when I go back home to family and the house reeks. I am better than my tobacco-addled parents.
Quitting is the best feeling in the world. Its your trump card for when you feel down. Bomb an exam? Mess up a job interview? Creep out that cutie? WHATEVER. You're still the man because you have the strength to do what so many pussy-ass motherfucking smokers who 'want to quit but cant'. Fuck them, man, you're badass for getting even four days in.
Mad props to you for getting this far, you're over the biggest hurdles. This is a marathon now, training your body to realize that smoking isn't happening in the various situations you're used to.
You know that saying ""whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right?"" Well that is exactly the fucking case here."
"I've never smoked but my parents do. My Dad is 60 and my step mom is 58, she looks around 70, has no teeth in her head and has this cough that sounds like she's going to keel over dead any second. Quit smoking now or else you'll look 20 years older than you actually are and you're health problems will multiply with every second you keep smoking. You're on the right path, keep going!"
"An insight from those of us who don't smoke: smokers fucking stink, even when they're not currently smoking. Their clothes stink, their hair stinks, their breath stinks. Quite often I will make an excuse to get away from the stench of a nearby smoker.
You'll be starting to smell pretty good now. Keep it up!"
"I quit a few months back, but I only smoked for a few years. I miss it every day. I may start again, sweet delicious nicotine...."
"On August 8th it will 30 years since I have stopped.  The first couple of weeks are the hardest.  
take each urge to smoke one at a time and deal with them at the moment.
Things you have to look forward to are breathing easier and everything tasting better.  
Hang in there."
"In the last year of my PHD program I learned two things.
-Smoking is the main cause of lung cancer.
-Masturbation causes blindness.
Thank GOD, I stopped both, and pray every single day I will never do that again.

All there.
"
"I quit 3 weeks ago, allergies are terrible now for some reason, never had them before, and I feel like shit. 
Otherwise it's fucking miserable."
You should look into buying an e-cig. It's like having your cake and eating it too. Plus you can smoke inside and not stink. 
"Nah, it's got nicotine and even if you get the juice without nicotine it reinforces the habit."
"Never started.  It STINKS LITERALLY!!  How can you go back to stinky breath, yellow fingernails and nasty teeth?  
Plus, non smokers like me won't think you are yucky anymore if you stop! :P"
"Stay strong. Forget about the way the pack feels, how it gradually lightens as you pull a light, crisp cigarette to your lips. With a flick and a spark the cherry alights and you pull a soft, slow breath of smooth flavor deep into your lungs. How it warms you, how it soothes you, how it completes you. How no matter where you are or what's going on in your life it's always there for you. You can do it."
It's not better. Continue to smoke.

LIGHT UP MAN! IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO TURN BACK TO THE DARK SIDE!
ive been clean for 19 years now it feels good to have never started
"Had a friend who tried everything & kept going back. He got so fed up with himself he smoked half a pack, dumped the ashtray in a glass of water and drank it. Puked his guts up. Never smoked again. 
"
"""Raw Turkey"""
Kind of like how I loved tequila until I drank way too much and now just the thought of it makes my stomach turn and my butthole clench up 
That seems like a good method
Don't try this at home?
Jesus...
This is probably bad advice because nicotine is a potent poison at least somewhat comparable to the dosage of cyanide
That's actually incredibly smart... maybe he made it so that he had an actual aversion to it.
"It was difficult for me. I had smoked for about 15 years. I tried to quit twice and failed. Then, I was part of a small, family New Year Eve party. We stayed up all night drinking, smoking, and playing cards. The next morning, my mouth tasted and felt so nasty, I made a New Year resolution to quit. And I did.
My personal quirk was that I kept a pack of cigarettes in my pocket at all times. I knew that if I didn't have any, and a strong urge hit me and I went out and bought a pack, I would be smoking again. So, I essentially made it a war between me and the cigarettes, and I resolved to win that war. Will power. I did win."
"I kept an unopened pack in my purse for   the same reason. It helped!  *knowing* I could have one,  but chosing not to. "
That works if you stay busy right? When I'm at work I usually have nothing to do but smoke
"That's my plan, it's like resistance is better than denying myself because I'm actually winning something. If I just can't have one because there's none there then I'm just, I dunno, irritated, whereas if I can't have one and there is some there then it's my choice. Like I'm saying no rather than being told no, which I hate. "
Sounds just like how I quit. I was a smoker for 30 years. I quit 10 months ago - one day in particular I had smoked about 5 in a row. I was stressed about something. I felt sick and nauseated. I had to lie down. I haven't wanted one since. 
"Does using an ecigs count as cold turkey? If so, that's how I quit.
Furthermore, shortly after I quit my close friends also quit by switching to various ecigs. I used Blue Cig while they both used Juul. "
"Found a distraction to focus on. Ate peppermints or speariment (sp) Lifesavers and drank plenty of cold water simultaneously. When the urge to smoke hit, the combination of the peppermint/speariment and cold water gave my throat and lungs that mentholy feeling while breathing through my mouth that was somewhat similar to inhaling menthol cigarettes."
"This is what also worked for my friend too, except with mint-flavored gum. Chewing gave him something to do when he started feeling restless, and the icy-minty feeling from drinking cold water alongside helped to remind him not to smoke.
Also, when it got too bad, he would ask us to take him somewhere like the gym or whatever. Somewhere out and not in his car so he couldn't go pick up cigs.
"
"Be careful with lifesavers, the mint flavored have sorbitol as a sweetener. It's what they use in hospitals as a laxative. "
"I got a brain tumor!
No I'm serious lol. My tumor was located directly in the center of my brain
 So they had to separate my two frontal lobes in half and go straight into the center of my brain. All my addictions and drug tolerances were reset following that. It was quite interesting."
"Wow, that's fascinating.  Do you mind writing more about it?  I'm glad you are okay!"
"Just have a strong willpower and decide THIS is the day you quit! Don't wait until your pack is empty, break your cigarettes in half and throw them in the garbage. Then after 12 hours, buy a new pack and think about your life and how you're such a sad fucking screwup "
"I read your first sentence and rolled my eyes. But yeah, very accurate portrayal. "
In my experience it is easier to stop smoking at the start of a new day.
"I quit smoking cold turkey when I became pescatarian, I only smoke fish now."
"Thanks, dad. "
"I'm a humanitarian, so smokes are cheap and abundant "
[deleted]
"Fuck me congrats, I know there are dudes that smoked more each day but that's really good. Your future self will appreciate this more."
"Allen Carr for me too, 6 years off after 25 pack years. Never even been tempted."
Allen Carr worked for me. I had smoked for 16 years and quit in a weekend. It has been over three years now
"I've never read it, but I'm amazed how many people swear by that book."
I keep hearing about this book...is it seriously that good??
"For me it was the free ebooks at http://whyquit.com, maybe 5 years ago. But I got a chance to read Carr's book recently, and I can confirm it's good. "
"I quit after reading Allen Carr's book, too. It totally changed my thinking. It's a good book. :)
I was totally skeptical when I started reading it, too. I don't really believe in self-help type books, and thought I'd been suckered into some ""infomercial in a book"" type thing. Joke was on me, it worked. That was the first time. Then I started smoking again. I was really miserable because I had read a few people posting online that if you start smoking again after the Allen Carr book, that it won't work a second time, so I thought I'd messed up big time.
Nope. I smoked for about a year, then read the book again, and it really kicked in the second time. I quit in March of this year, and I'm happy I did."
Realized I was just being a stupid teenager that only smoked tobacco because I didn't have weed. 
"Stopped buying them and stopped talking about them.
Don't be one of those people who goes 3 days and tells everyone they've quit. Don't think about how long you've quit for. Don't let it rule your head. It has no power if you grant it none. 
Fuck anyone who thinks once a smoker always a smoker or those former alcoholics who say they'll always be an alcoholic. Bullshit.
Stop lying to yourself and getting in your own way. It's never as hard as it may seem to do the right thing."
"Yea, not telling anyone I was quitting helped a lot. I think I was on my second week when people started to ask if I was quitting."
I got salmonella from inhaling raw poultry.
Laughed way too hard at this
Tried it on a sandwich and never looked back. 
Just move to Australia... Cant afford to smoke
"One day I woke up tired of hacking up a lung and didn't want to feel like that anymore. 
I ate a lot of red licorice. 
But I did it. 
Cold turkey, working retail,  at Christmas. 
"
"I quit at a really stressful time, too. I was in the middle of my thesis and it was early winter (Christmas makes me angsty around my family), and a series of other stressors. It made it oddly easier to think I dealt with something tough at a tough time in my life."
"My Dad did it at 53 while in intensive care after his heart attack. Hard to smoke while you're on oxygen.
He tried to quit several times but this did it. 
He's still kickin' at 80 "
Didn't light another cigarette or buy another pack. 
"How many pack years did you have until that point?
Pack years: pack a day smoked per year"
"I tried to quit many times using different techniques, but what worked was realizing that I could never smoke even a single puff from a cigarette again, since that would just end up smoking the same again."
"If you seriously want to quit, then it works nicely. 
Because you don't have to think about it anymore. No counting cigarettes, no temptation to light just one more, just problem solved. 
The sensation of liberation far outweighs the slight addiction that will stay with you for like 48 hours. But even that addiction only works if there is the possibility to light a cigarette: if you have already quit, the craving are not strong, because there's nothing you can do about it."
"Tried to quit dozens of times.  I was finally able to quit, with no ""final smoke"" or second thoughts, when my wife announced she was pregnant.  "
"That is great to read. I see so many parents smoking while their kids are around, I cannot comprehend this. You had a great attitude, and congratulations for your child to come. "
"10 push ups every time I wanted to step out and smoke. It was also the 4th or 5th time I quit. Quitting takes practice, don't be too hard on yourself if you fail the first time."
10 push ups is about as long as a nic fit last. So that would work well. 
"I smoked for about 20 years, a pack to about a pack and a half a day, then one day I just quit.
It really didn't take a lot of effort on my part.
The heart attack helped, though.
There is no pain quite like a heart attack. It is intense, it gets you right at the core, and you can't get away from it. You can't distract yourself from it. You can't ignore it. You know you are dying.
Right before the anesthesiologist put me under the surgeon asked me if I was going to quit smoking, because if I didn't, then he was just practicing. I told him I would. 
They brought my wife in, and let us say goodbye before they put me fully under.
One four barrel bypass and three months later, I finally woke up.
As I was in a coma for almost three months, I missed most of the withdrawal symptoms, which I guess was fortunate. Being in the hospital for another few months also helped, as it was a non smoking campus.
After being discharged, I still had cravings for cigarettes, which weren't helped by people smoking around me. I vaped for a while, at 0% nicotine when smokers were over, or when I was at their homes, and while that helped I eventually just had to tell my smoking friends and relatives to take it outside. 
So, I did quit nicotine cold, but I really cannot recommend the method I used. If you keep smoking, though, you might get a chance to try it.
"
Well I switched over to vaping and now I'm on my way to quitting that. It's much easier to go a few hours without vaping than it is without a cigarette.
"I'm a month in now and I feel a lot better, I vape a lot less than I used to smoke and I'm down to 3mg!"
"I read the stories on this Web site and just stopped.
http://whyquit.com/"
"I read The Easy Way by Allen Carr in about 6 hours. It wasn't particularly well written, nothing in it was revolutionary. It just pummeled me in the face with the fact that smoking is an *addiction* and that the addiction wants to keep smoking, not me.  Honeslty by this point I was so absolutely sick of smoking that I would have taken a punch to the face if it meant not having to go to the store to buy smokes.
Separating myself from my addiction was the key. Realizing that the only time I didnt want to light up was when I was already smoking helped me realize that smoking didnt actively  allreviate the addiction, just delayed it. I needed to think of the smoker as separate from myself. I started imagining a mucinex troll in my brain begging for a smoke. And Everytime I told it no, it would sputter and hack and cough and die. The little shit is still there in my brain, limp and with one eye cracked juuust a little bit open; waiting to catch me off guard. 
I won't hide the fact that weeks 5-8 were the hardest, that's when the addition was over enough for my brain to start focusing on other things. Things that until then had been nicely hidden by my crutch, smoking. Suddenly I had no defense or coping mechanisms. Panic attacks became a nearly daily thing. I had to relearn how to cope with stress entirely. It sucked. But the FREEDOM that I have from goddamned cigarettes is absolutely worth all the strife. "
"I had a class in college called Behavioral Self Change. Basically, it teaches you how to change things about yourself that you want to change such as quitting smoking or losing weight. The methods described actually worked. I started the class in August, it ended in December, and I quit smoking January 1, 2013. 
What it boils down to is having a plan. Plan ahead for your quit date. Start to think and realize when you are craving a smoke. Plan for these. Don't depend on just one thing, either. For me, I just needed a distraction. I realized that if I was involved in doing something, I could go hours without a smoke and not realize it until someone else brought it up. My plan was to drink a bottle of water, or have a piece of gum, or get on my phone and play Tetris for a few minutes. As for when I was driving, I had a rubber band on my left wrist that I played with while I drove. 
Funny story. 9 days after quitting, I was driving my sister's car in downtown Daytona Beach with my best friend. We got rear ended by a much bigger vehicle. Both my sister and my best friend are smokers. I was able to resist having a smoke with them because I had plenty of water and gum and I had a plan and I stuck to it. It's been 4 years now and I don't regret a thing. Don't turn a slip into a fall, either."
Meditating about the fact that smoking made my life miserable and there was absolutely zero upside in it.
"Yeah, the cost is ridiculous, in Canada it's $10 a pack, that's $3,650/yr in three years that's over $10K cash... health consequences aside, the financial waste is terrible. "
"Not sure if this counts, but I quit within 3 days, with the help of a nicotine patch. I used 2/3rds of a patch on the first day, half on the second day and a quarter on the third day so that by the third day I was free of the chemical addiction to nicotine. Basically the nicotine patch cushioned the blow of giving up, while I could also start getting used to not having the hand to mouth habit of smoking.
Been 10 years now. 
One other thing that helped was that when I quit I believed myself to be a non smoker from that point on, which really helped me let go of the idea of 'giving up' or 'trying not to smoke'. Those types of thoughts actually hook you back in to having the mindset of a smoker."
First day was hardest. Getting past those moments that would include smoking was hard the first time each. I just did not stop quitting. Thirty years clean now. 
"By accident.  
  
The gas station I worked at back then had packs of Santa Fe for $2.70 a pack.  For that price, I would have smoked newspaper.  So, I get a pack, get about hlfway through, and realize that there's basically no nicotine in them.  I accidentally got over the nicotine dependancy, so I finished the pack and quit.  "
Vaping honestly. Then I quit that after about a year as well. Occasionally have a tank if I'm feeling stressed. Psyched though- smoking was becoming an issue. 
"It took about 6 or 7 tried. I'd usually make it a few weeks then buy a pack. I kept trying and one day it just stuck. Its a process, even if you start smoking again keep trying to quit."
"I'm an ICU nurse and I stopped the night I took care of a patient literally drowning from lung cancer (there were no palliative care beds available). The smell, the noises, everything he had to go through was enough for me to never touch a cigarette ever again (2y2m7d clean now)."
"I started smoking when I was 20 to show a girlfriend how easy it would be to quit. I promised to smoke for a year and then quit. That failed miserably. I smoked for 27 years. I had tried to quit several times and would do ok for a week or 2. I even quit once for a few months, but each time something would happen and I would justify smoking just one pack and that pack would become the habit all over again. Then I chose to make a deal with myself and to be true to my word to myself. I had 4 packs and I smoked them all in one day. The day before I left on a week long camping trip where I never smoked. Before I left I took the shirt I wore while doing the smoking which stunk of stale smoke. I kept it in a baggie. I went on the camping trip and I was occupied with staying warm and doing camping stuff so the withdrawals were not that bad. When I returned I wanted a cig. I would smell that shirt in the baggie and could resist. I also stopped hanging out with friends that smoked. I've been smoke free for 5 years and yet there are days where I still crave. I still have the stinky t-shirt in the baggie...somewhere. Good luck. "
"Changed my habits. Drive a different way to work, cleaned my car so it didn't stink, took walks on my breaks instead of going for a puff. Drank cold water like a crazy person and brushed my teeth a lot! The first week was the worse! "
My wife just nagged and nagged and nagged about it until it was no longer enjoyable.
"This last time... over 1 1/2 years quit now... hot peppers and pickles. Got tired of gaining weight from eating everything in sight whenever I quit. Ate pickles when I wanted to eat, ate hot peppers when I wanted to smoke. "
"Bubble gum. AND LOTS OF IT. I chewed tobacco and smoked cigarettes everyday for about 5 years. Decided after the new girlfriend hated it (and was pregnant with my child) that it was time to quit. Got some gum, chewed it like a savage. My son was born, we got engaged, decided why not and quit drinking alcohol too..been completely sober from everything for around 1.5 years and roughly 3 years from tobacco products..it's great try it! Don't give up!"
My dad did it by cheking himself into rehab for his drinking problem. The hospital didn't allow for smoke breaks so he ended up quitting while he was there. He has been sober AND smoke fee for a month now and I couldn't be more proud.
"I just stopped. Simple as that.
Not the answer you probably wanted to hear but roughly 3 years ago I just thought to myself ""I don't want to be doing this anymore"" and just stopped.
I think it's a will thing personally. There is always gonna be part of you that says you can't do it, but you need to listen to that small part that says you can.
I actually keep the same pack I was on when I quit with me everyday. Has 7 cigarettes left in it. Personally don't feel the urge. I carry it because everyone who knew I smoked kept talking behind my back about how I wouldn't last."
"I made sure i smoked my last cig on my day off.   The hardest thing for me was knowing I had a half a pack or even 3 left in the pack in my basement. 
I then proceeded to just think thoughts like I don't smoke cigarettes.   Never using the word anymore.   Never thinking I'm quitting for now. 
Just I don't smoke cigarettes. 
Working well for me so far. "
"I realized, after many years of course, that it was just wrong and gross. I started smoking hot turkey instead and never looked back. "
"Was in my car on my way home, cigarettes where empty. Go left to the gas station and buy a new box, or go right and go to bed. I went to bed.
Now, it was a spontaneous decision. But I got some good subconscious impulses, like seeing a woman I looked up at walking around with breathing tubes.
Your body is nicotine free in 4 days, so don't use the gum, it will only make the addiction last longer.
Edit: smoked 16 years, was 32 when I quit for 4 glorious years."
"I was a two pack a day smoker for 12 years.  One Sunday morning I woke up, hacked up a bunch of brown phlegm into the sink like I did every morning, got some coffee and had my first cigarette of the day with it.  About two thirds of the way into the cigarette I decided that I didn't want to smoke anymore.  I was tired of spending money on it, tired of coughing all the time, tired of the smell of old smoke.  So I put it out and became a non smoker.  
I got a giant bag of cheap suckers that helped me get through the first month or so.  I would eat a sucker when I drove or when I was on the computer to simulate that hand-to-mouth habit that smoking gave me.  "
It was a lot easier smoking the turkey when it was aflame.
"Put the cigarettes in the cold turkey, then eat the cold turkey."
"Found out I was pregnant. I didn't actually intend to quit cold turkey, I had planned to taper down from my half pack a day habit. But I couldn't bring myself to smoke knowing I wouldn't be the only one effected. Now I am a non smoker and can't fathom why I did that to myself for so many years. "
"Got an ulcer in my small intestine that got to the point it almost killed me. Smoking would of made it worse. I decided I didn't want to die. It was a pretty easy decision, but still a bitch. "
"I got really sick and was in the hospital for 3 weeks. When I got out I figured I was already over the hard part, so I might as well stop. I still have dreams where I smoke though, which is strange."
"My dad was a hard core smoker and quit many years ago.  I asked him recently how he did it and he said he did by eating these super strong mints. Had them in the truck, in his lunch kit  and always in shirt pocket. He said stronger the mints the better. Hope someone who reads this will try it and be successful"
Which brand of mints?
"Didn't buy another pack, asked the person that carpool with me not to smoke in my car. I'm going on 2 months now."
I've quit cold turkey many times. 
"Smoked a pack a day for almost 5 years, not counting all the drunk cigarettes for years prior. I tried to go for a run one day and couldn't make it to the end of the block. It was then that I decided to change up my methods of stress relief. I started cutting down to 10 a day, then 5 a day, then 0. Each week I tried to run for longer periods at a time. It really helped to fight the cravings and gave me a goal to work towards. Now I don't have any desire to go back."
"I only smoked for like a year, i quit about a month ago. I woke up one morning and couldn't take a deep breath. Felt like my lungs collapsed. So after that i havent had the urge to pick one up "
"Quit working in restaurants, it just came naturally after that"
Cold turkey.
Well I just stopped smoking and that was it. There were no cravings because I didn't rely on it for some sort of stimulating effect. Just don't rely on a substance like that or you'll have a bad time.
"""I don't have to quit smoking. I'm just not going to smoke today. I can buy a pack tomorrow if I still I want to."" Told myself that everyday until I didn't crave it anymore. "
"I was in college, couldn't afford it anymore. Had some classmates that knew I was trying to quit, so they would bitch at me if I ever picked up a smoke."
"Just did it one day. Decided I was tired of walking from class to class and being out of breath. Decided not to smoke one day and that was it. For two weeks I felt like shit (cold sweats, hard time sleeping, cold like symptoms etc.) but in the end it was for the better. The hardest part of it was the mental part. Like times and activities where you would usually have a cigarette during or after such as driving, eating, drinking was hard. I would get in my car and think I could light up a cig but remembered that I was quitting. That went on for a while then finally faded. If you push yourself you can do it."
Shrooms. 10 years smoking and one batch of tea and shrooms and I never touched one again. I guess while tripping I just decided I was done 
"I've never smoked but my cousin's husband (cousband?) did and quit cold turkey. My maternal family is full of odd but lifelong medical problems (cousin with childhood cancer, BMT, GVHS), my sister has Down syndrome, loads of cancer, etc. When our Gran was diagnosed with dementia he quit cold turkey because the magnitude of all these medical issues freaked him out and made him realize life is short and health runs out."
"I tried everything (chantix, patch, gum) for about a year and a half straight with no help. Finally I got a bad flu where I slept for like 2 days. I was too sick to smoke and didn't get out of bed. After 2 days I decided to keep going. 
After about a week I got better and by then I realized that I hadn't smoked in a week and the worst part of quitting was over, the first week. After a year and a half of trying to quit I knew that if I gave up that progress I would never quit. Every time I wanted a cigarette I told myself how long it had been and I would lose the progress I'd made. 
It's been about 14 months without a cigarette and I've got myself so afraid of losing my progress I have nightmares about it every now and then. Probably not the healthiest, mentally speaking, way to quit but I guess it's healthier than smoking."
Replaced it with running. 
"Always wanted to quit, ran out of money 3 days before payday, come payday figured I may as well continue to not smoke, that was February 2014"
"I got a horrible case of bronchitis and was laid up on the couch for two days. That was it, I'd finally had enough. 15 years, some time at two packs a day. Every time I wanted one I just thought about the pain, the money, the smell of my clothes, the nasty butts, the overflowing ashtrays, the discolored nails, the breath..  Pretty soon I just stopped wanting them."
"For me there was no trick, I just stopped. The withdrawal sucked but after a week or so I didn't think about smoking anymore. Then I noticed I could breathe better, food tasted better. Smelling cigarette smoke now makes me want to vomit."
"After you try smoking it heated up, its hard to go back, honestly."
"I wanted to quit for a while but it was hard. I caught a really bad cold and I spent 5 days smoking while NOT enjoying it, this pissed me off so much I just said fuck it and quit. I used Nicotine lozenges for the first 2 weeks. Haven't smoked in 6 years now. I miss smoking, I liked it, but I enjoy breathing better and I'll live longer for my kids. "
Only smoked for 3-4 months so it was easy.  Never smoked again. 11 years now.
"I quit cold turkey 6 weeks ago.  A pack of cigarettes cost $15 where I live, and I'm poor, so money. "
"My dad quit smoking while back. He told he he would stick his fingers down his throat whenever he would inhale in smoke. Now whenever he smells cigarette smoke he dry heaves. He told me is worked liked a charm, ""Drag and Gag"" method."
"I spent Saturday, Sunday, and Monday (took a day off) in bed and didn't leave my room unless necessary, so that I could make it through the first three days okay. Multiple quitting attempts had taught me that those were my make or break days.
Been cigarette free for almost 3 years now."
"It was 99% psychological for me.  I set the date about 2 weeks out.  Let myself smoke.  Had my last cigarette on my back porch at 2 or 3 am. Enjoyed it, had a nice goodbye smoke. Didn't tell anyone. At all. Just stopped.  Never bought more, never smoked again. I was a 1 to 1.5 pack a day, ADDICTED smoker. I jjust told myself no more, and stopped.  I had little kids that were my main motivation for quitting.  I didn;t want them to see my smoking and think it was okay."
"Got pregnant. Was an avid smoker for 8 years. About a week before I even peed on the stick I started getting nauseous whenever I tried to smoke, which quickly developed into nasuea whenever I was in the presence of cigarettes. My son is almost a year and I still can't be anywhere around smoke. "
"Smoked 1/2-3/4 pack of Parliament Lights a day. One day, after I had been sick with bronchitis and hadn't smoked for a day or two, I came into class and sat down next to a friend. He smelled HORRIBLE. I realized it was the smell of stale cigarettes and I decided then and there I didn't want to be stinky anymore. So I kicked it old school: Bought my absolute least favorite cigarettes on earth (Pall Mall, filterless if my memory serves), and smoked them all in a row. It took a pretty long time. I got sick like I had never been sick before. I never bought another pack of cigarettes, and over the past 10 years since that happened, I have smoked maybe 4 cigs total, all while black out drunk. 
EDIT: I still crave cigs sometimes, especially when I am under a lot of stress. Smoking is a door that once opened is hard to ever fully close, but I like to think I have done a pretty good job of it. I have also told others about this technique and it's helped them quit as well. It's unpleasant, but works wonders. I highly recommend it."
Sever back pain and Osteoporosis. Bones had to get to normal ranges before Dr would do surgery. Hurting really bad from most recent trip to Dr. 4 hrs away. Laid them down and didn't look back. Been almost 4 yrs. 
"I know this might sound dumb, but I eliminated the word ""try"".   I smoked for over 20 years and tried three or four times to quit, all without success.  One particular day, for some strange reason, every cigarette tasted like shit.  I was driving home that evening and something just came over me.  This was the last pack of cigarettes I will ever buy.  I smoked my last two, and that was it.  I quit.  After I made that decision, whenever someone asked is I wanted to have a smoke, instead of saying, ""I am trying to quit"", I would reply, ""I quit"".  I know it sounds dumb, but it made the difference.  Have not had one since May of 2002.   One other thing I did, I changed one habit that triggered a craving.  "
"What do you mean ""how""? I just stopped a couple months ago, wasn't really trying to. I never really smoked when I was at my house and I've been a complete shut-in lately so it just sort of happened. "
"Don't know if my method will work for anyone else but it worked great for me! 
Step 1- I spent the two weeks before my quit date looking up everything I could on smoking related diseases/deaths. I got it in my head that I will die violently and painfully if I don't quit. 
Step 2- I got violently drunk the night before quit date. I smoked the rest of my pack that night too which was way more than I usually smoked during a night of drinking. 
Step 3- woke up with massive hangover and smelling like an ash tray. 
Step 4- convinced myself that my hangover was due to smoking only. Basically I channeled all my pain into the belief that it was caused by smoking. If done right, you will be physically nauseous at the thought of having a cigarette. 
Step 5- threw away all my lighters. Put hurdles between you and lighting up again. 
I wss good for a week before the cravings started again, which brings me to my next trick- the air cigarette. Pretend your holding an imaginary cigarette between your fingers and pull a drag through them. Your brain will think your smoking and the craving will die. 
 
Eventually you become so proud of your progress that you will have control again when offered a cigarette in the future. "
"I simply stopped buying them. Was miserable for awhile, but it worked. Craving isn't something you can control, but it takes conscious effort to go to the store and buy a pack. I more quit buying them than quit smoking. I then just never had smokes to smoke. Eventually the cravings went away. (Smoked pack a day for ~6 years? Not as long as most I'm sure)"
I had a golf pencil I held like a cigarette.  Tapped it like I was flicking ash off it.  Sometimes even stuck it in my mouth.  Smoked for 18 years.  Two years smoke free.
Quitting is easy. I've done it lots of times.
"I don't smoke, but My Dad quit cold turkey.. I think 16 years ago. He said the thing with trying to quit smoking is most of the time people always say how they will have ""just one more"", or ""I'll only have this last one."" He said he never had ""just one more"". He just quit. He focused on other things. I know back then he was really big on building these airplanes you can fly through the air. So I think having something to focus on helps tremendously. 
You don't need one more though. "
I kept telling myself that I had just finished one. I kept doing it and kept doing it for so long that all of a sudden I had quit.
"I woke up the morning, after a long day of snowboarding and drinking the day before, with a nasty cold. Sore throat, aches, the whole 9. I decided that that was it, I was done smoking. I downloaded an app that keeps track of how long it had been since my last cigarette and told myself I wouldn't reset it, that having to reset the app would mean I had no self control. 
I'm at 3 years, 35 weeks, 2 days, 21 hours, 15ish minutes. I had nightmares about having a cigarette and the feeling of letting myself down. Never once reset the app and still have the occasional nightmare, but no cravings for cigarettes anymore."
"I consider myself to have quit cold turkey, because I didn't step down or taper my nicotine consumption. But, I *DID* radically alter my vehicle of administration with, of all things, snus. There's too much backstory to include here, but the bottom line is that I transitioned from a long-time, full-time smoker who had NEVER tried to quit before, to 3 weeks of exclusive snus use. If anything, I ingested far more nicotine during those three weeks than normal, but the onset of oral administration is delayed, and my addictive response started to weaken, while my lungs and sinuses cleared. Honestly, I more than once made myself sick with excess nicotine, but nevertheless the delayed gratification gave me ""breathing room"", and I started to imagine that I could succeed at quitting.
I'd never even tried to quit before, and I wasn't trying that time either, at the most I hoped I could switch my addiction to something less lethal than cigarettes. Three weeks later I was done, and 4.5 years later I'm still done. And that's the end of that story."
It was to tough to get it to light
Well. I had no money. And i wasnt about to ask people to buy me cigs. I hate being a bum/leech. So i quit. Been smoke free for about 2 years now
"I smoked for about 6 years but after countless bouts of bronchitis, I was tired of getting sick. I had almost quit 3 times previously but lapsed for one reason or another. 
Top things that helped me. 
Keeping 3 cigarettes on my desk to stare at while I played video games. It made me feel better having them there as I went through withdrawal. 
Instead of smoking on my lunch break, I used the money that I would piss away on cigarettes and buy a healthy and delicious lunch. It was nice to have disposable income for lunches. I was massively under weight while I smoked (6-4 and 165lbs).
 
Started exercising a bit and avoiding the most tempting locations for smoking (bars, clubs etc) for the first few months after quitting."
I pretty much woke up one day and wanted to go for a 1 mile run. I made it about 1/4 of the way and said I gotta stop smoking. So I quit plus prices were going up on them in Michigan. Started drinking more which I guess isn't the best of trade off but I still did it.
"Started smoking a little less each time. Bought stronger smokes that had a flavor I didn't like. They'd get stale, I'd forget what I was in this for. The biggest thing is to break routine. Your smoking is a routine as well as an addiction. One requires medication, one requires dedication."
"i made the realization that as an already lazy person, all i had to do was become slightly more lazy. that change of mind made it pretty easy to do, i had been smoking for roughly 5-7 years at that point and have not looked back"
"I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled at the same time.  It was so painful to pucker up I couldn't smoke for 5 days.  I told myself if I could quit for 5 days, I could do it for 6.  Just one day at a time after that."
"sheer mental fortitude.  i told myself i would stop, and i did.  "
Jellybeans. Smoked for about 10 years. Almost a pack a day. One day I realized I fucking hated smoking. I tried to quit many times but the last time was cold turkey. That was about 8 years ago. Ate a shit tone of jellybeans though. Except the black ones. They're gross too.
Locked myself in a room laid on the couch and watched tv. Also whyquit. Com and the daily videos helped me.
"I started running. I decided I wanted to run a half-marathon so I started training for it. I was able to go cold turkey for a long time. I had a couple relapses (so I guess it doesn't fully count), but those relapses were one or two cigarettes when I was out drinking. It happened once a month or so. But then my runs would be noticeably harder. Eventually, I just stopped completely and now it's been months. I have zero desire to start again, even when I'm out drinking and see other people smoke. "
Anytime I quit anything I do I wait for a day that has significance. Quit on a friends birthday as a present to them. It will make you feel shit if you go back on it plus it will always give you a marker for how long it's been 
"Food and challenging myself by putting me in situations where I may cave with the sole purpose of not no matter how much I wanted to.
I also thought, it's  really just a month of nothing but craving anither cigarette and then a whole life of not smoking again."
"Wasn't a hardcore chain smoker for 15 years and so, only smoked for about 2 years. I went smoking one time and this girl I knew pretty was standing with a couple of people, and I went up and she said, ""hey rchae94 you smell like cigarettes, you should stop."" 
It wasn't condenscending at all (we always joked), but I decided to stop there. Cold turkey is only tough if you don't keep yourself occupied imo."
Just stop putting them in your mouth 
"I got to the point where I couldn't perform my job how I wanted to. When I was able to actually feel the physical effects of smoking, I put that shit down without thinking twice. 
Granted, I was never the guy that smoked because I felt like I needed to. I just did it because I enjoyed it and it was something to do.
But quitting wasn't really hard. You just need to find the right reason for you. As soon as you get that one idea in your head that becomes more important that smoking, that's all you need. "
"Pre-surgery; one last cigarette after decades of smoking - then nothing.  I knew I'd be so whacked out on pain meds - I wouldn't feel the withdrawal.  (Surgery scheduled wasn't something caused by smoking)  Eight years later, still get urges -- but would never dare."
"The thing I always recommend is quit for a week, then try to smoke a cigarette.
They taste like absolute shit.
I was smoking two packs of Reds a day and this is how I quit. 
Get sunflower seeds as well and replace that with the habit of smoking"
"its gonna sound wanky, but i just stopped. 
been smoking over 10 years and one day I ran out of smokes, it was 3am, so nowhere to get more and i just thought ""fuck it"" and havent had one since, first week was a hard but it was more the habit of going outside during work breaks and stuff that I found hard. 
Other than that, thats it... just occupied the mind with some other stuff...."
"pure, unadulterated rage.
pack a day smoker for 10-12 years. woke up one morning with a bad case of bronchitis. feverish, painful cough, the works. 
and i was low on smokes. fuck.
all i wanted out of life was to lay in bed and be miserable, but nooooooooooOOOooooooOOOooo. i hadda get up, get dressed, and drive down to the motherjumping store to buy more stupid cigarettes because i was addicted.
i felt like a slave and wasn't happy about it. worked myself up into such a lather that by the time i got to the CVS near my place to buy cigarettes, i bought some cold meds and a pint of ice cream instead. went home and hated life for a few days.
been good ever since."
"Try this. Every time you instinctively reach for a cigarette ask yourself this, ""do I really need/want to smoke it right now?""
Can you wait till later? Is there anything else to do?
Sure the answer may be yes sometimes but after a while you stop caring about smoking because you get bored of it.
Now I feel it's such a hassle to do.
I didn't ""quit"" smoking. I just eventually didn't want to anymore."
Sheer ignorant willpower. I just stopped and was too proud to fail. 
"Throw away all you paraphernalia. Ash trays, lights, matches, cellophane, everything needs to go. Take all your trash outside, clean everything. Remove the smell for anything that has it. 
Next, lock yourself inside for 3 days at least. Stock up on cinnamon candy, movies, and pesto bismal. Just lock yourself away from the world  Ifor you deink, avoid drinking and bars for a month.
The first eek is the hardest, after that it's really easy. Start working out too. Once you start getting into shape after smoking you won't want to go back. "
My brother-in-law quit cold turkey; he said he did it by visualizing himself as a non-smoker. Apparently that worked. 
I moved to a new city into a non smoking building where the only option is to go downstairs and outside to smoke. 
"Read Allan carr's *easy way to quite smoking* and haven't even considered smoking again. That ten dollar book was the best money I've ever spent. I was so blown away by how easy it actually was that I now buy that book where I find it used and have given it to literally every person I know who smokes. All of them quit cold turkey too. That book was literally life changing. If you smoke, go buy it."
"One day I woke up and I felt an odd tightness in my chest and it hurt every time I moved a certain way. This scared the living shit out of me and I never wanted to experience this feeling again. So in a way I'm not even sure if the smoking caused the chest pain though I assume that's what it was, that pain made me vow to not destroy my body anymore because I had big plans and never wanted to feel limited by smoking. I smoked once more when I was drunk three months later but besides that, that was the last time I ever smoked a cig. "
"I think you just have to find a reason that resonates with you.  It can't be because it's bad for you because you know it's bad for you and that obviously doesn't work.  It has nullified the part of your brain that cares about how bad it is for you.  It can't be for anyone else like a boyfriend or a wife or a child, because you will definitely relapse.  It has to be for you and it has to be for a reason other than the obvious reasons.
For me, it was finding out that Phillip Morris systematically destroyed indigenous populations in the amazon.  They go out there and employ natives for pennies a day and have them spray chemicals that are too strong to legally use in the US.  The get around the safety problem by saying they put a skull and cross bones symbol on them to make sure everyone (even those who can't speak English) know it's poison.  However, in their culture a skull and cross bones is a sign of the spirit and because the pesticides make the plants grow big and tall they spray it on their children to give them strength.  This is entirely wiped out many tribes and this just isn't stuff you hear about in the news because nobody cares about these people.  We don't and in the countries where they live they are usually considered bottom wrung citizens, so not even their own country cares enough to protect them from this kind of exploitation, and even encourages it sometimes.  Really fucking sad shit.  After hearing that I was able to quit cold turkey because fuck those assholes.  And you can go ahead and say you don't buy cigarettes from Phillip Morris...  mk.  But, if you smoke cigarettes and you're out and the only thing around is a Marlboro, you're gunna bum it and you're gunna smoke it.  If you don't smoke at all, it wont be an issue."
"This is kinda weird, but I ate a fair number of candy cigarettes (while by myself or with friends who knew I was quitting.) It was nice to have something to do with my hands and mouth. "
It was hard to smoke cold turkey. Damn cigarettes with cold turkey in them won't stay lit. So I quit. 
"I switched to e cigs, were on those for about a year. Went to Colorado once to visit family for a week or so, forgot my e cig, and surprisingly never had a craving the entire time I was there. Came home, started exercising regularly and haven't smoked a cig or e cig since. 
Edit: I would say I was a heavy smoker. At least a pack a day. Exercising helped the most. "
"Vaping. Instantly sold on the first puff, never wanted nasty burnt ass over fruity goodness again."
Got hypnotized & followed up with meditation. 
"Got real sick with a throat infection and ran out of cash. Thought to myself ""no better time than now""
That was about 4 weeks ago. Still going strong!"
"I have lots of thoughts on this, I finally quit for good almost ten years ago.  
1. You can't lament it.  Your can't sit around even for one second thinking about how much you miss it and  how much forever is going to suck without it.  You're doing it, now move the fuck on and aggressively pursue some healthy habits.  Channel that energy  into something positive.  Jog, box, do pushups, whatever.
2.  You absolutely can not have even one drag ever ever ever again.  No matter how far behind you it all seems, don't ever do it again.  Ever.  Know yourself.  Know that you are not one of those people who can have an occasional cigarette.  You're just not.  It's never an option again.  Not ever.
3.  To get through the first week give yourself permission to do absolutely anything (within reason) except smoke.  If you want scotch and McDonald's for every meal for a solid week, do that.  But don't smoke.  I'd you want to jerk off 6 times a day for the first week, do it.  But don't smoke.  If you want to go to home depot to buy yourself a bunch of dry wall to bring home to punch holes in every 15 minutes go right ahead.  Doing all of this for one week is far better than smoking for another  several years.  It just is.  Also, if you need a  shit load of time alone for that first week find a way to make it happen.  Do whatever it takes for one week, just don't smoke.
4. Find your own personal  asshole. Let me explain: This one asshole coworker of mine said to me when I'd quit around 2 weeks ""  you'll be smoking again in no time.""  This was the best thing anyone could have done for me.  I hated that fucking dick for saying that.  And I still think of him every time I want a cigarette, which  I'll admit isn't often anymore.  Fuck that guy, after he said that my resolve was incredibly strong.  No fucking way was I ever smoking again.  If there's some ass hole naysayer in your life use that energy you have that wants to strangle them, channel that into something positive and think of that prick every time you're tempted.   And know you  can do this.  Move the fuck on.  Get past this, you have your whole life ahead of you and it's just better without having to smoke all the time.
Now get it done."
"By vaping.  It's barely even quitting.  It's just smoking a different way.   Although it's switching one habit for another, vaping is much cleaner, healthier, and easier to put down than cigarettes.  "
I didn't even know smoking cold turkey was a thing...TIL
"One break at a time. One car ride at a time.
Whatever your triggers for smoking are, just don't do it *that time*. Don't think about the future or ""being a non-smoker."" Just focus on *now*. If I could go ten minutes, I could go an hour. If I could go an hour, I could go four hours. If I could go four hours, a whole day, and so on.
I smoked for about 16 years. I quit smoking eight years ago. "
Cinnamon dipped toothpicks 
"I met who I thought was the one. I didn't think there would be any way she would be with me if I smoked, so I quit. Then when we broke up, I picked up the habit again. Still waiting on the right one, I guess."
"I started warming it up first, cold turkey is good but warm turkey is great!"
"I was dumped by my girlfriend who was the one that originally got me to start smoking in the first place.
"
"It wasn't that hard, the key is wanting to stop."
Thought about it objectively and realized the only reason I continued to smoke was because I smoked. Once I understood how recursive the whole process was and that continuing to do so will undoubtedly be the death of me I found that the urge to not smoke was more powerful than the 5-10 minute craving episodes to smoke 
"My husband did when I told him that the cigarettes made his semen taste horrible enough to make me gag. So, there's some inspiration for ya, fellas."
"Since I wasnt working I jumped on my bike and rode, and rode. If I kept riding I couldnt stop for a smoke, and it also helped with the coughing and stuff once it hits you from quitting, since you can choke your lungs up while riding, and spit it all out."
"Constantly staying busy with something. Any idle moments in the first couple of days of quitting and you'll be right back to the pack.  
Also, something equally as important.  During that first week, avoiding anything or anybody that'll encourage you smoking.  For me, when I quit this last time (hopefully the final time), I could not drink booze, goto the bar, or see most of my friends considering they all pretty much smoke.  Any one of those scenarios would put me in fuck-it mode and i'd light up."
I stopped cold turkey and I started working out at the same time. Good way to evacuate my frustrations/stress.
"Research shows most people who quit successfully quit cold turkey. Success is defined as not using tobacco for at least one year after quitting. On average, those who are successful try seven times before attaining success, so you should expect setbacks.
Symptoms of physical addiction will subside almost entirely after three days. The next biggest problem is the habits: You answer the phone, you light up; you get in your car, you light up; you have a cup of coffee you light up. Find a way to change your habits: hold your phone in your other hand, or use a bluetooth earpiece; get your car detailed and/or let your SO drive; use/stop using cream and sugar in your coffee, or switch to tea or some other beverage.
What gets most people in the end is the psychological aspect. You've seen the old movie trope where the person who hasn't smoked for years suddenly starts again after some stressful life-changing event. That's not inaccurate. Smoking is a source of stress relief for most smokers, so when you get really stressed you'll feel an exceptionally strong urge to light up. The key is to have a plan in place, because you KNOW you will get stressed about something sometime in the future. 
Some ideas: Write a list of all the things you do that bring you joy. Decide that when you get stressed you will do everything on the list (or as much as practical) before lighting up. Make an agreement with someone you trust that you can call anytime who will help. Have a plan in place detailing how you will deal with the aftermath of a slip up. Many quitters who give in and have a smoke during a stressful period decide that's it, they're back to smoking. THAT'S NOT SO UNLESS YOU DECIDE IT'S SO! If you understand you will likely make mistakes and plan for them (reaffirm to yourself your commitment to quit; talk with someone who knows you are trying to quit to get some encouragement, be willing to start over, etc.) you don't have to give up ALL the gains you've made. Above all, understand each slip up is an opportunity to understand the kinds of situations that can trigger you to smoke and either avoid them, or have a plan to deal with them.
Send me a PM if you want; I'll help if I can.
Good luck!!! "
"I made the decision to quit and did it on the spot. That was over 20 years ago. I threw away the rest of my cigarettes and never asked for one or bought one again. The trap is when people say ""I'll quit when X happens"", or ""I'll quit on X particular day"". That shit never happens. People change their mind or forget they called out a particular day or event. Also, if you quit for anyone other than yourself, you're probably going to fail."
"I told myself everyday, many many times ""I am not a smoker, that is not who I am."" Perhaps sounds a bit weird to some people but helped me kick the habit."
Not a smoker but my dad was. He quit cold turkey when my brother ate a cigarette butt.
"A mix of exercise and thinking of having a stroke later in life every time I went out to have a cigarette. It was no longer relaxing or enjoyable after that, I couldn't get my mind off the fact what I was doing would leave half my body paralyzed. Now it's not a guarantee that would happen, of course, but it's a rational possibility. It ""helped"" that my own father had a stroke when I was in middle school, not related to smoking, so I had an idea of how fucked up a stroke is."
"I remember laying down in bed when I got woken up by a jolt and it was almost like losing conciousness for a second.  It was really quick.  I felt my blood vessels pound, my neck vessels especially.  Anyways, didn't really get it right away I just went back to sleep.
Couple of weeks go by and I get Medic Aid from Obama Care.  Pretty awesome to be honest, so I go to the local clinic and tell them about having shortness of breath and fast heart beating.  Well sure enough, high blood pressure.  I knew what that meant but even if they had told me I would have stopped smoking.  Anyways, once I found out I quit cold turkey.  
About a year goes by and I guess I've improved, and decide to see if I could handle a cigarette from a friend.  Nope, I cough because the smoke is hurting my lungs, and that's how I quit finally.  My lungs were almost back to normal and I took it from there.
However, I do sometimes want a cigarette.  See, when I would smoke I would go outside and be by myself usually late at night.  I live next to a canyon so I would love my time alone down there just listening to the night birds and watching the stars.  I still miss it, especially when it was raining.  I loved sitting down and watching the enviroment through puffs of smoke.  
I don't go outside anymore although I should.  It's just that, for some reason, smoking was an antisocial/social thing for me.  I wanted to be by myself, alone and being quiet looking at the night sky.  So I understand the allure of smoking.  I mean if you do it to look cool, or because everyone does it, then well I guess.  Although that is how it started for me.  It's just that now, I think about having high blood pressure again, or the fact that I donate plasma and it's my only source of income currently I don't want to ruin.  I also don't want cancer of course, so I have to shake my head whenever the thought of buying a pack crosses my mind.
So I wouldn't say I quit entirely, since I still feel the need of smoking just to smoke.  I just weigh the pros and cons and I just don't want cancer."
"I quit using chewing tobacco a few months back. I just decided I was done and wasn't gonna buy anymore. 
Finished the can I had left, and never bought another. I still get a craving sometimes, especially when it's out of habit - driving, playing golf, etc. 
I'll sometimes still reach for my back pocket like it's still there, but it's not. "
"I had switched to vaping for a month or so before I read a book by a man called Allan Carr. It worked a treat for me.
You will only quit when you want to."
Allen carrs guide to quit smoking and agmatine. 
"I smoked from ages 12 to 28. One day I smoked my last cigarette on the way home from work and forgot to pick up another pack. Before I realized it I had been without one for a few days. Been a little over two years now, and sometimes I even dream about smoking. "
"Been smoke free for about 4 years now and had been smoking for close to 10 years at about 1/2 a pack to a pack a day. Quit cold turkey one day when I just couldn't afford it anymore. I knew that it was going to be my last pack. I bought the soft peppermint sticks that you see a lot around Christmas time and munched on those as a craving hit. The stick hanging out of the mouth, for me, resembled a cigarette subconsciously and it really helped. "
Never stopped trying.. after 70+ attempts it worked like a charm..
"I've always wondered, is it actually *that hard* , or is it more of a having to adjust your life style as you get so used to living while incorporating smoking into your routine..?"
Quit as I graduated from college. Coiciding it with a huge life change helps. What helped the most was asking myself a question. Where does quitting smoking rank on the list of stuff you want to accomplish? Not very high. Then how the hell do you plan to accomplish the things high up on this list if you can't even do the little ones? Stopped cold turkey.
"Just decided I was done smoking. I told myself I wasn't addicted for years because ""I just buy packs, if I ever seriously consider buying a carton, I'll know I'm in too deep and I'll quit.""
Walked into Costco to buy a carton of Camel Turkish Silvers and went ""Nope. Fuck this. I'm out."" Bought a huge family sized pack of chewing gum. Chewed gum for a while, started exercising. 
Ran a triathlon a few years later, then started doing tough mudders and weight lifting. Just hit my body weight for my bench press 1rep max. 
I miss smoking. But holy shit do I love exercising. "
Smoking stale cigarettes got me off real quick
I went to basic training 
"Tried numerous times to quit without success.
Then I picked up a hobby where smoking would severely hinder my performance (in my case, cycling).
Loved going fast but sensed that smoking was holding me back. 
Haven't touched a ciggie for almost a year now. And gotten much faster."
Decided I was done. Quit right then & there. That's all there was to it. I've been smoke free for 16 years!
I went from a pack a day to none by just smoking weed when I had a craving 
blunts or a pipe? 
"Well I started noticing when I craved nicotine and then I said to myself if I want it this bad I need to be able to control it. So I made it a test of my will power, every time I felt it, I would sort of make it my enemy and resist it even more."
"Picked it up on deployment out of sheer boredom. Deployment ended, and said fuck it. Literally just like that"
Have a good reason! 
"Spent a week in hospital, confined to bed.
When I got out, I had lost the urge.
Knew from the first day that if I made it a whole week without a smoke, I would be off them for life.
I was a 20 cigs a day man.
Now I am ashamed of the money I literally burnt for 30 years.
"
"I ate sunflower seeds everytime I wanted a cigarette. Got addicted to them for a while, but it was a lot better than smoking."
"My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer at age of 47. He quit smoking the very day. It didn't take any effort. He was smoke free for about two years
However that was too late"
Had a friend whose mother was a chain smoker. Friend decided to douse the box in water then throw it in the freezer to try and stop her mum from smoking. It worked.
"A family friend died a painful and drawn out death from lung cancer, I quit the day after he died. Every time I think about smoking I think of Frank. "
[deleted]
*What are you talking about?! Quitting smoking is the easiest thing in the world! I do it 15 times a day!*
For me it was a mental thing. Smoking is doing something. So to stop smoking I don't even have to do anything. Results may vary. The most I smoked was like 3 for a year and half so I never considered myself a very heavy smoker.
"I just went somewhere where cigarettes were unavailable and instead of occupying myself with nicotine, I worked hard and made conversation with interesting people.
I did start smoking again, but they turned me on to smoking herbs and I have found that I can barely tolerate commercially available straight tobacco."
"How do you smoke something cold, wouldn't it have to be burning to smoke it."
"####**Stop fucking smoking.**
You want to smoke? Don't. Don't put yourself in positions where you can smoke, and stop buying cigarettes. Really it isn't that hard. You just have to stop fucking smoking.
Either that, or do a bunch of hookah until the thought of tobacco makes you nauseous."
"I smoked hand-rolled cigs for about a 6-8 month period. Never found the packaged ones very appealing. I generally smoked once a day, sometimes twice. One day I just started getting headaches after a drag or two, so I just stopped cold.
I suppose I hadn't smoked enough to develop any sort of addiction, so it was easy. Even if I were to have had a craving, the prospect of pain in the dome was good enough motivation to abstain."
