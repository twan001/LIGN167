"I smoked for 15 years, about half a pack a day. So not heavy, but definitely addicted.  15 years and 30 days ago, I started taking wellbutrin (buproprion) and ten days after that, I stopped smoking.  Other than a few vivid and weird dreams the first week, I had no problems with it - in fact, I still take it as an anti-depressant.
I haven't had a cigarette since, nor do I want one.  Now when I walk past someone smoking, I can hardly breathe. I can't imagine how I ever smoked."
ecigs and swedish snuss really helped me:)
"My method:  not buying more.  That's that whole thing about ""quitting"".  You actually have to make an effort to purchase them.  Stop making that effort.  Have a little willpower.  Ok, have a lot of willpower, but STOP buying them.  Every time you go to buy some realize what a jerk you're being and just don't do it."

is that because the only people you know are wow players?
"I quit smoking Dec 15th 2012. I used the patch for about 5 or 6 weeks. I used steps 1 and 2. In hindsight only having been about a 1/2 a pack a day smoker I could have probably just done step 2 and then step 3.
Edit: I had tried cold turkey about 5 other times with no success. After talking to my doctor he said to try nicotine replacement before trying meds like a chantix or something like that."
"Thats what I did, something always brought me back though.
I'm down to < 5 a day, somedays < 2.   Hopeing to cut it out altogether soon, but patches are kind of iffy becuase they just hook me to a nice even supply of nicotine that makes smoking cigarettes like chasing the dragon."
"I accidentally swapped to e-cigs without ever really intending to quit. 
I'd tried out the disposable ones you get in convenience stores and dismissed them as crap, but at a trade show the guy on the stand next to me was showing off his new toy (an ego twist) and raving about how great it was. . 
I'd just moved house at the time and was doing my best to avoid smoking indoors this time round. As his ego looked significantly better than the disposable ones, i thought it was worth a go as a stopgap and hope i'd have the discipline to go outside for the real thing.  
The assortment of kit i'd ordered arrived in due course, and for the next few days i didn't smoke atall, partly because i was playing with my new toy but mostly because the nicotine liquid i'd ordered myself was ridiculously strong and making my head spin (i'd assumed as a 40 a day smoker i'd want the highest strength available).
On the 4th day i decided to have a real smoke and was amazed at just how crappy it tasted, so i didn't have another. Around a month later curiosity got the better of me, and it was so foul i threw it away after the 2nd drag and announced to myself that i'd officially given up on cigarettes. 
While i know I've only moved the goal-posts a bit, as I'm still officially addicted to nicotine, I am nevertheless extremely happy with how e-cigs have worked out for me. (especially since i didn't intend quit in the first place, i view them more as an upgrade than a substitute.) "
"FOR ME: I switched, temporarily to an electronic cigarette (eGo Twist, fruity yummy juice, 6mg nicotine) and replaced the reactionary cigarette smoking (after dinner, after getting laid, driving) with reactionary weed smoking. I'm disabled, so I could get away with doing this. I used the e-cig as maintenance throughout the day, a few hits here and there. It tasted good, I could smoke indoors, and it only cost me about 4 weeks of cigarette smoking, monetarily speaking - around $100.
I stopped buying Nicotine e-juice and just vape for flavor & muscle memory's sake. It's a way to keep ""smoking,"" but in a way that isn't AS harmful to myself and others. I spend MAYBE 20$ a month now on smoking, and I quit smoking copious amounts of weed after the second week. Now I'm back to being a casual daily pot smoker, I can even tolerate having a cigarette at the bar without buying any, and I literally tripled my gym workout.
tl;dr Shift around your other vices to make it work, smoke enough weed that you are way too lazy to go outside."
"I quit cold turkey about two months ago, been smoking for about 5 years. I'm going strong, celebrated two months without a smoke on January 27, so I'm happy! I just decided one day that it wasn't doing me any good to be smoking, and it just wasn't cool anymore."
"Zyban (wellbutrin), sunflower seeds, butterscotch candies, hot tea and 2 years of willpower."
"I went into inpatient treatment for alcoholism (one where they didn't allow smoking.) Desperate times, man. "
cold turkey and white knuckles. good luck.
"I had to do it cold turkey, and it's been more than a year and a half now since I've had one.
I had to go out of my way to avoid any scenarios that trigger me wanting to smoke. I don't go around smokers or places, even my own parents, if there's a possibility of being exposed to it, especially in an enclosed area. They have to do it outside, out of sight, out of smell-range or I can't be around it. Yes some find it offensive but you have to take responsibility for your own health. It's sucks sometimes because I feel like an ass but it has helped me tremendously and I won't let anything ruin my progress. 
The worst part is the smell thing. You don't realize it while you're a smoker you, your clothes, your things, all *reek* of smoke (even if you think you don't, you do), so you don't notice it in your vicinity much. When you quit and that tolerance to it wears off, you can smell the slightest hint of it a mile away. 
That in itself has been the biggest motivator for me to stay off of cigarettes. I never realized how bad I smelled and now I can tell how bad others smell. I don't want to be like that again. "
"I'm not a smoker, nor do I have any kids, but a friend of mine quit a little over a year ago and I suggested that when the urge started to become overwhelming, he should stop and picture his 7yo daughter lighting one up. He said that actually helped a few times.
Much more so than our other friend who kept trying to stop and I offered to put my dick in his mouth instead."
At same time started using J. Crows Iodine could have helped. I had stopped smoking before and never last more then five days had been smoking for almost ten years. Also my father always said don't say quit just say stop because you should never fully quit something you like. He stopped smoking regular when he was around 30 and has had maybe a pack total in 30 years since. I have stopped since October and some days still crave but if you do one healthy thing a day it goes away and takes your mind off it.
"The easiest way I found to quit was to stop the smoke breaks and stop wanting that social part of smoking. It literally took me changing jobs from a place where I smoked to somewhere no one smoked for it to be consistent.
 I smoked for close to 15 years and quit a hundred times. This was the first time it stuck for more than a year. 
"
I didn't quit .. I smoke like a moron... 
"I just stopped. I found myself enjoying the time away from my desk moreso than the actual smoking, so I still take 'smoke breaks' - I get up, walk around outside for a couple minutes, and come back in. Works great!
Also, my lady absolutely HATED the smell and taste of kissing a smoker so I quit for her.
My mom quit because my 8 year old told her that she was going to die if she kept smoking."
"Allen Carr's book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"".  I was really skeptical, but I couldn't recommend it more highly to anyone who is even remotely interested in quitting.  It's not very expensive (about what a pack of cigarettes costs where i live) and may change your life like it did for me, so you have nothing to lose by reading it."
"I used Chantix, But I will say use it with caution..... It caused weird side affects.
Hardest thing for me was figuring out how to relax, I guess i used it (smoking) to relax and didn't realize it.
Been 7 years now. Still have to tell myself, I don't need it...."
Spontaneous cold turkey. Also... my motivation was I was told I had bad smokers breath. Do I actually get women now that I don't smoke? No.... :(
"* Chantix.  
The drug doesn't work for everyone, but I kept smoking for two weeks after I started the medication, then ciggies just started tasting bad.  I kept smoking less and less because I got nothing out of it.  After 20 years of trying to quit, it worked beautifully.  Doesn't work as well for some of my friends, but if you keep taking the drug on schedule, you are going to lose all the joy of smoking, which makes it amazingly easy to not pick up another cig - there's no fun in it."
"E-Cigarettes. I loved Logic but Blu is another amazing brand. What it lacks in simulating the EXACT feeling of smoking a cigarette is makes up for in usability. You will probably start off smoking more than normal with E-Cigs because you can use them indoors. The best part though, which is what heavily reduced my smoking was that when I was walking to the car, instead of lighting up a cig and then having to smoke the whole thing, I could just take a few puffs and be satisfied.
Eventually you can move to non-nicotine E-cigs. I personally still love the act of smoking and grab an E-Cig every now and then for a night out of drinking or a gaming marathon."
"We'll I know this gets a lot of criticism but I did NLP ( hypnotherapy ), it was one of the 60minute quit smoking sessions. It worked amazingly for me, my cravings changed from nicotine to going to the gym, eating healthy and loving life. I had some custom programming that I would accept better than their generic program. Since quitting at Christmas I have lost 8kg and have not smoked since."
got serious about rugby again.  my advice would be cold turkey plus exercise.  you can really feel the difference when you're running.
"Mine was financial, Once they hit 3 bucks a pack I walked away, the first month or so after that really sucked.  The first week or so I still hung out in smoking areas getting the traces of a second hand effect, but after the first week I didn't feel I needed it anymore."
"The only way you will be successful at quitting is if you have an ACTUAL reason, not all the health bullshit they try to shove down your throat.
MY wife asked me to quit smoking the day we got married because she didn't want me to die young, so I said yes and had my last cigarette the day of my wedding. If she hadn't asked me to quit I would still smoke today.
Find a reason to quit."
"It sounds ridiculous, but one day I realised ""I'm actually going to die some day"", totally freaked out and decided I wanted to live a long and healthy life. Smoking was no longer an option. "
"It's had to stop doing something we enjoy. But it's easy to stop doing something we hate. The key is to make yourself hate smoking. 
Here what I did: Every time I lit a cigarette, I talked non-stop about how gross it was and how much I hated it. It didn't matter wether or not it was true. Whenever I saw someone else smoking, I made a point to say (to myself) how bad their their cigarette smelled. Again, it didn't matter if it was true. 
The funny thing is, eventually is *was* true. One day I realized that although i looked forward to the ""event"" of lighting up, I had really grown to hate smoking, and I definitely hated the way it made me feel. Once I made my mind up that I hated it, everything changed. It was no longer about *giving up something I loved.* It was about *not doing something I hated.* Big difference. 
The social aspect wasn't easy at first, and there were times that I missed the comfort of simply holding a cigarette while talking to people. So, I started blowing bubbles. When everyone else lit a cigarette, I got out my bubbles. It was surprisingly soothing. I got to hold something in my hand, I got the calming effects of a deep inhale and exhale, plus got to watch the bubbles, the same way I was used to watch the smoke. It was everything I loved about smoking, and nothing I hated. Eventually I ran out of bubbles but by that time I was over the hump and I really didn't need them anymore. 
**TL;DR: program yourself to hate smoking and replace your cigarettes with bubbles!**
"
"I just quit cold turkey after 4 years and the first two weeks were hell, but after that it gets A LOT better. You actually feel so much healthier, so when you can actually feel the difference in your body it will help you not want to smoke. A great support system helped me a lot too, I quit with a group friends so having other people to go through it with you makes it bearable. Stick in there and don't give up, you'll feel so much better about yourself if you set a huge goal like this and achieve it!"
"I also work in an industry where your 'breaks' are just to run outside, haul a smoke back and get back in to work (restaurant). I get how shitty that is, but I wouldn't call it a trigger.
My advice is never say you're quitting, which sounds ridiculous. It sets yourself up for more of a defeat if you fail (which, lets admit, happens). If you say ""I quit"" and then go back 3 days later, you're just going to feel like shit. Tell yourself you're going to make a conscious effort to smoke less, and smoke less. That way if you slip up and have an extra smoke or two from a stressful day, no biggie, back on the smoking-less horse the next day. A lot of quitting smoking is a LOT of willpower.
I also kept a log in my phone of how many smokes I had in a day, when were the key moments of my day when I would want one (morning coffee, arrive at work, mid-day break, after dinner). I'd pick one of those that I thought i could go without and went without it. Eventually I weaned myself down to as few cigarettes I could get by on without murdering everyone and then switched to nicotine gum.
A little fun fact about nicotine gum though: The instructions suggest you chew a piece for 30 seconds and then park it on your gums for up to half an hour. This, in my mind, is a bit ridiculous. You wouldn't slooooowwly smoke a cigarette for half an hour, giving your body a more regular stream of nicotine. I usually just bit a piece in half, chewed it until the nicotine deprivation rage went away, spat it out and chugged a glass of water.
All the best luck to you, 5 times quitting is better than no times quitting. Keep at it.
"
I started dipping. And to quick dipping I swallowed the dip. 
After years of smoking I switched to an e-cig cold turkey about 6 months ago. I'm almost to the no nicotine fluid and I haven't had a cigarette since. 
"Stop buying cigarettes
I'm not being flippant or trolling or trying to make a cynical joke. I've smoked since I was a teenager and have quit and relapsed multiple times.
Trust me, just stop buying cigarettes. Don't have them in a house, car, anywhere. Dont accept them from anyone, dont even touch them, dont buy them for someone else, dont go out with your smoker friends when they have one. 
Stop blaming cigarettes for your decision to smoke cigarettes. It is always your decision and you make it every time you light up. If you really don't want to smoke, then just don't. Get into that mindset, it is the only way. 
Dont use gum, pills, acupuncture, prayer, meditation, crystals, or anything else to help you. That makes it less your decision and you give up your power.
Do it cold turkey, Make the decision and stick too it. Accept that it is your decision wholeheartedly, and just stop. 
If you do not have the will power to do it, you won't. "
"I took three days off work (well, I called in sick) and spent three days solid with my wife, then girlfriend, to help her stay honest. She had been smoking for something like 20 years at that point.
It was fairly tough for her so I had to keep her busy, but there's only so much you can do. At one point I was laying on the couch reading while she was working on her computer and she turned to me and screamed, ""HOW CAN YOU JUST LAY THERE DOING NOTHING? DO SOMETHING!"" LOL. Marriage protip: You REALLY get to know someone when they are under immense stress.
Anyway, getting over those first three days is what did it...the worst of the cravings had passed and, although the next few weeks were tough (she ALMOST bought a pack of herbal cigarettes once) she quit and has been smoke free for over a decade."
"I don't recommend it, but being worked over by paramedics at your job because you think you might be having a heart attack is pretty effective.  As it turned out, I was having a (rather severe) anxiety attack, but having never experienced either before, I had nothing to go on except the sensation of my heart racing and thumping against my ribs so forcefully that the possibility that it might just stop seemed totally plausible at the time.  "
Tonsillitis ...
Pregnancy.
"I have used Blu e-cigs as well as Nicorrette gum. With the gum-chew as directed. Once every hour. Chew and store in gums for 30 minutes.
Really you can quit any way you want. The key is that you really have to want it. Too many people try to quit because they know it's bad rather than really wanting to make an improvement in their lives."
"I tried gum and patches, but in the end it was cold turkey that worked for me. Also, when I went cold turkey, I really wanted to quit.... 100% didn't want to smoke anymore, the smell, the cost... Everything about it repulsed me. 
Try eating the contents of an ashtray, that way whenever you smoke that's all you'll be able to think about! "
Time traveling robot sent back in time to change my future.
"Lazyness. I stopped years ago when the Southern US was going through about 30+ days of 98-100+ degree days and towns were running out of water.  Like, more than 1 or 2, dozens upon dozens were running out.  Well, I had a rule that I'd not smoke in my house and make it smell like a bar which meant going out on my back deck.
Well, it was 100 degrees on a good day and it was more like 110 (feeling like 117-120) most days.  I just refused to go outside in the extreme heat to inhale hot smoke.  Then it went from that to very cold.  Like, VERY cold.  I refused to go outside and freeze my nuts off.  After that, I had quit for nearly a year so I figured why not just keep the ball rolling.  And I did."
Surprised no one has suggested e-cigarettes and yet. Worked for me. 
"I quit 8 years ago after smoking a pack a day for 15 years. I used the lozenges (Sp?) for the nicotine fits but I think it was my son tat made it stick. At the time he was almost 2 starting to really get into shit. He was wearing me out and losing my breath while playing with him was bumming me out. So I'm sure others will say this but you have to really want to quit I think.
 8 years later I still want one, but our lifestyle wont allow it. I like being able to be active and having shitty lungs really doesn't allow it. Good Luck man!!"
"I think this varies from person to person based on how addictive your personality is, but what worked for me was cold turkey.  I was a smoker for 10 year and made the decision that it was time to cut that shit out.  It was very difficult for me, but I made the mental decision to stop.  I picked a date, let my friends & fam know, then just did it.  I was the biggest asshole to all my friends for a good month & a half.  Worst mood swings I've ever experienced in my life.  But it's been well worth it.  I'm now 3.5 years a non-smoker.  I think you need get your mind prepared for quitting, know that it is going to suck but that the light on the other side is wonderful & well worth it, and stick to you.  You'll need friends and family to help support you.  If you have friends that still smoke in front of you, don't hang out with them until you are ok being in the presence of cigarette smoke.  Keep at it!  Stay mentally strong and you can do it!"
An e-cigarette and Wellbutrin. 
"I used an electronic cigarette.  It did nothing for me until I actually started treating it as if it were the real thing.  I wouldn't smoke it in the house and would take smoke breaks at work.  I slowly weened myself down by decreasing my amount of nicotine intake.  
I've been off of nicotine entirely for three years now and would not have been able to do it without the e-cig.  As an added bonus... I worked at a tobacco shop while quitting and was still able to do it, you can too!  "
I quit several times but the last time (smoke free since may 2010) was because I was either going to have to stop or buy smokes for my son.  It was the aversion to having my kids grow up to be smokers.
"You quit smoking.  It is not that hard, and if you are looking for a ""magic cure"" you won't find it.
It is really, really simple.  Stop buying cigarettes.  Stop smoking them.  BAM, eventually you will be over it.  If you can't do that, you have a psychological issue and you are weak willed.  You will feel like shit while you are trying to quit, there is no way around that."
"I quit cold turkey for my then-girlfriend, now wife.  I've been wanting to quit for a while and she gave me the kick in the ass I needed to actually do it.
I quit cold turkey, bought a few video games, and just plowed through them to keep my mind off things.  Keeping myself occupied helped me through the first week, and after that, it was easier.
That was almost 2 years ago...I still have the occasional craving, but its easy to just shrug it off.  I'm in better shape and never felt better.  I play hockey and have run a half-marathon and am training to run a full marathon this November.
TL;DR: Find something to keep yourself occupied and good luck."
Snus
"I started by switching to e-cigs since I really just wanted to get away from tobacco. Whether or not that helped I'm not sure, but I eventually dropped them as well in order to quit entirely.
Withdrawal for me felt a little like the flu, so I would treat myself as sick and just play games, eat a shit-tonne of take-away, junk food, etc. 
I took a break from hanging around my smoker friends for about a week then would hang around them again normally, drinking and watching movies, but would use an Nicorette inhaler instead of smoking (and sparingly!). 
Eventually the feeling of withdrawal (hot flushed and dizzy) felt like its own kind of rush/high and I started to enjoy not smoking more than smoking. The rest was just fighting the boredom and getting used to doing things without smoking.
There are fact sheets online that are a kind of timeline of how much healthier you are since quitting. 10 mins, an hour, a day, a year, etc. I found that really helpful to look at (I still do).
Good luck!
Edit: Haven't smoked in about 3 years. I wish my friends would quit too though, it's still tempting when drunk."
"You need to really want to quit. You won't get anywhere if you half-ass it and don't take it seriously. Even so, it took me a few tries before I was able to quit for good. "
"My dad was a pack and a half a day smoker. He went Snowboarding in Whitefish on a cloudy day (ALWAYS go on a clear day). His board caught an edge, threw him off a 5 foot ledge, broke 4 ribs. When he got home, he was bed ridden because he also contracted pneumonia. Every time he got up to smoke a cigarette it hurt him and he almost couldn't breath. After his numerous attempts to finish ONE cigarette he finally said ""fuck it.""
So you could always break your ribs and get pneumonia.  As far as I know it's worked 100% of the time 1 out of 1 times."
E-Cigs.  A local retailer is awesome and will slowly lower your dose until you hit 0% and then he lets you know.  After that point I stopped using E-cigs all together and now I can go to a bar and not break down and have to have a smoke.
"My mother quit cold turkey and hasn't smoked in about a year and my father quit using an ecig (vaporshark) and he hasn't smoked in 4 months. Both my parents had smoked for 25+ years. Different methods work for different people, but it's definitely a tough habit to get rid of, and I commend all those who manage to quit. "
Lent. Really. Cold turkey.
moved to america..american cigs are nasty 
Waiting until I actually wanted to quit. 
"Well will power is key, for me it was an upcoming trip to the Andes. I didn't want to be that person at the hotel on Oxygen and wheezing  because the air is thinner up there, I wanted to be able to go hiking with my friends. Not that guy who holds back the progress.
I went to the doctor and he prescribed Chantix, back then there wasn't much on the adverse side effects. I was one of the first few hundreds or thousands of people that were asked to report side effects directly to health care officials.  
I took the drug for 2 months, and it worked. I smoked for the first few weeks but after that my desire for smoking really did disappear. Though the side effects made me quit taking Chantix, they were also severe. So technically I never finished the entire course of meds recommended. But it worked and every time I thought I wanted to smoke, instead I used Altoids (mints) to get through the stressful parts of my day. Admittedly I did have a mint problem for awhile, but now I'm smoke free for several years and only an occasional mint abuser. "
"My wife quit cold turkey after she moved from Alabama (~$3.25 a pack) to Chicago (~$10.50 a pack) and couldn't afford it anymore. She got on Wellbutrin to help with the emotions of quitting, which luckily is ""free"" with my insurance. She hasn't smoked in about 18 months now."
"Fear. Had a pneumonia and a talk with a doctor. It wasn't anything too serious, however it put me in a very long-term state of mind.
One week later, after some mental preparation and convincing a few of my friends to also quit, I went cold turkey. All my friends started again after 2 weeks - 1 month, most likely because they hadn't gone through the same process.
Going on 7 years now without a smoke and I really do not feel any temptation to try it again. I actually can't stand 2nd hand smoke now.
As some advice, you really need to not make a big deal out of it. Yes, it is a form of addiction, however a very mild one. You can stop if you just decide that you will stop."
"I smoked regularly through college. I quit when I moved to a new town after college and started a job that gave me a lot of time for outdoor recreation and paid poverty-level wages. I had new friends who didn't smoke as much, and I was able to indulge my love of hobbies that kicked my ass if I smoked.
So, I guess I'm saying that I did it at the same time I was making some pretty meaningful lifestyle changes. Maybe it would help you to take up a new sport or join a new club at the same time? Is there a local indoor rock climbing gym?  Your local hash house harriers chapter? Maybe you can hit the gym or go for a run during your lunch break at work?
Getting a good, hard workout in was helpful for me for two reasons. First, I was able to blow off steam and relieve stress. Second, it punished me if I bummed one while I was out at the bar the night before! I could feel the damage I had done if I backslid.
And those e-cigarettes are junk: it's just more nicotine!"
"Self-control doesn't have to be about willpower, it can be about structuring your environment so that you don't have to constantly make the choice to ""be good."" I've never quit smoking, but I've quit lots of other bad habits. This approach is pretty flexible.
1) Try to go cold turkey. The aim is not necessarily to quit (though if you do, bonus!), it's to collect data about your triggers for your vice.
2) Write that shit down. Keep a notepad with you. Make a few notes about your mood, location, company, intensity of craving, etc. If you end up having a cigarette, no biggie.
3) At the end of the week (possibly longer for habits less frequent than smoking), try to categorize the data. Separate out actual triggers from ""just because"" moments. At a general level, your top 2-3 triggers will probably account for 75-90% of your habit.
4) The tricky part: figure out how to restructure the trigger environments to discourage or disallow the vice. Usually, it has to be something more powerful than just not having access. Maybe your main triggers all occur at work. Tell your closest work friend that you're trying to quit and give them your cigarettes. You'll still have access, but you'll have to ask your friend and face the fact that you're actively *choosing* to smoke. This is how you start to break the stimulus-response link, by forcing you to make and active choice every time.
5) Remember that it's not about having done well, it's about doing a little bit better next time. Some days are going to be bad, but tomorrow always has the potential to be better.
Best of luck!"
"I got yet another head cold, when I would've rather dug out my eyeballs with a spoon than smoke a cigarette. That made it easier. After that I made a conscious decision to not smoke anymore. I told myself each time I wanted one to just wait a day, and if I really wanted one I could have one ""tomorrow."" It's been about 4 years now."
"Radiation treatments to my abdomen for testicular cancer. Zapped 15 seconds a side, then went home & vomited for hours. Unlike when drunk, I didn't feel better after puking. Killed any nicotine cravings & I've  been clean 11 years. "
"I went cold turkey, the 1st january 2014, havent smoked since even though i live with a smoker."
"Got the flu, didn't smoke for four days. Decided I didn't have to start smoking again, and just quit. After this it just takes resolve and willpower. Worked for me!"
"A potential solution - don't have cigs on you and make the deal that you will have to pay anybody 100 dollars if you attempt to bum a cig from them (or a kick in the nuts, whichever motivates you the most)."
"I stopped when I got serious about exercise and playing sports, trying to catch your breath and hack gray and black phlegm out if your lungs sucks."
"You say you have an e-cig, but what level of nicotine are you using? Start off high and wean yourself down to lower concentrations. 
Also, plug for /r/electronic_cigarette great community to help kick the habit"
"You have to want it, and to want it you have to believe a) just how awful it is for you and b) just how much better off you'll be without. Make a list to the pros (""I like it!"") and cons (""No one has *ever* enjoyed emphysema"") and be honest. The pros list should be embarrassingly short.       
Once you've been convinced (if you aren't already), man/woman the fuck up and just *do* it. Lots of things are hard. Life is hard. But there is nothing so rewarding as facing down a challenge and coming out scarred but victorious. I know, I know: you *want* one, it'll feel so good, you'll be grumpy & gain weight without. Your brain is a cruel motherfucker to be party to that shit, you just need to persevere and get over it. after a few days it isn;t even chemical dependency anymore, it's just (with all due respect) you being a bitch. You're better than a mere *cigarette* right?       
The increased chance of cancer, of having bits of your mouth or throat or lungs carved away, forever from your body, disfiguring you; the unimaginable pain, that breathing is now a hellish experience, a million fires in your chest with every gasp; the loss & pain the people around you will feel when youre gone, asking themselves ""Why couldn't barbiesarthritis just *listen* when I begged him/her to stop"". *That*, my friend, will be real pain & struggle. Just tossing the pack & never looking...er...back? A minor blip. It's not impossibe, just try. Hard. Harder than you've ever tried anything. You really can do it, now, without regret. Chewing gum (NOT nicorette), fidgety hand activities (pen twirling, cards, drawing, whatever), food, any & all distractions are fair game. *Do something else*. ANYthing else. Make a deal, ask someone to hold you to it. Make it reprehensible, something morally vile to you: ""If I every have another smoke, I have to do it while raping an alterboy"" or ""For each cigarette I have from now on, I have to donate $50 to the KKK"". Mean it. Give yourself a real, horrible, right-now consequence and picture yourself having to do this thing. For me it's a promise to ask a relative for a handjob. No one wants that. Whether or not I'd follow through, it weighs on me: ""If I smoke, I have to do this horrible *thing*"".      
Anyway. That's how I quit. I refused to buy myself a new pack, and a day later, while the inside of my head was *SCREAMING* at me, pissed, just horrid, I tapped my feet and relaxed and just refused to go get a new one. I was in a foul mood. But it passed. Everything does. The want will come back, while drinking, while other friends are smoking, just out of the blue. I just have to remember to suck it up. I don't need that shit.       
"
Shisha pens :P
I broke my foot and was more or less immobile for weeks other than to bathe. Had no choice but to quit. 
"I tried quitting many times unsuccessfully.
one night, I got hammered. like, high school blackout wasted. woke up with probably one of the worse hangovers I have ever had. thought I wanted a smoke, but I didn't. decided I would try to force myself to smoke. was probably the worst thing I have ever done to myself in my life. it made me feel much worse, puked all day. the thought of smoking made me feel awful.
that was day one. that was 8 years ago."
I Haven't had a smoke since Sunday. I just woke up and decided I wanted to smell and taste again. Cold turkey. Besides running and working out I've just been hiding in my house to get through this first week. Will power Mayne.
"Quit cold turkey. Substitute in marijuana.
Don't use e-cigs/hookahs..they get you more addicted. My friend went from smoking like 10 cigs a day to his e-cig and then he lost it and now smokes a pack a day due to the amount of nicotine the e-cig was giving him."
"My friend and I had both had it with smoking around the same time, so we each set a date and drew up contracts that said that if either of us ever smoked again after that day, the other guy had his permission to beat the living shit out of him, within reason. It started off as kind of a drunken joke, but it did the trick. We were both ready to quit anyway, but this was the thing we needed to get over those, ""Meh, why not?""-type cravings."
"I read Alan Carr's ""The Only Way To Quit Smoking"" and although it is a bit gimmicky, it did get me prepared to quit.  I was able to quit cold turkey after reading this book.  I had smoked for more than ten years."
"This will get buried but I think it's important any way. 
I was able to quit because it was what I wanted. I didn't want to smoke anymore. I didn't want to be a smoker. I found out I was pregnant and I didn't want to be that mother. I wanted to be healthy and set a good example and do everything I could to make sure my baby was healthy. 
I had been smoking fairly heavily for about four years when I quit. I have never regretted it. I do occasionally have cravings still but I know that they're not worth it. Being the person I want to be is worth ignoring the cravings. "
"I had success with the e-cigs.  I actually enjoy the e-cigs more to be honest as I actually get a buzz from them.
"
I don't know exactly how I quit I just sort of stopped smoking cigarettes. I can't pin point a date I quit. I went from a pack every 2 days my senior year of college to not buying packs anymore and bumming to I don't smoke anymore over the course of a year and half.
"I started smoking around 14-15. By 17 i was smoking a pack a day. I did that until i turned 30, which is when i decided i would quit smoking. Turns out i had one cigarette after that in a moment of weakness. No biggie. My problem is that i decided i could smoke cigars when drinking. I started inhaling just a little smoke. Cut to a couple years later and i'm smoking cigars everyday and inhaling more than just a little. Fuck me i'm now 35ish and still addicted to nicotine. Then one drunken night i want to smoke a cigar but the combination of the crappy swisher sweet smoke along with drunkenness causes me to hiccup every time i try to take a drag. I'm so addicted that i'm trying to fight through my bodies' natural revulsion to the poison just so i can satiate that urge. 
It didn't dawn on my right away that i had quit. I just knew i hated that feeling of wanting/needing nicotine and not being able to get my fix. So that's how i quit. I didn't plan it. Even after i quit i didn't know i had quit. I just had a depressing humbling moment brought on by addiction that was so distasteful to me that i haven't gone back. 14 months nicotine free. "
My bank card card got compromised which led to me being able to spend far less. If I wanted to smoke I'd have to go all the way to the bank and withdraw cash. Fuck that. Three days later I'm a non smoker. 
"Never quit with another addiction, candy, soda,.etc. Never be without water. Like most substances it's water soluble, meaning it bonds well with water. The more water cycles through the lower the substance concentration. Every tick answered with a swig and it'll feel like an awakening."
"Get a **good** electronic cig. I smoked a pack a day, then a shop specializing in e-cigs opened less than a mile from my house. I went in a got a little $50 kit. While it did reduce my cigs/day, I still didn't get that ""hit"" like a real cig. Then I got an opportunity to get a $200 unit at a deal, and I switched to a very nice e-cig (Joyetech eVic) and the difference was like the difference in smoking Pyramids vs. Marlboros. I have since switched again to a mechanical mod (Smok Magneto) with a Russian 91% tank, and it's even better. I have completely quit regular cigs, and have gone from 18mg nicotine down to 6mg nicotine in my juice."
"Chantix. It took me three attempts because the first two times I didn't really want to and was being forced by my dad (said he'd pay for my schooling if I quit). 
My third go at it was this August and it's because I really wanted to stop. I am just turned 29, I was beginning to see signs of aging, it's not cool anymore, all my friends quit, it's expensive, and I was so fucking *tired* of it *controlling* my life and thoughts. Every day was ""Do I have enough for the night, or should I stop at the mart on the way home/to work/before going to x event"". It's goddamned exhausting. 
Now, I am free and it's amazing. Six months in February. Never again. "
"Cold turkey worked for me as well.  
However, for about 3 months to a year after you have to watch out for that moment of weakness.
I had one when I had just quit for 3 months and I was drinking with a friend I've not seen for a long time.  He lit up a cigarette and I was very drunk and reached for the box.  My other close friend who knew that I had quit called me a pussy and made me have second thoughts about lighting it.  I credit him to this day for helping me quit for life.
It's been almost 10 years since, I recently lit one while I was drunk and I felt dizzy and nauseous so I'm done with it. "
"I pray it is not too late to see this. I swear by Allen Carr's EasyWay to quit smoking. Despite what you think quitting smoking really doesn't have to be a negative experience, you don't have to miss it, it's about getting you're head around the fact you aren't actually giving anything up. This book changed my life and yes, I was insanely skeptical to begin with. How could a book get me to quit when drugs failed? Please OP give this a try, PM me with your address and I will send you my copy. THIS SHIT WORKS."
"Personally, I was able to quit along with the help of an Oregon medical marijuana card, some really good cannabis, and a water pipe that was taller than I was.
  How I was able to *stay* quit was by never, ever smoking another cigarette. It sounds silly to say, but when you've quit for six months or a year, and you're tipsy at a party and folks are smoking, you really feel like you could smoke *just one* cigarette. You can't. You cannot smoke that one cigarette. I quit smoking for a year at a time FOUR times, and relapsed because I smoked a cigarette ""just this once."" Now I've gone a little over three years with no tobacco at all. And I feel great. I don't get sick nearly as often as I used to, and running and biking isn't exhausting. But I've wanted a cigarette every day for three years. They smell gross to me, but I still want them and I just don't let myself."
"Tried for several yrs to quit. The last time, I thought about it for weeks and finally one Sunday nite I was sitting on my bed about to turn in. As I stubbed out my cig I said ""That's it, I'm done.""
I went to sleep and when I woke up I had no craving for a smoke and never have since. Don't know if it was self-hypnosis or what, I just never wanted one again. It's been many, many years.
For 15 yrs or so I would sometimes dream I started up again and be very disappointed in myself till I woke up."
"I happened to have a very easy time quitting. Smoked about 4 or 5 a day in the worst of it. One week I had the flu pretty bad, and when it was starting to go away I went out one night and ended up getting pretty drunk. The next day, I felt hungover as fuck but decided I really wanted a cigarette anyway so I thought, fuck it I'll have one. So I went outside and started smoking the cigarette and it immediately felt awful and disgusting but for some reason I toughed it out until about halfway through. Finally I thought, this is disgusting, why the hell am I even doing this? So I tossed the one I had and threw the rest in the trash. That memory of that disgusting cigarette made it really easy to quit, for me - haven't wanted one since then. Sorry that's not really advice - I guess you could just get sick, then drunk, then smoke one and see how it feels. 
Sidenote: I found out recently that [Paul McCartney had a similar experience quitting](http://youtu.be/jcYq3vtkITU?t=23m49s) - so I guess it's been effective for at least two people."
/r/stopsmoking and cold turkey
"I quit using e-cigs a week after my grandpa died from COPD/complications from pneumonia. He smoked for over fifty years, and in his last moments, he kept struggling to open his eyes like he didn't accept dying. My grandpa was basically a second father to me, and watching someone you love get ripped from the Earth was enough to make me seriously rethink everything in my life. It's a shame that it had to be something that drastic to make me make what seems like a straightforward decision.
Basically just don't think about yourself and think about what it'll do to your family. When I started to think about my grandpa and my dad (who smokes himself and is starting to develop breathing problems himself), it made smoking seem worthless. That's what helped me, at least, I wish you the best of luck, man."
"Also, I just noticed that you're in health care. Me too! Do what I did and get a job at your local cancer hospital, if you have one. After seeing about 50 people with stomas in your first week, smoking will start to lose its luster."
"I quit when I was 18. Started back up a year and a half later, but it worked.
I went to basic training (no tobacco permitted)."
"I quit 19 years ago this past New years eve after MANY attempts to do so. I had bronchitis and could barely breathe but was attempting to smoke anyway, I stepped outside myself for a moment and took a long unbiased look at my behavior. Why was I going to pay big bucks to kill myself? I had also just found out I was going to be a first time father and knew that I was only a smoker because both parents were. My children (all three are militant non smokers). Do it for the right reason and it is easy."
"Actually I just got really sick. Came down with a nasty sinus infection and felt so miserable I couldn't smoke. 
Once that cleared up I was done. No more desire at all. Hit one year on January 4th. 
Keep trying op. You'll get it. "
I became disgusted in myself and how bad I smelled and quit cold turkey.  
"Persistence. Never give up quitting, though it does get old, you will eventually make it. "
"The patch.  And Love.   I told myself that i want to love my partner for the rest of my life, and I need to do whatever I can do spend more time alive.   So that really helped me.
So of course two years later, we're broken up.  But even still, I would quit again now for the thought of love.  That my next love will get more of me. 
Its been over 2 years, and my mouth still sometimes waters thinking about the FEELINg of it, but the smell makes me sick.  "
"Zyban worked amazing for me! I was supposed to take it for 2 months but only needed the first 2 weeks, I didn't even finish my full prescription cause I don't like pills. It gives you that start that you need then willpower carries you the rest of the way, if you're ready"
"Cold turkey worked for me. I had worked up to 2 packs a day over 10 years. One day I just told myself I would never smoke another cigarette. The third day was the hardest. I went out to lunch with my husband and I got so angry for no reason. We went home and I was just sobbing on the couch. I got up and went for a long run - I had been a smokerrunner for a few years before this. I came back and still felt miserable without my cigarette but it seemed tolerable after the run.
By the 5th day my husband realized I was really going through with it and I'd be able to quit. He didn't want to be left behind still smoking when I had quit. He went out and bought patches and quit completely within a month.
There, two methods of quitting that worked. Just tell yourself you'll never smoke another cigarette again."
"I made quitting smoking into a drinking game. Since drinking is one of the most (and one of my most) common smoking triggers, I tested myself while out with friends (some who smoke) to see how many beers I could drink before I needed a cigarette. Eventually, I didn't need one, and not smoking in other situations became that much easier. "
"I used to do dipping tobacco on and off, and smoked regularly for quite a while. However I did not smoke 10+ years like some people. At one point I stopped smoking and started using dipping tobacco again. After a while, I could not stomach dipping anymore. From the taste to the grit, I got sick of it all. So I quit dipping cold turkey and don't use tobacco anymore. I will have a cigar once in a blue moon and I do miss having a nice pipe smoke, but those were more once-in-a-while activities than everyday habits."
"I'm kind of late to this, but maybe you'll end up seeing this so what the heck. While I haven't smoked myself, growing up my dad would go through at minimum a pack a day. He's been cigarette clean going on 8 years now.
One year we were going on a family vacation to Europe and it was after they changed the rules so you couldn't smoke on a plane. So he decided to quite a few months ahead of the trip because he didn't think he'd be able to handle a 6-7 hour trip without having a smoke.
He used the gum and that seemed to work for him. But as others said, having a big motivation was also probably a major factor."
"Every time I had a craving, I would think about how much better my throat would feel the following morning if I held off.  And the following morning, I would remember to be conscious of how much better my throat actually felt.  This repeated short-term reward loop worked.  I eventually started noticing how much better my fingers and clothes smelled without the reek of tobacco smoke."
"A trip to the ER with chest pains. Fear is the great motivator.
After that, a course of the patch, and when it looked like that wouldn't work, a course of prescription inhalers. Clean for four years now."
"Cold turkey is the only way to go. Everything else finds a replacement for the cigarette, so if you are without your replacement you will find the real thing.
My trick was this. I kept an open pack of smokes with me at all times during my quitting process which was a few weeks. I would just tell myself if I had a craving for a cigarette that I could have one later. When later would happen I'd tell myself the same thing again. We've all put off that next cigarette. In this case just keep putting it off. With the cigarettes on you, you know you're in control at all times. "
"Good Luck...I stopped smoking 10 years ago. I did this by allowing myself only one cigarette on an evening before bed for about 2-3 weeks. This gave me something to look forward to if I fancied a smoke but also reduced my nicotine addition.  If your trigger is work then don't tell work your stopping so you can still have the break but use the time to reflect and praise yourself on how strong your being.  You can do it!!
"
"Chantix, for me. Stopped in November 2008."
"Hasten to add, started at 14 (yeah, I know), stopped at 38. Tried 2 or 3 times to go cold turkey, and failed. Tried the Allen Carr method, that worked for a few months till I deliberately started again to piss off an ex-gf (yeah, I know).
Started Chantix while on a 2-pack-a-day habit. The Chantix gave me wicked flatulence and wacky, vivid dreams. Took it for 7-9 weeks after I last smoked, stopped when I felt I'd be okay. The nasty side-effects became public a while after I'd stopped taking it. 
I'm now one of those asshole ex-smokers who hates the smell of cigarette smoke.
/edit: typo"
"Cold Turkey.  Here's a few things that helped.
The first few weeks might be hard.  I removed all traces from the house--ashtray outside, lighters, etc.  I didn't drink alcohol.  I did eat whatever the Hell I wanted, and I'm typically pretty conscientious about that type of thing.  I kept in mind that I might be moody/tried to nip that type of thinking/attitude in the bud.  And I avoided people I used to smoke with for a time.  Good luck!"
"What worked for me was smoking so much and for so long that I just stopped liking it.
I smoked for 20 years and I quit cold turkey after quitting many times in the past.. I've quit like 15 times or so, all cold turkey. Sometimes I started again after a few days, weeks or months and once I started smoking again after a year. I always got back to the habit because I loved smoking. I was quitting because I knew it was bad for me but deep down I really enjoyed it so whenever I had an excuse I would go back.
Finally after 20 years one day I realized I had stopped enjoying my cigarettes as much and started feeling repulsed by the taste they left in my mouth every morning and how sick they made me feel every night I went out drinking. I smoked compulsively when I drank, I could smoke 4 packs in a night. I noticed that the cigarettes had a bigger effect on my hangovers than the whisky, beer, wine and champagne I combined the night before. So I quit again and this time I know I'm never going back.
I haven't puffed a single time for over a year now and I don't like smoking anymore but I still have cravings.. as time goes by the cravings get spaced out more and become weaker but every once in a while they remind me they are still there and maybe will be there forever. My father told me once a long time ago that he still had it occasionally 30 years after he quit so I expect it will be the same for me and it doesn't bother me much anymore... I got used to it."
"I smoked for about 20 years and what finally got me to stop was when my daughter asked me to quit.  What I did was go out an get me one of those e-cigs, I used it in place of the real thing.  I left it at work one Friday and said to hell with it and never looked back.  That was a year ago.  It took about a month of use before I got to that point."
Hypnosis. Gave me that extra willpower.
"not a smoker but I can tell you how my dad got over the smoking habit. he, too, failed the first few tries. he had used the patch, and he stopped hanging around with his buddies when they stepped out for a smoke break. each time he tried something new, he would easily revert back because of some extraneous circumstance - or so he says. he would blame stress, pressure, seeing other people smoke. 
BUT the one thing that finally gave him the angst to kick the habit for good was... having my little sister born. after reading articles on the affects of second hand smoking in conjunction with the effective commercials depicting holes in people's throats and windpipes after lung surgery - he threw it all away overnight. 
so OP.. what i'm saying is.. HAVE A CHILD. jk. find the right internal motivation for really getting over it. read some of the late medical articles. think about how long you want to live, or if you want kids some day. 
best of luck!"
Not me but my dad. He had smoked for quite a while and he smoked somewhere around a pack a day.  One night he was in his bedroom in his 2nd floor apartment. His roommate fell asleep on the couch with a lit cigarette.  It started a fire and his friend died. My dad had to jump off the balcony to escape the fire. From that point on he was done smoking.
"Quit twice. First time I isolated myself in a cabin in the woods, second time I just got an e- cig. Now I'm an e-cig addict, but I have my wind back and no more coughing. "
"Just pretend to smoke your e-cig and do not refill it. Quitting cold turkey will be hard but rewarding in the long run. Between the oral-fixation and nicotine addiction, find ways to keep your hands and mouth occupied besides eating. 
That's bogus that you cannot take a 5 minute break and smokers can. If HR has anything to say about it or wants to write you up, speak with the EEOC about their discrimination towards you as a non-smoker. Now, if you are taking 5 minutes breaks every 30 hour to ""smoke"", co-workers and HR might get pissy. Just use good judgement. 
[Vaping](http://www.livescience.com/41392-e-cigarettes-addicting-safer.html) can still hurt your lungs. My mother developed Hypoxia and COPD/emphysema from smoking after 37 years. I found out she was hiding an e-cig from me after explicitly explaining that if she doesn't stop smoking, she will die. Her lung capacity is now at 19%. It's sad to see her not being able to do much, hooked up to oxygen 24/7, and being sick constantly. My family and I really hope she will become a recipient for a lung transplant, so she can at least enjoy the last years of her life. Even then, I don't know how long she'll live afterwards. Losing your parent to something that could have been halted early on is horrifying. Constant pleas throughout my childhood and adulthood to get her to stop smoking only happened when she collapsed at work last year. 
Quit and find the willpower to get through the withdrawals safely. Patches and therapy do help to some extent to lessen the blow from withdrawals but be ready for some weird feelings of anger, pain, nausea, shakes/tremors, and depression. If you do not have the drive to quit, ask for professional and seek out family/friend help. Insurance plans sometimes have cessation workshops, discounted/free cessation tools, and plans. I wish you luck. Feel free to PM me if you want more information or just want to talk. :)"
Cold Turkey. Plus the heart attack and flat lining twice. I can take a hint.
"Cold turkey, but it probably wouldn't have happened if I hadn't almost died suffocating on a peanut.
It happened on the evening before my birthday in 2008. I had to spend a night at the hospital because of a resulting pharyngeal edema, but that was quite about it. I forgot about the whole story, and then around a month later, out of the blue, I was short of air and figured out I was about to die.
It was horrible, it lasted for quite some time, and I was convinced my lungs are ""shutting down"". It wasn't until a couple of hours later that I figured out it might be psychosomatic as I was still alive; and it wasn't until a couple of visits to doctors' offices that I became convinced about it: I was experiencing panic attacks. A psychologist friend of mine told me that it was probably my mind's reaction to the suffocating episode.
Not that all this awareness helps the issue. It's bad. It's horrible, a full blown panic attack is completely debilitating.
The rest of the story is relatively unimportant, it took me years to shake it off, but the thought of smoking cigarerettes was incompatible with this whole ordeal in my mind from the very first minute. I can't do that to my lung, so I essentially became a non-smoker overnight.
That's not to say I didn't have any physical craving, but now I know that those cease after 2 days. Everything else is in your mind.
The change was so drastic, that after a week I started actually perceiving what cigarette smoke actually smells like, something I hadn't felt for the 14 years of smoking before, and I found it so repulsive that I had to leave smoky establishments every 15 minutes to get some fresh air.
Clean since October 2008, trying to avoid smoky places, which is unfortunately very difficult in Germany."
"My dad died from smoking-related illness. I quit cold turkey. Lots of chewing gum helped. Sleep, too."
Chantix was a godsend. Plus the dreams fucking ruled.  6.5 years smoke free after almost 20 years of smoking
"Smoked a pack a day for 17 years. Did it cold turkey a year and 10 days ago. What helped me is understanding what is happening to your body as you go through the process. For example, keep a little bottle of juice to keep your blood sugar up when you get a craving. 
[This guy](http://whyquit.com/)'s advice helped. ""Don't lock yourself up... Everything you do as a smoker you can do as a non-smoker... Many people before you have shown that it is possible..."" Etc. I watched that video every day for the first four days for support.
"
"I had been wanting to quit smoking for a long, long time. I hated the taste, the smell, the shame of buying another pack. I constantly reminded myself of how embarrassed I was about smoking. I would force myself to look at other smokers and notice yellow teeth, wrinkled skin, that clinging ashtray smell, the yellowed fingernails, the receding gums. I was scared to quit because I was scared I'd fail again, but more so scared that I would actually succeed. I'd smoked since college, coming to depend on smoking both socially and as stress relief. Twelve years later, I was working in the restaurant business and knew that I couldn't just continue to float along with the subculture norm of my career: hectic, stressful hours and the chemically-based responses to them.
So I didn't quit. I told myself that I wasn't quitting, that I was just putting off buying a new pack. I informed all of my coworkers that I wasn't smoking at work anymore. I explained to friends that I wasn't stepping out for a smoke during happy hour. It sounds silly, but it worked for me. I was able to ""put off"" smoking so much easier than ""quitting."" It was easier to control cravings, easier to see the upside of not smoking since I was experiencing it. After the first week, my routines were reestablished without cigarettes and it was less a glaring loss. It was easier to fight cravings because I knew that five minutes later, it would pass.
I haven't smoked since September 21, 2012. "
I finally quit when my son was born.  I was out with a friend and smoked.  First of all it suddenly tasted awful to me.  Then when I got home I didn't want to hold my infant son while my hands smelled like smoke.  That was over 5 years ago.  I haven't smoked since and have had zero desire to.
"I did a ten day Vipassana retreat on which tobacco products aren't allowed.
Kicked my habit, cold turkey, in there."
I decided that it was time for me to quit smoking.  Nothing will work if you aren't ready to quit.
"Feeling Ill and tired all the time and not wanting to smoke anymore.
Smoked for 17 years. Quit cold turkey. You REALLY have to want to stop."
Fuck. All this talk about quitting makes me really want a cigarette.
It makes me happy I'm not controlled by tobacco anymore. 
"I plan on quitting cold turkey on my dads birthday, March 30th. I got excited to see this thread, but I hope these next two months arn't too quick. You got this dude, nothing compares to inner will power, make a promise to yourself and own it. I'll be right there with you soon enough."
Cold Turkey coupled with an app that tells me how much money I'm saving by not smoking. It's a good bit of money.
ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES!!!!!!!!!
Being unemployed didn't hurt
"Hate, I hated those damn cigarettes. I started smoking when I was 14 and I just couldnt stop. First time I tried I was 21 but when your brothers and Dad smoked it was just difficult to quit, I lasted a month. 
Then 10 years later I woke up from a heavy night of drinking and coughed up blood I knew that it was time to stop. 
I started with E-cigs for about 2 months which kind of helped since im not really taking tobacco in. Then I went to Vegas and stupidly left my E-cig in my pocket when I went to the pool, fucker got wet. I could not find a replacement anywhere. Then I asked for my brother for a real cigarette I puffed on it and it was fucking VILE. I threw that shit away.
After that I haven't smoked in 2 years.
Now my Dad is trying to quit and my Mom keeps asking me for advice and I tell her that the only way he will quit is if he wants too. If he doesn't he wont."
"The reasons people smoke is complex. So there is no (one size fits all) solution.
What I did was face why I smoked..then optimized how I got my nicotine..
Smoking -> SNUS -> E-CIG  did that for about a year.. then dropped the nicotine and *poof* off nicotine forever!
"
"My dad was a smoker for 30+ years. He got his gallbladder taken out for something unrelated to smoking. After the surgery he said, ""I feel so shitty I can't even smoke."" So he stopped smoking. It's been about five years now since he's had a cigarette. 
I think the best way to quit is cold turkey. You just have to have the willpower and you can do it."
What kind of e-cig do you have? How often and why do you still smoke real cigs when you have your e-cig? Having the right one for your needs makes all the difference.
"My Dad used hypnosis back in the late 80s. He had tried cold turkey and the available gums and such at the time without any luck. It wasn't hypnosis like the cartoons where he magically didn't want to smoke anymore. He said that it helped him get past the cravings, but he still felt the urge to smoke because of old habit. "
"I put out a cigarette one New Years eve and realised I hadn't enjoyed smoking it, so I didn't smoke anymore. That was 3 years ago."
"I was on the nicotine patch (14 mg if I recall correctly). It wasn't working. I would tear the patch off and light up.  While on the patch, I hurt my back and had to see a doctor. We prescribed me Wellbutrin for my muscle pain. The Wellbutrin along with the 14mg patch eliminated my cravings within a day or two and I haven't smoked since. "
"Ecig. I've decreased my nicotine from 12mg to 6mg. My vape tastes like the first bite of a waffle that has vanilla and maple syrup on it. My office and room smell like I've been eating waffles. It's really the best. And to those who said I haven't quit, fuck off. That's like saying people chewing the gum haven't quit or people on the patch haven't quit. I haven't been combusting analogs so that's quitting in my eyes."
I signed up to run the NYC marathon and by the time I had reached the 16 mile run part of my training I just looked at my last cig and said WTF am I doing.  Cold turkey is the way to go
"E cig all the way. Started w 36 mg nicotine juice, currently down to 18mg, have tried real cigarettes since but the taste and smell makes me feel sick now. The 36mg e juice was the only thing I'd tried that satisfied a nicotine craving at the time "
"My friends took me to their house for 4 days. I had zero access to cigarettes, no bank cards, no cash, etc.... 
Four smokeless days later, I had zero desire to start up again. That was July 13, 1999. "
"Patches for 2 weeks to stop the physical habit of having a smoke with coffee/tea or after food. Then just pure will power.
I failed maybe 3 - 5 times before I got over them.
My advice, go for it, if you fail do not give up, try and try again.
You will have cravings for 6 - 12 months after and it wont be easy but you can do it.
DO NOT HAVE A PACK IN THE CUPBOARD JUST IN CASE.
Also: I found it helped to rip my last full pack up and throw them in the bin, after I smoked one out of the pack.
Get active, your body is goingto tell you that you are hungry but it is nicotine craving, Drink ALOT of water. Do not care if you put on a few kilos, just go for a walk or do something when you want a smoke. I did situps and pushups when I wanted a smoke.
It is hard, but you can do it."
"I just quit. thats it simple. And if I had one, then I quit again. And when I had one, i quit again. Soon the intervals became weeks and months, now its been 7 years.
To me the biggest things are
1) don't get down on yourself if you backslide. Just throw out the rest of the pack and go again.
2) if you MUST have 1, have 1.
3) Keep quitting
good luck"
"Promised my new gf at the time I'd quit. Bi didn't of course, but I did cut way back.  Eventually I just found myself not smoking.  So I guess it was gradual weaning combined with a really great woman."
E Cigarettes are the only thing that ever helped me.  
"First and foremost you must make the decision for your self that you want to quit, not quitting for someone or something else it has to be your decision. Then patches worked for me!"
/r/stopsmoking could help too. Motivates you loads.
"e-cigs. I still vape very low nicotine juices, because frankly I love it. But I haven't burned tobacco leaf in over two years. My lungs have never felt better. Check out /r/electronic_cigarette. "
"By the words of great Eminem, ""You can do anything you set your mind to, man"".
Seriously though, you can. I smoked for 6 years straight. Last year, I joined a gym and when exercising I noticed that I'd get tired easily. I started imagining my future. All sick and weak, possibly with cancer. A burden to myself and all others around me. The very next day, I quit. No gum, no 3-cigs, no nothing. I thought about it and took action. And haven't looked back since then. :)"
"**HABIT CHANGES.** When I decided I wanted to quit, I changed a lot of the habits that were my ""smoking triggers."" I didn't drink coffee or alcohol for a month or two, when I needed some air I would go out a different part of the building than when I would go out for a cigarette, etc. Eliminating smoking cues and triggers helped me immensely.  "
"A Heart Attack, a wife (And mother of our 4 kids) threatening to kill me if she ever saw me with another cigarette and Chantix.
But seriously, If one method does not work, try another. Not everything works for everyone, but there is bound to be something out there than can help you out, given enough willpower."
"First I stopped trigger smoking, so the wake up smoke the after food smoke the driving smoke I cut all those out, I did not schedule smokes but I waited until I had a craving. separating the habbit from the cravings was the first step. I also stopped thinking of myself as a smoker. it is weird how that activity had become part of my identity. I was the smoking friend in my group of friends. some serious thought about who I was other than a smoker make ignoring the habit smokes easier. it was not me any more.
second I started to think of smoking as gross. basically some self imposed aversion therapy. 
lastly I tried cold turkey a few times but eventually ended up on wellbutrin. because I had already broke the habit and was smoking on cravings only wellbutrin cutting the cravings made quitting a snap. after a week on wellbutrin I was smoke free and by the end of the month I was off wellbutrin and not smoking. it was very strange to see someone go smoke and not want to go with them. suddenly smokers were very odd to me. getting up and going outside in the middle of fun with friends.
I would like to note that I tried cold turkey many times and failed. I also tried patches and gums and failed. I even tried e-cigs and ended up sucking on those more than I smoked. Nicotine is hard to quit. 90% of the battle is mental. get the triggers and self identity out of the way and the rest is much easier.
**ALSO** if you do not want to quit. do not try. really ask yourself if you want to quit. every smoker says they want to quit because society guilt and shames you into saying that. unless you want to quit you will fail. there is some serious emotional/mental work that you have to do separating the cravings from what you really want. once you sort all of that out you will be able to move forward.
Good Luck!"
"I met a guy. He never asked me to quit or said anything to me, but I knew he didn't really like it. I woke up one morning and decided that was it. I threw my cigarettes away and haven't touched one since. That was 3.5 years ago! "
"A combination of Allen Carr's book along with 8 weeks of Chantix worked for me after more than 25 years of smoking. After about 3 weeks or so on Chantix, I wasn't getting any satisfaction from smoking. After smoking a cigarette, I felt the same as I did when I went out to smoke. The book really helped me understand nicotine addiction as well. 35 days for me. I made my mind up not to smoke another cigarette, no matter how bad I think I want one. Making your mind up and sticking to it is a large part of it. "
"I quit cold turkey a little over 2 years ago, after a 4 week bout with bronchitis/pneumonia. Smoked during the sickness, even though I could barely breath, was insane coughing, and it hurt to take a shallow breath, I would still smoke. Good thing I had the sickness to force me to stop. Then when I was back in good health, I realized I it was time for my relationship with cigarettes to come to an end. So haven't touched one since. Won't even take a drag when drunk...cuz that'll start the whole cycle again."
cold turkey the day my son was born
"I haven't had a cigarette in a month and did it cold turkey.  I guess it also helped that I was kinda sick before hand, which made me not want to smoke. "
"Tried to quit cold turkey lots of times and it never worked. Your brain starts playing tricks on you trying to convince you that you don't actually want to quit and your reasons for wanting to quit aren't valid. You like smoking, why stop something you like? Everything is bad for you, you might as well enjoy things while you can. It really fucks with your mind.
I ended up getting patches and they were miraculous. My other big issue was that the physical withdrawal would make me so irritable I couldn't even be around anyone. Patches solved that right away."
"I'm 24, been smoking since I was 19. I've recently been spending a lot more time at home to deflate from a very stressful last few years. I noticed that it's been very easy to quit because I'm not around different people constantly going to have a cigarette. A lot of times I wouldn't even smoke because I wanted a cigarette, I was just in a moment of boredom and going to smoke a cigarette was something to do. I've never smoked more than half a pack a day (on average) so it's probably easier for me than someone who smokes a pack or two a day. I feel like I would die instantly if I ever smoked that much."
"Champix helped me get past the initial month, then I went without any meds.
It really does work.  By the time I quit, Champix had made smoking absolutely disgusting.  I could barely get through a whole one anymore."
Honestly I was so sick of the cold so I bought this e-cig not sure what it's called (it's a different kind of e-cig with refillable cartridges using a liquid) I was at about a pack a day. I still got the craving for a cig but I'd just ignore it and a week later the cravings stopped.  It's much more cost effective than cigs!
Have you tried hi fiving your cat?
"i was about a pack a day smoker 6 years ago. My wife & i were trying to get pregnant when it happened i promised to stop smoking. About a month before we finally did get pregnant i came down the most horible stomach sickness i have ever had i couldnt even keep down water for almost two weeks almost ended up in the hospital very very painful. I was in so much pain & agony i honestly never even thought about a cigarette, after i got better i have never touched caffine (another bad habbit of mine at the time) or cigaretts. Like i said its been 6 years."
"I quit for two reasons:
1. Man partner is asthmatic and I didn't want to be responsible for causing him breathing problems.
2. I was unemployed and had a moment of reflection after I borrow $20 from my mother to buy a pack of cigarettes.
I had a few slip ups on the way. For some reason I thought smoking in the shower with the fan on would cover the smell. Don't do this, your ceiling turns yellow. But I've been smoke free for nearly 9 years and it feels great! I still get the odd craving a few times a year (normally after dreaming about smoking) though which is strange."
"My insurance company said, that they will charge me an extra $40 a month for every smoking member in my family.
I quit as soon as that policy kicked in. I just didn't smoke anymore. It was that easy. The first week was rough, but no issue after that anymore. I have been smoke free for over two years."
"The cold hard truth is that you have to have the willpower to quit. Most smokers who ""want"" to quit, don't really ""want"" to. If you absolutely want to quit, you can and will.
Don't get me wrong, I was a smoker for 7 years, and it was very difficult to quit, and took multiple attempts.
What eventually worked for me was quitting cold turkey on Friday, then hitting the gym HARD doing LOTS and LOTS of CARDIO. Why cardio? Because cardio helps evaporate the toxins in your body faster. The first week is crucial. You have to get as much shit out of your body before you start craving cigarettes like a mother fucker.
Quitting TIPS:
Don't eat big meals. You'll just want a cigarette.
Cut all friends that smoke out of your life, they don't give two shits whether you quit or not. You'll notice their always the first ones to hand you a cigarette, and peer pressure you back in to smoking again. Tell them to fuck off. If they care about you they will understand and respect you.
Stop drinking alcohol - for obvious reasons.
If you are really hard core, you'll stop having sex for a while too. Ask any real smoker: Big meals, Alcohol, and sex give you the biggest cigarette cravings.
You want to quit, you have to be serious about quitting. Remember, quitting means you'll be gaining part of your life back. You will no longer be controlled by cigarettes, and you'll realize how stupid it was to let your life be controlled by such a thing. Good luck!"
"Going out of town without cigarettes. 
They're not just a physical habit, they're a psychological one. And the best way to break a habit is to take yourself outside of your normal living situation and into a completely different one, because then a *lot* of your habits are thrown off. 
I went to a convention across the country, slept in a different bed, ate food at restaurants I'd never been to, and partied all weekend with people I didn't know. I didn't eat any meals at the same times I usually did, and there were no 'reminders' of my normal life, so it was actually pretty easy to go cold turkey. 
I was out of town for 4 days and when I got back the craving was still there, but the psychological *need* was gone, and that made it manageable.
Plan a trip somewhere. It doesn't need to be expensive or exotic. Just get away from your normal routine, and don't take cigarettes with you. Make sure there are plenty of activities to keep you occupied, and grit your teeth and power through."
"Quit drinking. Seriously. You have to. Eventually I got so sick of cigarettes that I would not smoke unless I had had more than two drinks. First drink, fine. Still don't want to smoke. Second drink, ok. I'm good. Still don't want to smoke. Second drink is gone, I start thinking about it, looking around to see if people are smoking. Take one sip of third drink, ""Alright, who's got cigarettes? Can I get one o' them?"" I probably needed to stop drinking that much anyways, so I took a few years off. Now I can drink a couple of beers and not need to smoke. Smoked for 15 years. Chances are, if you have this kind of association with booze and smokes, you won't be able to drink without wanting to smoke. And you're drunk, so your decision making is poor and you end up smoking. If you put down the drink for at least a few months, you should be good. It's probably proportional to how long you smoked for. I would say at least a month or two for every year you were a smoker. At least. Sounds like you want to quit, so my advice is to lay off the booze for awhile. Eventually, you can probably return to drinking, as long as you are careful. "
"I smoked for about seven years (15yo to 22yo). Once I realized how shitty they were making me feel (sort of was having an allergic-like reaction), I just quit.  Never went back."
I smoke cigars on occasion now instead. Stay classy. 
Pregnancy! 
"""The Easy Way"" by Allen Carr and birth of my daughter. 3 years now, no regrets and feeling great."
"I left the military, quit drinking and picked up marijuana."
The patch worked for me.  My doc was about to prescribe me Wellbutrin if that didn't work.  It's been 8 years.
"1 you have to learn how to relax yourself rather than relying on some external button, and be committed to this endeavor
2 you have to learn to enjoy oxygen and breathes for the sake of it and ideally as a core characteristic of your reality as a human 
3 a firm commitment to the idea that humans are not supposed to live in/with/around poison 
4 a firm disgust with what your cigarrette addiction actually is, you paying someone else to help you poison yourself, and they are buying yachts with the money you give them
5 a firm disgust for what cigarrettes and things like them represent in your body, they are mafia thugs taking a % of everything you do
6 cold turkey in a different environment than usual, i.e. a relatives home who doesn't smoke, and commit to stay there for a solid week watching netflix and just being, not freaking out, waking sleeping eating without cigarettes
7 a pound of breathmints, wintergreen were my choice to handle the oral fixation.  for a year after i stopped i didn't feel comfortable leaving the house without 3 or so in my pocket and eventually i didn't need them.
8 a firm loathing of the idea of admitting defeat, going back, doing this all over again, as in this was my last cigarette and i have triumphed
gave it up in 2004 and despite half a clove in 2007 have not had one since and if i'm confession bear honest, everyone i now see who smokes cigarerettes continually demonstrate to me that they do not have their emotional shit together whatsoever and I tend to see cigarette smokers then as emotional babies and they have a tendency towards being a huge mess to be around.  
Hope this helps.  I personally do not believe it should be legal to sell anything that is poisonous although people should be able to grow and possess whatever they want for themselves.  
Also it helps to first switch to actual tobacco rolling your own and this will get you off the mystery addiction toxins that phillip morris has designed for mind control or who knows what.  
The most important change after quitting?  Having my uninterrrupted time back.  "
will power
"Its simple ... you have to decide to stop. 
Everyone is different. For my wife and I, it was deciding to stop to prepare to get pregnant, and my solidarity with her in doing so. 
But my own sense is you have a justification in your head for smoking ... and that is your job stresses you out, and your only way to take a break is to smoke ... thats a self fulfilling prophecy; you can't quit because you need breaks because your job stresses you out, and the only way to get a break is to take a smoke break ... 
Go deeper; why would anyone smoke if they're in healthcare? second hand, and deeper studies on 'third hand' smoke (residue on fingers, clothes, etc) should prevent smoking altogether in a health care environment. But if you 'need' a break, then work on eliminating why you need the break so that you remove that justification from your mind. 
We went cold turkey. After years of getting sick, already knowing that smoking is bad, even though I love it, smoking just gets stupid. The decision that its bad and stupid to do is a mindset that for us just clicked. One day, its ok to smoke, the next, nope ... done. 
Once in awhile as recreation, maybe 2-3 times a year, I'll have a smoke (vegas or with a client or something), and I feel like complete shit physically the next morning ... its worse than a hangover truthfully because i feel it every time I breathe, and in my throat ... and the residual smell is just disgusting. I kick myself every time because like I said, I really enjoy smoking, but everything that comes with it (on top of death) is simply not worth it. 
You can infinitely justify why you need it, why you need to be around it, whatever. But if you don't actually buy in, quitting won't work for you.
Ask yourself if you really, really are ready to quit, and if you are, then simply be done. You'll be grumpy for about a week or so ... then trying going for a walk, or up some stairs, a jog or run, and see how you feel. The difference will be unbelievable. 
"
"Don't put another cigarette in your mouth, pretty much it."
"Ice cold turkey.
I quit before, lasted around 6 months, then I started again, currently going on twenty something days, but I'm set on not smoking and facing the challenges that come with it head on this time.
Also I got an app called QuitNow Pro for android, it is a good motivator as it keeps track of cigs you haven't smoked, and more tangible, the money you've saved while awarding you small achivements.
Also, the motivation and support of /r/stopsmoking  helps a lot in the rough periods."
"20+ years of smoking, ( 10 of that being a dipper between smokes) I got disgusted with it so many times. The wheezing, the stinky car and home. 4 years ago I decided something had to change. My breathing was becoming very labored and I simply started using the dip more frequently. I substituted the dip for the cigarettes for the next 3 years. My lip was starting to turn raw and my dentist said( precancerous growths) so... I started cutting back and using nicotine gum in addition to dip. Finally about 7 months ago I quit the dip and the nicotine gum, and just started chewing regular gum. It was much easier than I ever thought.
"
Had a kid. 
"Change of location (I visited a friend in florida) got me out of habits (e.g. smoke on the way to work, on lunch break, etc), and smoked herb (to get the oral/smoke cessation). Was way easier than when I tried quitting while working and keeping the same routine. Also, as others mentioned, cold turkey'ed it. "
"I became 'funemployed', and couldn't afford cigs in lieu of food and rent. Of course, compared to other times I've been unemployed, I had a kid this time, so I couldn't just surf on ramen to afford my habit."
Had my wisdom teeth taken out after 6 years of smoking. Was unable to even take puff. GOt over the the first 2 weeks and then that was that

"The only people I know of that have SUCCESSFULLY quit smoking for good (including some that smoked for like 40 years), have done it one of two ways:
1) Cold Turkey
2) E-cig...a good one, not the kind from a gas station.
Anything else, tapering off, pills, patches, whatever, has always relapsed.  Even the above two ways only worked for someone that really actively WANTED it to work, not just ""oh i should stop smoking."""
"wellbutrin. tell your doctor you quit smoking two weeks ago, and now you have a lot of anxiety. wellbutrin will be prescribed for the anxiety, on label. What it does OFF LABEL is relieve all the physical symptoms of withdrawal - even that creeping backache thing you get after the third nicfit. Plan to stay on the pills for six months, then slowly reduce your dosage till you're clean."
"I smoked for half a year, then I just decided to quit."
"As someone who used to do chewing tobacco, I didn't stop until the price doubled."
"Celebrating 11 months cigarette free  after 10 years of smoking. 
I'd tried multiple times to stop, but ""quitting for my health"" simply wasn't a compelling enough reason..I suppose only a smoker could understand that kind of logic!
I was gonna get a deviated septum surgery back In April and the doctor told me I couldn't smoke the month before so I had to stop in march. After the surgery, he advised that I didn't smoke for a little while and I decided to just keep going. 
**I analyzed the ever loving shit out of the task at hand** when I first stopped. I discovered that my mind was terrified of quitting smoking because it was so integrated into everything I did. Eating, drinking, driving...I decided to start simple. The last week as a smoker, I ""quit smoking"" in my car. It was difficult but at least I could smoke when before or after. When it finally came time to completely stop, the muscle memory for car smoking was already kind of dulled down.
Also, the oral fixation was a big concern of mine.
I don't know how smoking works in your state, but here in NC, we pretty much can't smoke anywhere indoors, and I'll come back to that..
I knew that I needed to find something to latch onto after I stopped smoking, so I thought tic tacs would be a reasonable crutch. However, I was afraid that I might get tired of them, so I did something that I'm actually convinced was the reason I could successfully replace tic tacs with cigarettes:
I only sucked on tic tacs in places where it was legal to smoke.
Something people might not understand is that smoking is an incredibly social activity. I actually lamented the loss of my smoke break, my inability to chit chat and form relationships with smoking co workers at my new job...but mostly, I just loved sitting on my back porch with a cigarette!
Did I have to give all of that up? Hell no. The only thing I gave up was cigarettes. For about a month, whenever I wanted a tic tack I'd put on my coat, go outside, sit down and enjoy a couple tic tacs and when I was finished, I went back inside.
I'm in a restaurant? I just finished my meal and want a tic tac?
Nope, illegal to smoke inside, illegal to have a tic tac inside. I think this seriously is the reason why up to this point I've been successful at quitting:my new temporary vice never got boring because I set conditions that I'd already grown accustomed to with smoking! I outgrew the need for tic tacks before they got boring
The months behind me incentivize the years ahead, and if I ever have an urge or a trigger (which I don't think will ever stop, and I'm ok with that) I just step outside and have a tic tac :)
Oh, for reference:
[i checked this regularly in the first days/weeks and it helped me stay motivated](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html)"
"I got more stubborn than the fuckin' darts.
I started at 18 on cigars while I drank. Then moved to cigs because they had filters, convincing myself that they were ""less dangerous"". Hah. Smoked on and off for 8 years (more on than off, I'd go maybe 2 weeks without tops every year or so). I told myself that I'll be damned if I am caught smoking for 10 years, fuck that noise.
I tried prescriptions, I tried patches (helped a little), I tried inhalers. The only thing that got me on the right track was the lozenges. I cut back to 3 a day on my own, but I couldn't seem cut it out completely. One in the morning, one after lunch, and one after supper. In between, I stuck with the lozenges. I did that for about 3 days, and realized I'm not helping myself, because my body is still craving the nicotine. I fucking quit after that for ~1 year.
I've had cigars on vacation in Florida, only because it was a debauchery kind of thing. I spend 50 bucks on ""decent"" cigars, and only drank and smoked one night. I gave the rest of my cigars away because the next morning, I couldn't even stand to look at them, let alone smell them. I doubt I'll do that again. I also felt guilty as fuck, like I cheated myself. I kind of did.
I like the idea of having a ""streak"" of days smoke-free. That's what keeps me going. Every day I dont smoke is a victory over the darts. Fuck 'em."
"Asthma and allergies. It got to a point where if I tried to smoke a cigarette, I couldn't breathe. Made quitting cold turkey pretty easy.
People make it out to be such a bigger deal than it is with their addiction, like they will die if they even begin to try to quit. It's just silly justification of not truly wanting to quit. Just be honest with yourself.
I felt like I had the flu for 3 days, after that it was almost all mental  fighting the desire to calm your nerves and how easily you get agitated. But I felt like the physical dependence as far as feeling shitty was more or less gone after those few days, and after a few weeks I was back to normal.
Sadly, I did replace it with eating and gained a ton of weight now that my appetite wasn't suppressed and I needed something to fill the cigarette void. So definitely try to avoid that pitfall and replace it with chewing gum or something."
"I may not be the best person to comment as i was only smoking 1-3 cigarettes a day before i quit, but I still did manage to recently quit after smoking for 8 years. i was also a just got sick of what i was doing to my body. (also my girlfriend hated it!) one day i just decided to walk away from it. it has only been roughly 60 days smoke free but i still feel accomplished and much better about my health."
"I was on a trip where it was impossible to get a hold of them little fuckers. When I came back home I said ""fuck it"" and never bought one again. 
Sports are a good way to reduce anxiety. Whenever you find yourself in a situation that may trigger cravings  ( a night out drinking, other smoker friends, a coffee break at work) chew a loot of gum and drink lots of water. These two relieved the sudden urges and helped me a lot. Also, tell anyone who once told you to stop that you're trying to, their excitement and that little "" good for you, good job"" can be a huge motivation.  "
"I smoked for 32 years.   Wish I never started.
I quit (5 years now).
Tried and tried.
What worked for me was Champix/Chantix but with some REAL CAVEATS!
It did numb the cravings and make quitting way easier but at a price.
The price was, it changes who you are for a while.  I had ZERO patience with anything.   My wife did the same and turned into GODZILLA!   That being said, I researched it and found that after we had 'ramped up' onto our dose (ramp on and off!  This is a must!), we cut it back to 50% of the suggested daily dose and we still had the effects, but somewhat less of the personality disorders.
Also NOTE: You may feel suicidal or violent.  It's important to have someone monitoring your behavior and temperament while on this.  Some folks don't have any issues.   But IT DOES WORK!   There's just a cautious trade off.
Other news:
I have a buddy who is the absolute KING of quitting smoking.  I've known him for 16 years and this guy has ""quit"", literally(!) once or twice a year.   I never would have guessed what worked for him.
Hypnosis!  The guy he went to was strictly word of mouth and spent a solid 6-7 hours just talking to him about his life, smoking, exercise, happiness, etc.  Only after this and asking him questions like ""When I say blah blah - what exactly is in your head when you hear that?"",  ""Do you see the *word* in your head, or an image?"", stuff like that.
Then, the next day, he came back for about 2-3 hrs and during that was hypnotized.   
He hasn't smoked in 3 years.   Longest he *ever* went was about 4-5 months.   
Now, also, let me say that I was freaked when he told me he was doing hypno.   He is SOOOO NOT a guy to buy into the whole new age, hocus pocus shit.  But he did it because he felt he was going to throw it all at the wall and *hope* something 'stuck'.
I have, over the last 3 years, repeatedly asked him ""So, what's the deal?  Any puffs?  Do you *really* think it was the hypno?  ...Come on!  Seriously?  Honest now.""  etc.
It freaking worked.   I looked the guy up that he went to and he is no ""Yellow Pages"" kind of hypnotist.  This guy is the real deal if ever there was one (and I am a skeptical MuthaFucka!).
Based on my buddy's experience I have changed my opinion of the validity of Hpyno.  Not entirely, but enough to not rule it out ever again.
Ultimately, cold turkey is having willpower over yourself.   If you are not a willful person in general.  Likely CT aint gonna do it unless you're looking at at blotch on your chest X-ray.  You'll need help whether that's a support group, or drugs, or whatever.   
Best of luck.
That's my anecdotal."
Will power. It was mind over matter for me
"I got to the point where smoking was no longer enjoyable for me.  I hated waking up with a sore throat after a hard night of drinking and chain smoking.  I hated coughing up things, and it even got to the point where I hated the actually act of smoking.  I decided one day that I was going to just stop, and I did.  The first 3 days sucked, but after that it was good to go.  I did end up gaining about 5 pounds though."
/r/electronic_cigarette nuff said
Wanted that to be a real thing...
"Smoked from the age of 17 to about 34. I had toyed with quitting a few times over the years (especially towards the end), but it never stuck. Smoking was simply too large a part of how I envisioned myself.
Finally, I quit for my girlfriend (now wife). We were getting really serious and she really wanted me to quit. It just seemed like the right reason -- to do it for her. I don't think I would have ever done it ""for myself"". I think that you just need to find a reason to quit that truly means something to you. Maybe you do it for yourself, maybe for someone else, but it has to be for something that you really prioritize more than smoking. In my case that was my wife.
BTW -- I finally quit by simply going cold turkey. Not saying it was easy, but that is how I did it. I had tried the gum in my previous failed attempts at quitting, but that just seemed to drag out the misery of eventually trying to get off entirely. I am of the opinion that there is a tremendous about of hype out there supporting the notion that it is really, really hard to quit smoking. I also am of the opinion that this is just fine with the tobacco companies as this notion creates a very difficult mental barrier for anyone who is thinking about no longer being a consumer of their products. It is not easy to break any habit, but it is possible to stop if it is truly a goal you set for yourself."
"I quit cold turkey. I am not going to lie, it still fucks with me and it has been 5+ years. I still get a craving and sometimes when I get really hammered I bum a smoke from a stranger and then I usually get sick. In those 5 years Id say I had one or two cigarettes per year if I was drunk enough. It is all mental, if you keep stringing it along with the gum and the e-cigs I don't think youll ever quit.
Buy a fuck load of gum and just sever ties with the smokes. just do it."
"I also have had many attempts at quitting until i finally succeeded. What i did do differently when i managed to quit were the following : 
1. Eat oranges when you feel the craving to smoke. You will be eating lots in the first month after quitting.
2. Work out. When you work out you help your body eliminate the toxins that keep you addicted.
These 2 things helped me quit. I'm not saying you don't need will power but doing these 2 things can help a lot. Hope this helps you quit, GL."
"E-Cigs.  I had a respiratory infection a couple years ago and couldn't smoke for at least a week or so.  So I had some time to think about it.  I didn't really WANT to quit smoking, I just knew it was terrible and I SHOULD stop.
After researching, I decided to try E-Cigs.  Whatever you believe about how healthy or not they are doesn't matter for this example.  They're ALMOST as good as smoking regular cigarettes, and my desire to smoke went down and down.  I could quit entirely if I wanted to now.  I sometimes go weeks without taking a drag off of one.  I now enjoy them only when I feel like it.  (a social drink, sometimes with coffee, etc)  I probably ""vape"" around a pack's worth a cigarettes a MONTH.  
The desire just went away.  Smoking 11-16mg of nicotine e-cigs."
Getting Sick was my strategy for stopping. I made my mind up that i wanted to quit so i made a deal with myself that the next time I got sick I would quit smoking. (cause I never really felt like smoking when i was sick so i thought it would be the perfect time.) Cold turkey was the only way for me and its been 15years.
"Just stop buying and stop being so weak. Whatever is troubling you is in the past. Hakuna Matata. In all reality, ridding yourself of the drama inducing elements helps, but excuses otherwise just conclude you are indeed lazy and wasting money on a drug that is killing you. I stopped smoking by first using Logic vapes for a couple of months then finally stopped. Be something other that THAT."
I wanted to change something about myself. I stuck to it. At first I shortened the amount (one in the morning and one in the evening until eventually just one in the evening). I smoke pot. So eventually I only smoked pot once per evening in place of my cigarette. I haven't bought a pack in over half a year. Feels high man.
"When I was in the armed forces I quit for six months before going to boot camp. The way I went about it was to just study my research material whenever I had a nic-fit. Not only did I quit but I also learned that book front to back and went to basic training several steps ahead of everybody else.
Better believe my ass started smoking again pretty much as soon as the military would let me, though."
"Waking up in the middle of the night and coughing until I vomited. That's when I decided I need to stop. I still dream about smoking a cigarette, I still feel the need to smoke, but every day without smoking make me feel so proud. I quit many times before and the thing that always got me back was thinking ""Oh I havent smoked for half a year, one cigarette with a beer won't make me an addict again"". That's why I don't count the days without a cigarette anymore. When you quit, you have to quit for the rest of your life."
"Having my lung collapse.
Actually had quit about a month before this happened but this wasnt my first time trying to quit. The lung collapse helped me stay quit. 
Fear is a great motivator. Was too scared to put anything bad into my lungs after knowing what it feels like to not be able to breath properly, having a bunch of tubes shoved in me and having to have surgery. Had been smoke free for over 10 years now, dont even miss it.
Interesting side note: I do have occasional ""nightmares"" where I am smoking in my dream and realize that Im not supposed to be smoking so I get really upset at myself in my dream. I am totally relieved when I wake up and realize I was just dreaming"
"Three things:
An E-Cig, having a bottle of water in my hand at all times, a false positive on a cardiac test that scared the crap out of me.
OK, maybe it was that last one that really did it."
"Chantix.  I've heard all about the side effects and I was pretty nervous.  The only time I'd quit before was using the acculaser therapy that was hyped up a few years ago, but it only worked for a month.  I used chantix for a few weeks before tapering off and then fully quitting.  There wasn't any depression or mood swings or other side effects save for vivid dreams.  They were the best dreams ever!  The most memorable involved me at the local bar drinking with Mitt Romney who was campaigning for the election that had already passed.  I was nominated to tell him he lost and he got sad and his face got small and his head got bigger.  The next thing I know we've stolen and ambulance and crashed into a culvert on a highway.  BEST.  DREAM.  EVER.  Oh yeah, I've been smoke free since 4/17/13.  I know it's not terribly long but it's great not smoking and the cravings I do get are pretty easy to suppress."
"I started smoking for the very same reason. Some time later after several failed attempts to quit I got cancer. Turns out to be totally unrelated to smoking but 8 months of chemo was sufficient evidence that I needed to stop.
I hope you find something short of that that well convince you."
"I'm not a smoker, but my boss used to be before I met him. He told me that a big part of quitting was he started snacking on sunflower seeds. Kept his mouth busy with something that wasn't terrible for him."
Snus
"E-cigs. Quit smoking, and picked up a cool hobby!
They allowed me split the detox from the excess nitrogen and carbon monoxide, and the nicotine withdrawal into two experiences, instead of one suckfest. Steadily dropping down the nicotine level, but I'm not even really worried about it, as nicotine isn't that bad. It's all the other shit in cigarettes that kills you.
Your mileage may vary, but I haven't had a cigarette since last May."
"I told my girlfriend I was going to quit and she mocked me, saying ""*Look at me, I'm [noturbob], I'm going to quit!* No you won't. You don't have the will power to do anything let along quit smoking."" I put out my cigarette and crumpled up the rest of my pack right then and there. We broke up a week later and I haven't smoked since. It's been 15 years.
So... Anger. And proving people wrong. That's what helped me go cold turkey.
(Also, when the cravings and chest tightness became too strong, I would hold my head underwater for as long as I could, or at least until I couldn't tell the difference between lungs burning from holding my breath and lungs tight from wanting a cigarette.  Edit to add one more technique I would use when I wasn't near a bathtub or a body of water: I would take a pen that was about the diameter of a cigarette and wrap one layer of cloth tape around the end of it. When I had a craving, I would pretend to light it then take imaginary drags off of it. It was amazing how the mere routine of smoking could help reduce the cravings.)"
My mom smoked 2 packs a day for 30+ years and then went to see a hypnotist with her friend in order to quit. Neither of them have touched a cigarette since. It's crazy but I can tell you it works.
Better electronic one.
"I'm late to the game, but I smoked marijuana instead.  Then I quit marijuana.  I'm clean on both for 7 years."
Girlfriend doesn't like smoking....I like sex more then smoking.
"I agree with cold turkey. After four years of smoking a pack a day, I just decided to actually quit. Two months down. "
Getting pregnant :) the last time I smoked was on my way to buy a pregnancy test with my first. Haven't had one since.. (It's been 3 years now)
Having children....
"I took up ecigs. Sure, it seems like an awesome alternative, I love them. But, being able to not rely on or crave anything at all is nice. I used ecigs for several months after several years of smoking, but i quit unintentionally. I visited home for a bit and was around family so I held back. Near the end of my vacation I realized I went 3 days without smoking or vaping. I had no intentions to quit but reached a point where I just thought 'hmm, if I really wanted to I could stop now and save money.' I'm 2-3 weeks clean, and its alright, but I'll always have urges. I've quit like this a lot, and honestly, I'll probably pick it up again. Ecigs sound like a good idea, and they are awesome for quitting, but more than likely it will only replace real smoking. Its an awesome alternative, but if you really want to quit go cold turkey and tough it out."
"I used gum, but it only took because I could point to a time and place where I really didn't want to be a smoker, and I kept that in mind when I had cravings. I was going on a beach vacation with my then-girlfriend's (now wife) family, and there were going to be 6 kids with us under the age of 12. I didn't want to have to lie or explain why I had to ""take a walk"" every hour or two and tell them that they couldn't come along. The vacation was planned about 6 months in advance, and by the time we hit the beach, I was completely off the gum for months. 
tl;dr
If you can find a specific reason you won't want to smoke, it will make quitting a million times easier."
"Cold turkey.  The last pack of cigarettes I purchased was in October 2012.  I was going over my, and my wife's, finances and I realized that our 1 pack/day @ $6 a pack was costing us around $85 a week.  That's $4420 a year just in cigarettes.  At that time, I was making $12.50 an hour which is roughly $25,000 a year.  My wife was making around $30,000.  8% of our income every year was going to cigarettes.  I decided right then and there, that I was smoking the last pack of cigarettes I would ever purchase.
I didn't throw that pack away.  I paid for it.  I derived some amount of pleasure from them.  I just decided that the pleasure wasn't worth the cost.  The pack ran out.  I had 3 days of feeling like shit.  Then I got over it.
My advice to quit smoking: Go cold turkey.  Grow up. Make a decision to stop.  Stick to your guns.  The longterm cravings are psychological, they can't effect you if you know that the decision was one that made because you WANTED to, and for no other reason than that.  You have to want it."
for me it was having a baby. i tried everything but that was the life change that gave me the motivation to quit. 3 years strong now :D
"Firstly, you have to want to give up. Second, once you have given up for a bit, few days, whatever, if you fuck up and buy another pack at the store, even if you light up once, throw the rest of that pack away. It gets expensive real fast. Eventually you will stop buying packs or be so broke you won't be able to."
"I smoked a whole pack while drinking heavily the night before and woke up the next morning with the taste of a bottle depo in my mouth. It was a brutal hangover and couldn't touch a smoke that whole day.
I became a hermit on day 2 and 3 and played completely though Portal 1 and 2.
Day 4 was hard so I bought an E-Cig which held me over. Every day after that became easier and easier. Anyone can quit smoking, you just can't let yourself down and give up on it. Just take it day by take.
Now sugar, that's an addiction. "
"Smoked for 10 years more than 25 a day.
One day I was walking in the garden and stopped. Then I was thinking 'what's that awful smell here?' and realized it was my own odor I was carrying. 
Then I realized I had yellow fingers and that I was constantly busy in my head with the number of cigarettes that were left in the package, and where I could buy new ones.
Decided that that was the wrong way of living a life. Stopped cold turkey, bam!
Now 10 years clean and running ultra-marathons. "
"You need to do it for yourself. Not anyone else. Lots of people say they did it for their kid, their spouse, etc. Well what happens if they leave this earth? It can happen to anyone. You should plan accordingly."
"This comment surely will be downvoted to hell but here we go - what helped me quit after 6 years is actually switching from prefabricated cigarettes to rolling tobacco. The process of switching was actually a challenge all by itself - manufactured cigarettes are much more addictive than regular tobacco, etc. 
The idea behind switching to rolling tobacco is, well, to only roll a cigarette when you really want to smoke. Sometimes, if not most of the time, you only smoke not because you actually want to smoke but because you don't know what to occupy yourself with, and the presence of a pack of fags on the table does not exactly help it. So the goal is - you want to smoke --> you have to work a little for that by rolling a cigarette. This way, I stopped smoking twice an hour the first week, smoked once in 3 hours the following week, etc - you stop consuming as much tobacco because, well, you become lazy to roll. After that, getting rid of tobacco was not such a big issue for me - the first two days were the hardest of course but days after that have become manageable. 
**TL,DR** : Rolling tobacco will make you lazy to roll. ??? PROFIT."
I went cold turkey once and it worked. Started smoking 2 years ago and wanna stop again. Gotta believe.
"Chantix got me going, but like everyone says, you have to have your mind made up. To push through it, the voices in my head had a daily argument...voice 1 ""No way, I can't take this anymore, I 'm going to buy a pack"" voice 2 "" Whoa, hang on, ok so your saying we're going to start back... We'll fine, do me one favor, let's just wait until tomorrow and I promise I won't say a word"" .aaaand that conversation went on for months."

cold turkey doesn't work for everyone. Come on over to /r/electronic_cigarette
"Cold turkey. I started smoking on and off when I was 18, and continued untuil I was about 26 or 27 at varying amounts. Near the end I was smoking around a pack a day. I got to a point where I did not like the way it made me feel and I had just had enough. It sounds like you are there too.
So, cold turkey. It took a few false starts, but then finally I just did it. One thing I found that absolutely helped was to make sure I completely banned doing it when my big trigger hit. For me it was driving. I used to smoke 3 or 4 on the way to and from work. When I got a new car, I made it a rule that I would not smoke in it. Even though the trigger was there, I eliminated it as a reason to smoke, and the rest eventually came fairly easy.
The first two weeks for me were hard. Cravings like all day every day. And yes you feel like crap too. Find something else to occupy your thoughts and do something else for that whole oral fixation thing. After the first two weeks though, the physical cravings died down significantly. I still got those urges, but they were easily manageable.
It has been about 3 years now? And I have lost all desire to smoke whatsoever. I went to a bachelor party a few months ago and it was going to be my cheat weekend. I smoked one cigarette and found it so thoroughly revolting that I know I am done for good.
Feel free to respond here or send a message if you have any other questions. And good luck!"
Nortriptyline and Tetris. Cold turkey. I only get the craving every couple months now - it's been 18 years.
"Probably too late for this but I thought I'd share anyway. Smoked here and there for a while, then went on deployment where I smoked like crazy- at least half a pack a day which even then was a shit ton for me. Came back and my fiancÌ©e just wouldn't have it- if I came from anywhere smelling like smoke it would be a huge fight and lighting up at home or anywhere near her was completely out of the question. It got to the point where it wasn't worth it and I stopped smoking and we stopped fighting about it, almost a year and a half later I haven't had a cigarette since. I agree with others in this thread that the craving never goes away completely, but no matter how ok you think you feel now, your lungs and heart will feel so much better and your sense of smell and taste will come back- so much so that it will act as a huge deterrent to ever starting up again."
"I also smoked for many years, at least a pack a day. After getting short breathed and other health issues, I decided I really should quit. It took me about four attempts (some serious, some not), but I'm now going into my 6th smoke-free year, and I couldn't be happier.
Cold turkey is by far the best way to go, just throw away your pack and you're good to go. Two things really helped me to keep it up. First, I knew I would never ever smoke a cigarette again. I can't smoke on occassion, so it is all or nothing. In this case, nothing. 
An other thought that really helped was thinking, after getting through the first (awful) day: ""I made it through the first day. If I smoke one cigarette, I had to go through a terrible day for nothing."" That helped me to get through the second day. And I kept thinking that, if I light up one cigarette, all these shitty days were for nothing. And after two weeks, I felt better. And finally, after a year (going through all the situations where you would normally smoke), it wasn't really on my mind anymore.
And don't forget, you also can do the things you did while you were smoking, without a cigarette. I regularly go outside, and take a break. No need to light up though. Just keep that in mind and you can do it!"
"Altoids! Yeah those really strong mints, suck on one or two every hour or when you crave a smoke and do breathing exercises also.  It also really really helps to start an exercise routine /going to gym even if it's just walking a treadmill. Oh, and for me,  planning and counting down never worked. Just a random ""fuk this!"" And cold Turkey right there. "
"I quit cold turkey in a way. My doctor said pick a day, cut back as best you can but keep that day. On the day I quit, I had 4 cigs in a pack, they lasted me 4 days then done. I have not smoked in over 4 years. I was a smoker for 20. Now I can't stand to be around smokers, the smell is so bad. I'm sorry I was that guy for so long. "
"discipline. i quit cold turkey after just 8 consecutive years. sure, maybe it wasnt 30 years, but discipline is what it takes."
"V2 eCig. Was best compared to a bad orgasm--it's not great, but it's still good enough to get the job done. Took a few days to get used to the switch, but I would make the effort to take the same cig breaks at work with the eCig that I did with the real one--so actually go stand out side and puff on the thing for 3 minutes. Eventually, the need to use it just phased itself out without much conscious effort on my part. "
"You will only quit (for good) when you are MENTALLY ready to quit.  All of the smoking aids will help break the physical addiction, but if you are not mentally prepared, forget it.
"
"Pick a date, anywhere between 2 weeks or 2 months out, and quit cold turkey.  Make that day the last day of smoking.  Mine was the 4th of July.  I smoked myself sick that day because I knew it was my last.  I didn't even feel like smoking the next day but the 2nd and 3rd day off were really rough.  It worked though! It gets much easier after about a week."
"Honestly I got tired of having it on my to-do list. I didnt give a shit about cancer or smelling bad or tasting bad or whatever. almost 3 weeks without a cigarette so far. I think Ive kicked it, but I am avoiding getting drunk around my friends who smoke. the only time i want one now is when im drinking or listening to music that references it."
"0) quit drinking.  I don't think I could ever have quit smoking without quitting drinking first.  
1) smoked 8 years.  towards the end, started smoking cigars as well as cigarettes - it was like switching from beer to whiskey.  It felt like my smoking was getting kind of out of hand.  In the last couple years I seriously tried quitting two or three times but failed. 
2) for a few weeks, started putting off the morning cigarette, on the idea that the longest time you go without nicotine is while sleeping, and I'd just try to extend that.  
3) at some point I put off the morning cigarette the whole day, and never started back.  
4) for the first week I had to keep myself from going to get cigs about every five minutes.  for the second week it was more like 10 minutes.  After that it got much easier.  As time went by I'd just get tempted around less frequent events where I used to smoke - concerts, end of a big meal, etc.  
5) aerobic exercise was helpful - after exercise was about the only time I'd feel a little relaxed.  "
"I started smoking weed.
I'm pretty sure I only started smoking tobacco because I was in the military and there are HUGE chunks of time where all one has to do is smoke, so I picked up the habit.
Once I got out I picked up a new habit, then, one day, while working outside I decided to go have a smoke. I lit up a cigarette, took that first drag, said to myself 'This tastes like shit' and put it out."
"Quit cold turkey. Knew I had to quit smoking, said ""this is my last pack"" and never looked back. I smoked for about 6 years and wanted to give it up. I had tried cutting down and using gum but no luck. Yeah it sucked the first few days, and I got a bit cranky but you just need to distract yourself with something else. You need to mean it when you say you want to quit, or else you'll fail every time. If the cravings were really bad while I was at home, I'd smoke a bowl/joint and that helped a lot! Anyways, I quit cold turkey and its been just over a year now, cigarettes now make me feel sick. :)"
"Nasty but it works. 
 
Get a 2 liter bottle. Fill it up half with water. 
Ash in it. Throw your butts in it. Do this for a week. 
DRINK IT.  You will throw up. But afterwards the smell will make you want to vomit. You won't smoke again. 
Crazy voodoo man told me. 
I quit cold turkey. My peak was 2packs a day. "
"Absolutely cold turkey.  I've posted about this before, but it's the ONLY way I was able to quit after smoking for 10 years."
"You have to have something which makes smoking immediately worse than not smoking. 
I knew about the health problems. I knew my lung capacity was less than it could be, which was a big issue because I was a professional ballet dancer at the time. I knew a hundred reasons why i wanted to quit, but one thing kept me smoking (in addition to the nicotine), I LOVED SMOKING.
The thing that made me quit was my now wife, then GF. She would NEVER say anything, but when I would come back inside from having a smoke and would snuggle up next to her on the couch to continue watching the movie, i could SEE that i smelled HORRIBLE to her. And, bless her, she was trying so HARD to not let it show.
That is what did it for me. The thought of being repulsive in any way to my wife is unbearable to me. Whenever I would want a smoke, there was a clear, immediate consequence:
""You will be a repulsive stinky bastard to your girl, who is such an angel that she will not say anything and just be miserable till it dissipates.""
That is what broke it for me."
"I was a pretty heavy smoker, 1 1/2 packs a day, I went cold turkey til I couldn't handle it anymore.  Then I threw on a patch and I felt instant relief,  after that, I had faith in the patch"
Pretty much cold turkey. I had the lozenges that I used to get me through the tough cravings but I tried to use them sparingly. Eventually I just quit thinking about it. 
"I'm an anesthesiologist. I ask every patient that I've ever care for if they smoke or ever smoked. 
If they tell me they used to smoke,but quit, I ask them how they quit.  I grew up in a family of smokers, including my physician father who continued to smoke after being diagnosed cancer and quitting smoking is an interest of mine. I never smoked. 
Every single successful quitter (now there's  a funny phrase) I ever cared for told be a variation of ""I just quit.""  I did have on patient tell me he quit using the patch and someone I met socially told me he quit after one hypnosis session, but every other successful quitter quit by quitting. 
That may not be data, but it's a lifetime of the same anecdote. "
"After 13 years smoking I woke up one morning with the worst headache ever.  I attempted to stand but one of my legs had simply stopped working.  I had my wife call 911 because I thought it was a stroke.  Turns out, smoking had done so much damage to my circulatory system that my leg was dying from lack of oxygen.  I was treated and told that if I didn't quit smoking, I would lose my leg.  I didn't care that I would get cancer and die.  I didn't want to live with only one leg.  Cold turkey. I never smoked another cigarette.  "
"Broke my pack-a-day habit by: 
1. Being tired of everything smelling like smoke
2. Wanting to taste food again
3. Tired of scheduling my day around my habit
4. Having friends that were supportive/tolerant 
5. Using a Nicotine patch, which got me started, but then cold turkey
6. Reminding myself ""I don't smoke"" whenever a craving came up (and twenty years later, I still get cravings)
"
Willpower. Cold turkey. Redirect your addictive behavior toward not smoking. It worked for me. Same for nutrition and workout. Use a bad behavior toward something healthy.
I finally quit for good after several tries by choosing a time at the HEIGHT of personal stress. I did use the patch for about 4 days. I figured that if I didn't while stressed I would have no excuses to take it up again and I didn't. 
Bronchitis
"Cold turkey. Never tried any other ways though. I quit once about a year ago and ended up smoking again after moving into a new place with roommates who shared the same friend groups, and subsequently partied a lot more. But now that things have settled down around the house I quit again and really just don't even think about them other than when I get asked by people with a poor memory if I want to go smoke one. Probably has been something like 6-7 months although im not really positive."
"I started work at a new job where my boss doesn't smoke. I really like my boss, and I wanted to impress him by quitting. If he started smoking, I'd definitely start too. But he's a total health nut, so there's that.
"
"I don't know if this really qualifies me as ever having been addicted but I smoked for two years and only a few times a month maybe would I feel the NEED to smoke. In hindsight it was dumb. It was a social thing and I enjoyed it, there was definitely an oral fixation with the smoke too but ultimately I just... stopped. I never once felt like I depended on it. I recently picked up smoking an e-cig (not in order to quit, I ""quit"" long before I considered vaping) as a more recreational thing because there are a ridiculous amount of nice flavors and I can do it in-doors. "
"I tried to quit for many years using many methods. In the end it was actually very easy to quit cold turkey. Just think about it this way:
You are always going to want to smoke but its important to keep choosing no. To start with this will happen quite a lot (choosing no) but will become less frequent as time passes. 5 years after stopping I still had to choose no, when I occasionally had a craving out of the blue. 
Also, take up running or cycling and challenge yourself to improve. Smoking gets on the way of getting faster / fitter so put this in its place. 
Stay strong, its really not that bad. "
I started SCA Heavy Fighting.  Not being able to keep up with kids 10 years younger than me motivated me to kick the habit.  I did and now I'm in the best shape of my life.  
"My room mate did it with chantix and the will to quit. She'd had enough of it i think and I prodded a little when I met her, but not too much cuz it doesn't really bother me what other people choose to do with their bodies. But she did it and has been a year and .. probably going on two years smoke free now. She said Chantix gave her wicked weird/vivid dreams/bordering on nightmares, though, so it was wonky for a while."
"eCigarettes. 
Tried cold turkey, tried gum. Never tried patches because they're expensive.
I smoked 10-20 a day for a decade, bought an e-cig and haven't smoked 'properly' since - I had a drag of my girlfriends when I was drunk and hated it. "
"I think it's not so much the method but the motivation. You have to really, really want to quit. You have to convince yourself that it's not pleasurable or desirable, and I mean really. You can't want to quit because ""well, I know it's bad for me"" and yadda yadda. You have to be disgusted by cigarettes, you have to convince yourself that you hate the taste and the feeling and everything about it. And why would you continue to do something that you hate? It's strange, the kind of games you can play with your own brain to convince it that things are true, but that's kind of what I had to do. Your mileage may vary."
"I kept hearing about people dying of throat cancer. George Harrison's (Beatle George) death finally convinced me.. too many people dying from this (and other diseases caused by smoking). I quit cold turkey. Had trouble for a while but eventually the withdrawal pressure waned. This was 10+ years ago after smoking 25 years. I'm still smoking occasionally in my dreams (couple of times a year). In fact, there's a dresser drawer in one of my dreams that has a pack in it. I've been there in more than one dream. You will get through it. Tough for a few weeks, perhaps a month or more, but it WILL pass. Best of luck..."
"Maybe I'm a little bit late to the show:
I started smoking when I was about 15-16 and did it for 4 years.
What I did to quit was to trick my body to accept a substitute for smoking that was less severe.
Basically, 3 times a day I would have myself a cup of coffee and when I had finished it, I would light 1 cigarette and finish half of it.
Then for the second week I would finish 1/4th after each cup.
Then after the second week, when I had associated coffee with minor nicotine relief, I would have myself a cup of coffe when I felt the urge.
I got pissy for three days and after that I just silently and contently had myself a cup.
Then to stop drinking coffee I swapped it out with tea.

This doesn't make you addiction free, this just makes you addicted to something better I suppose. I couldn't live without waking up with tea in the morning and midday and at 4."
"cold turkey, or, just not physically being able to smoke anymore, i had only smoked for 4 years, but i had come to a point where i would get half way through a cigarette and i just stopped half way through a pack, threw it out, and quit...."
"Well after my first drag I just looked at my friend and asked him: Are you insane there isn't even a kick, no rush no nothing just bad taste and high costs. And that is when I quit smoking."
"Cold turkey.  It's the opposite of drinking too much alcohol...the bad effects come first, and the good effects come later."
"the price.  I could not afford smokes for a long time and just hated paying those prices, so i just quit.  "
"My daughter came home from school and said. ""If you don't stop smoking you will die. Don't you want to be alive to see me grow up?"" I have not smoked since that day. No gum no patch nothing. I think you just have to really want to stop. that was 7 years ago."
"Vaping. Nothing else helped me, not patches, not cold turkey, not 'cutting down'. But switching to electronic is working out perfectly. Mind you, you need to invest a little bit into quality equipment and e-liquid. I started of with a CE4 and 24mg liquid, right now i'm down to 12mg."

ITT: Cold turkey.
"I'm in the process of quitting now (was my New Year's resolution), so I can tell you what's working for me:
CHANTIX
Really, that's the biggest key for my efforts as it stops me from gaining any satisfaction from a cigarette - even if/when I do cheat and smoke.  It makes them taste bad, and there's no ""Ahhhhhh"" factor anymore.  From what my Dr. has told me, they are seeing over an 80% success rate in Chantix if the person remains on it for 4-6 months.  My plan is to at least give it a full 4 months.  I've semi-successfully used Chantix in the past but only stayed on it for 2 months which ended up in me smoking again.  Plus I really wasn't quite ready back then.
The biggest problems I run into are continual triggers and just breaking the ""habitual routine"" part since Chantix is taking care of the actual need.
I'm only 3 weeks into the process (which means 2 since my quit date), but I'm finally starting to notice a decrease in the desires when I do get triggered.  I still haven't really found a replacement for all those times throughout the day where I'm used to having a smoke break, but I'm beginning to notice that those times come and go without quite as much notice now.
In the end, it's really not easy - even with medication.  My quit coach told me when I'm fighting that urge to remind myself why I'm doing this.  At first that seemed a little silly, but now it's starting to actually work for me.  My 2 main driving reasons are my kids, and the money I'm saving.  Granted, I'm on a pretty short reward system right now for the money (hey, I can buy X for myself because I already saved this much $) but I really do think that's an important aspect - at least for me.
What works for you will ultimately be a combination of your own priorities and what triggers your personal drive.  I would absolutely recommend some kind of way to reward yourself for the efforts though because I do know that can and will become a huge driving force in itself.  It doesn't necessarily have to involve buying something, but reinforcing good behavior in some kind of way (particularly if you can make it structured on a sliding schedule) really helps a lot!
GOOD LUCK, I really hope you find your way to succeed.  Just remember, the 3rd Marlboro Man just recently died - and that's the role model the industry sets for us."
"Cold turkey and willpower. Now I can't STAND second hand smoke. And I smoked for 10 years.  
  
It took me about 3 years off and on to quit smoking. At first I just started smoking later and later in the day (no cig with morning coffee was the hardest part) and eventually I was able to only smoke in the evenings and then just one before going to bed. At that point, I had just about quit and it took me a while to actually break that last one before bed ritual.  
  
Also, it helps to live in a cold area and only allow yourself to smoke outside, even in the winter, even if all your friends are smoking inside."
"My mum smoked from 13 until she was 29. It was love for my dad that made her quit. 
She told me that when she realised she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him, and that her habit meant they wouldn't get as many years together, she quit cold turkey and never looked back. 
My parents are still happily married and now in their mid fifties."
"It's all mental. It's really fucking hard but you don't NEED anything except will power.  If someone said they would pay you a million dollars to quit for a week, I guarantee you wouldn't give in to the craving. "

""">  Did that twice and it worked both of the times.""
Uhm,, seems to me it only worked once if you actually did it twice. 
"
"I started smoking cigarettes when I was about seventeen, and a year or so later, in college is when i quit. so I didn't smoke for very long.
I had gone to this relaxation seminar at my school; we did meditation, tai chi, and drank some tea. There was also a health counselor there giving neck rubs. While she was rubbing my neck, she was also giving me reiki (energy healing). She held her hands in front of my face for a few seconds and then asked me, ""So when are you going to quit smoking?""
That really freaked me out because I hadn't smoked at all that day and had never met this woman, so she had no physical indication that I was a smoker. She could feel it on an energetic level. I said, ""I guess today"" and haven't had a cigarette since."
I failed at least 50 times and thought I would never kick the habit. Just keep trying. Smoke free for a year now. 
"I guess the straightforward answer would be the GUM but it comes down to more than that for me.
I had a little pressure from the new company I started working at.
Plus moving to a small progressive city where very few people smoked has certainly helped. I guess not seeing people smoke when you are trying to quit helps because you just think about smoking less. Also I used to have friends that smoked and quitting while hanging out with them was nearly impossible. Now none of the friends I have smoke and I think they all look down on it a little, so stepping out for a cig really made me feel a little embarrassed.
Also I have became very interested in rock climbing and hiking and in order to make noticeable progress I had to get more into shape and after a while I could see that smoking was a hinderance. I am very competitive so I took training and conditioning seriously enough to also make me think about quitting.
All of those things combine were enough to help me quit and stay quit"
"Ive smoked for 4 years.. How did I quit? I thought of my life and how my insides would look if I continue. Also, imagine getting Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Terrifying. I want to live longer and feel better, simple as that. If you cant hold urself then ur NOT trying hard enough. You wont feel well, ofc.. But just take a straw and breath through it, you want that.. or do you want to due a terrible death..? Think."
"I smoked 20 to 30 cigarettes a day for a few years.  I got a really bad case of bronchitis and I got sick and tired of being sick and tired.  After that I cut back to about 5 to 10 per day, and I found that there was an negative relationship between number of cigarettes smoked at parties and both the quantity and quality of sexual encounters resulting from said parties.  That sealed the deal, and I haven't wanted a cigarette in almost two years."
"I quit on 1/1/2013.
I smoked for about 16 years (half my life at the time) and about 1 pack a day.  My wife was disgusted with it, and I did my best to hide if from her.  
Finally I promised to quit.  I got Chantix from my dr.  When I started taking the Chantix it seemed like I didn't need to smoke, and just continued to do it out of habit.  As the quit time approached I was confident.  That day was HELL!  I could not sit still.  
I downloaded an app on my phone called cessation nation.  This helped me as I could see how much money I was saving.  Still every morning for about 100 days I was craving.  But after that things started to become clear to me that I was not going to smoke.  
Now the smell makes me sick to my stomach.  I don't even like to sit next to someone who smokes because of the awful smell.  The thought of having just one cigarette now is repulsive to me."
"I have quit 2 times seriously (the second seems to be sticking). I say I quit once before because I went 9 months without smoking and didn't feel the need anymore. My downfall was getting piss drunk and thinking ... ohh its ok to just have one.
I quit the first time with chantix, which was wonderful. The reason I didn't go back to it was that it gave me fucked up dreams (like really fucked up). Other than that it was a good experience, take the pill and smoking isn't even enjoyable anymore. That meant that the two times I broke down and had a smoke I got some negative reinforcement.
This time I used e cigs to take the edge of for the first 2 weeks and have gone on fine since then.
The main things (no matter what method you choose) you personally need to want to stop smoking. Usually you have a multiple reasons (cost, smell, health). Use those and remind yourself about why smoking sucks every time you think about it. Try to convince you mind that you hate the habit. I hated feeling like it was controlling me.
The things that help a lot are exercise and support from people (and by support that meant people I didn't want to disappoint by failing). I tried the whole oral fixation thing 1st time around and chewed a ton of gum. I don't think it helped and now I chew gum religiously.
Since you have tried numerous times, try to figure out what keeps causing you to fail. And lastly remember that most people require multiple attempt to successfully quit. Keep you head up."
"There is a medicine that takes the lust away.
Pop the pills for 7 days and you simply lose the urge to smoke. Then stay smoke free for a month. It becomes easier after that."
Canadian Winter
After trying several times to quit and failing I finally quit by being determined to not stop quiting.  If I gave in and had a smoke I'd just throw a patch back on and start again.  Eventually I just wore myself down.  I also had to write a note to myself that said no matter what I thought ever I could never put a ciggarette to my lips again with out being hooked.  Its been 14 years and haven't slipped yet but I still dream that I started smoking again and it takes me a while in the am to realize it was a dream and shake off the self disappointment. 
My grandma use to smoke 2 packs a day and when i was younger the doctor told her I have asthma. She instantly stopped and never smoked again
e-cigs
"I took Chantix for a month and it worked for me.  I was at about 5 packs per week and now I haven't had a cig in just over a year.
It really messed with my sleep cycle and I was irritable for a few months after I stopped taking it.  You need to REALLY WANT to quit.  You can't just think that you want to, you need to commit to it.  There will be hiccups, but you can't allow those to spiral into buying packs again."
"I chose a date my birthday then purchased 2 weeks worth of patches. I used up the patches for the two weeks then was too cheap to buy more so stopped using that also. Almost a Month to the quit day it was New Years so decided to see what I was
Missing. I tried to smoke one but on the first
Puff it was so disgusting, never again.
All to impress some cunt, I guess have to thank her for the motivation."
"I haven't had a cigarette in about four months thanks to using an e-cigarette/vaporizer.  I'm now almost to a point where I'm done using the e-cig as well (I started at 18mg nicotine and I've tapered it down to 6mg).
If cold turkey, patches, and gum aren't for you, I'd give it a shot.  The start-up costs can be a little high depending on which brand you get, but it's still much cheaper for you if you're a pack-a-day smoker."
I quit after God addressed me directly and told me to.
Pretty much when my dad died from lung cancer
"One box of nicorette, then changed out for trident original. Was my fourthtry. What I was told a lot and never believed was true ended up being truth. You'll only be sucessful if you truly want to quit."
"Been on the 4mg Nicorrette Lozenge now for two years now. I have not smoked once. As a fyi, a cigarette has about 18 mg of nicotine and the e-cigs nicotine can be as high as 18 also. I don't think much of the e-cigs as their are most likely Chinese companies churning those out and the nicotine that they make may be suspect as in uncontrolled properties. Whatever works for you - cig smoking kills and it is killing me, years of smoking...."
Commitment.
I've quit using the patch at least 4 times now. I am actually on my last day of the patch today. Now if I could just quit starting smoking. 
"I started exercising. Specifically running for short distance speed (1 mile or less as fast as possible, my goal was a sub 6 minute mile and a sub 1 minute quarter mile). Once I started feeling the tightness in my chest and the crappyness of my lungs I didn't want to smoke any more. "
"The only way to quit smoking is if you really want to quit.
The idea of quitting came after smoking for 15 years. Suddenly I realized that I started to felt disgusted by the other smokers being a smoker myself.
One day I had my wisdom tooth extracted and the dentist said that I couldnt smoke for 2 days.
I took that oportunity and never smoked again."
"Quitting smoking is like losing weight. We all are looking for a system or strategy, but there's no trick other than just to do it. To lose weight, you have to diet and exercise. To quit smoking, you just have to force yourself to stop smoking. It's a brutal few weeks, but you have no one but yourself to blame for getting addicted in the first place. I quit from a pack a day habit about two years ago, and I still get the occasional craving when I drink wine, but once the addiction is physically out of you, it's easier to handle. "
Probably not helpful for OP but I quit cold turkey because I was flat broke and didn't have enough money to buy a pack of cigarettes
"I started on a blu e-cig out of desperation to quit. Then when those weren't enough, I switched to a proper e cig (vamo w/ a kanger pro tank). 10 months into that, I got sick and couldn't even vape. I had weened my nic intake over the previous year, and am now better and I haven't picked up my mod to vape yet. Going to see how long I can keep this streak.
But that's me. I hope you find something that works for you."
I really wanted to date a girl who I knew didn't like smokers.  Decided to quite cold turkey and we dated. In time she became my wife.  Haven't regretted it one bit
"Cold turkey combined with cardio exercise. The exercise keeps you busy (I mostly smoked because I was bored or not moving much) and after a couple of runs/swims/bike rides, you'll realize how much smoking was really hurting you.
Also the natural high from cardio workouts serves as a good replacement to a nicotine buzz."
"A promise to my girlfriend. It's nothing she made me do or anything, in fact it was entirely my idea. I just knew that if I promised her I wouldn't smoke any more I'd actually hold to it more tightly. I had wanted to quit for a long time and had been ramping down my intake for over a year - I was down to around 2-4 cigarettes a day at most before I went cold turkey.
I guess if you give in and go back on a private promise to yourself it's not usually seen as that bad, but not wanting to break a promise to someone you love can be motivating."
"I stopped for a year, cold turkey.  I told myself that I could smoke again next year.  I did, but not as much.  The following year was no smoking again.  The year after that, I never bothered to start back up.  They say it takes an average of seventeen attempts to succeed at quitting.  I personally believe that the habit is harder to break than the addiction.  Perhaps restructure your trigger situations..."
"I just stopped buying them.
I know that won't cut it for most people, but it worked easily for me. After 2-3 days I never craved one unless I was drinking."
"I did a week on the patch and went cold turkey. I just had my 35th birthday and was having more and more issues with coughing and being easily winded. I think I tried hundreds of other times before but succeded this time because I really set my mind to it. It took 4 months to stop craving nicotine and in that time the longer I was free of it, the easier it was to say, ""if I go back to them now I have to start this all over again"". At about two weeks in telling myself that helped. It really boils down to if you are really ready to give it up and accept you will be going through a rough couple months of withdrawals. Also, stay busy. It really helped me. I will have 4 years free in September. Good luck"

"I took it hour by hour by telling myself ""I lasted this hour, so i will manage the next one also""
"
"I still smoke a few cigarettes a month, but the most effective thing for me so far has been an ecig. Been drastically cut back for about 6 months now and figure I will be completely done in a month or two. "
"I know I am late to this thread. Saw it on the front page.
But, for what it's worth, here is my story.
I smoked for 5 years. Was up to almost 2 packs a day towards the end. I was very conscious about not trying to quit unless my heart was really in it. Had one failed quit attempt before.
Here is how I circumvented my brain:
I picked a quit date, and *did not tell anyone*. I feel that not telling anyone was an important part. Then I smoked super-hard for about a week. When I'd smoke too much, I would get gaggy and nauseated. I would then tell myself to remember this feeling.
On the quit date I went and got my first tattoo. I know this wouldn't work for everyone. I've been meaning to get a tattoo for a while, so it wasn't entirely and solely for quitting tabacco. But I did time getting the tattoo with the quit date, and mentally assigned the meaning to the tattoo. I think this probably helped me the most. I knew that I'd feel like an idiot with a permanent mark on my body that has had its meaning voided.
Early after quitting I had a dream that I lit up, and I got really sad about it. Almost to the point of tears. When I woke up, it took me a little while to realize that it was only a dream, and I didn't violate my deal. A book I read on quitting said that the craving for the cigarette will pass within a few minutes *regardless* if you smoke one or not. So no single cigarette craving has been enough for me to go back on my decision.
I also chewed nicotine gum for a couple of weeks. It gave me terrible heartburn, so I did not re-up after finishing the initial pack. I know, some people get hooked on the gum. Thankfully, it wasn't an option for me.
It's been 4 years, and I couldn't be happier about my decision and execution. That year I met a girl who I ended up marrying and we now have a beautiful baby girl. That would not have happened had I still been a smoker. My wife loves tattoos and hates cigarettes. Also, I'm attempting my 1st full marathon this Sunday.
TL;DR: I picked a date, didn't tell anyone. Smoked *a lot* leading up to the quit date, bottled the feeling of nausea for later reference. Then on quit date got a tattoo commemorating my decision, which sealed the deal. Chewed nicotine gum for a bit to ease the transition.
*edit* grammar"
"What worked for me is I made a rule that I could never ever have a pack (or individual) inside my house (I don't have the opportunity to store any at work and I don't smoke in my car, so effectively this meant I could never own a pack).  The only way I could smoke then was bumming from friends or paying the bathroom guy a buck for a cig out at the bar.  So I would still smoke occasionally, but you don't want to bum from your friends for long, and you don't go out drinking every night.
I smoked the most in my garage when I got stressed at home.  I was in college at the time so finals weeks or gaming with room mates were huge triggers for smoking a ton.  Not having a pack in the house eliminated that, and got me to a point where I rarely smoke now.  I'll still have a cig or two on some nights when I go out, but it's maybe twice a month at the most, and for me that works and I'm ok with it."
"I switched to chantex plus e-cig plus chew. Then stopped the chantex, followed by the e-cig. I still chew occasionally. One tin usually lasts me a month. Better than the 1.5 to 2 packs a day I was at. "
"Persistence. I agree cold turkey is what really works but don't think you are going to get it right he first time. I tried to quit 40 or 50 times before I got it right. Some attempts lasted a few hours, others a days, some weeks, some lasted a few months. I once quit for 15 months but then started smoking again. I finally quit because smoking had taken over my life. I've now quit for 16 years. Keep trying!"
"smoked for 15 years and quit cold turkey, i wasn't feeling very well and the cigs were tasting nasty with the cold i had. So i guess i was just sick of feeling even worse with common colds idk lol"
Honestly marijuana was the easiest way for me. Cigarettes weren't nearly as good when I was high and cold turkey never really worked for me. To make a long story short eventually it had been 2 months since I smoked a cigarette and by then I couldn't stand the smell or taste of one.
"The patch, and really wanting to quit."
"My maternal father and I both quit at the same time. About 2 weeks in he started smoking again. I went over to visit one day and he told me ""you'll never quit"". It's been 6 years this month..."
I had to surround myself with people who didn't smoke.  It's very effective to find someone who cares about you who also happens to HATE cigs. that combo is what finally kicked it for me.
crossfit and snus and allowing to have myself a cig when drinking
7 failed attempts.  
"Chantix... and not drinking.
Chantix did the trick for . Smoker for 12 years. Quit in a week and  a half. But nothing goes better with a beer than a cigarette, so I had to quit drinking until  I was sure I wouldn't light up."
just never got up to go buy anymore.
"This will probably sound really weird and oddball.
But switch to tobacco snuff. Like, the kind that goes up your nose. Specifically, the lime flavor works the best.
Anywho, if your a normal person you probably wont like having to sniff ground tabacco to get your nicotine fix. So youll only do it when you need it, and eventually you just do less and less and less and your like, nah I don't think I need to put anything up my nose today."
"I used to always joke, ""Quitting is easy! I've done it hundreds of times!"" But what finally got me to give it up for good was having a kid. It's been almost 3 years now since the birth of my first son and I've never so much as had a single puff. (I obviously realize this isn't much help to many of you!)"
"I smoked a pack a day or more for about 6 or 7 years. I tried to quit a few times, but what eventually worked was taking a few cigarettes out of the pack each time and throwing them away. One at first, then two, then three, etc.
After I got down to about 10 in a pack, meaning I had cut my intake in half, I started smoking only when I drank. 
One big tip: don't beat yourself up over a ""relapse."" It will happen. And each time you can remind yourself that this isn't what you want to do. Gradually the addiction weakens.
Another thing which helped is I had a coworker who would let me pay him for cigarettes. I think I did this during my ""drinking only"" phase. If I wanted to smoke at work, I gave him 50 cents or a dollar or whatever. 
Haven't smoked in like 6 years or so I think. I lost track. No desire whatsoever at this point. "
Ecigs worked fine for me but then again...I work at an ecig shop lol
"I smoked for 20 years. 
Unlearn the lies. Smoking isn't sexy, tasty, cool, relaxing, soothing, stress reliving. Blah blah blah. 
It stinks, hurts, tastes like shit and is killing you. Figure out your triggers and stressors, anticipate them. I was a RRT, I remember the smoke break. I have kept that break, I just lost the cigarettes.
Also, you didn't fail at quitting smoking, you quit for a while. Every reduction is a success, every cigarette not smoked is a victory.
It really is about your perceptions and habits. Both are very hard to change. You are not weak because you failed, you instead have learned more about your habit. Try again. It is just like learning anything, you will keep failing at it until you don't. It is worth it.
I quit 5 years ago, I can smoke a cigarette today and it grosses me out, I put it out and don't crave them. How the hell did I smoke 160,000+ of those nasty things? I programmed myself to do it. It is a learned habit. You can unlearn it, but the fundamental assumptions have to be challenged.
Being smoke free is one of my favorite things I have done for myself. I love it. Not being R J Morris's slave rules.
Now, get back to learning how to not smoke, you got this."
"One day, I just stopped smoking. I know that's not that easy for some people, but I simply found other things to fill my time until I was too busy and just forgot to smoke a cigarette. I was working a lot, hanging out with friends (who DIDN'T smoke, big help), and I just was so full of stuff to do that by the time I did have time for a smoke, I was too tired and just wanted to go to bed.  Seriously FUCK smoking and FUCK anyone who thinks they can't quit because you're WRONG AS FUCK. Smoking is a big. fat. SCAM. It's the biggest scam that has ever been. 
1. Get you hooked by making it look ""cool""
2. You become addicted to something that tastes and smells like ass
3. You taste and smell like ass
4. You continue to SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT SMELLS AND TASTES LIKE ASS
5. They profit and you die. 
QUIT BEING A DUMBASS AND STOP SMOKING YOU MORON ."
"I decided to quit more than five years before I actually quit.  I told myself, ""You can't be a 40-year-old smoker, that's when shit starts going downhill"" when I was about 35 and thought I'd be smoking until I died.
Every year that passed, I'd have it in the back of my mind, ""You're going to be a nonsmoker in a couple of years, enjoy it while you can!""
Then the fateful year arrived.  Then the last month.  But I'd been getting ready for ages, you see?  Everyone knew I was going to be a nonsmoker, even me.  I'd prepared some of those Nicorette things for the cravings.
So when I put that last cigarette out I was well prepared.  There was never any real doubt.  I haven't had one since, even though I still love the smell, and miss the rush...best of luck to you OP."
"I quit cold turkey time to time. Smoke for a few weeks then not the next. Your body gets used to the ups and downs and forgets about needing it and just enjoying it. 
Maybe I'm not addicted yet (been smoking for ~5 years) never been more than 1/2 a pack in a day unless going to a show or drinking a lot. Usually have 4-5 of them a day.
Am I just weird or do other people ""want"" them and not feel physically addicted? I'm mentally addicted to the relaxation 100% though, when I'm stressed one thing is for sure: I need a damn cig.  "
"This is a shitty answer but is the truth : I got a concision. Out of nowhere I fainted (assuming this was blood sugar related) and I hit my head bad. I quit with in a week of that. Cigarettes just tasted gross afterwards. I also quit drinking in excess post concussion. Probably dangerous, but worth it."
"I caught a really bad stomach virus that had me bed ridden for 3 days. During this time I wasn't able to smoke. I had always heard that the hardest part of quitting is the first few days, so I thought since I had already made it that far, I would see if I could make it further. I actually quit cold turkey this way."
"I got hospitalized and was very sick for a week. I couldn't get up or go anywhere. To my surprise I actually never thought about smoking the entire time. I guess it was because of the pain or something like that.
I after I hadn't smoked for a week and when a doctor asked me if I smoked that was when I realized that I hadn't smoked the entire time I was there and yes I suddently felt the urge to smoke but to my surprise I told the doctor that I was no longer a smoker. And I actually have never smoked since then.
And the best part about not being a smoker anymore is that my son doesn't remember me being a smoker and he really looks up to me. (c;"
"I was in prison and smoking regularly; At my parole hearing they told me they'd let me out if I completed a drug program. I went into the drug program the same day and knew I couldn't get away with any shenanigans. I quit February 19th of last year, got out in November, haven't smoked or drank at all.
EDIT: cold turkey."
"I gradually reduced my consumption from full, half, etc. over time I just didn't care for it much anymore. "
"Fucken nothing!!! 
Insanity wolf yourself into the abyss of no smoking!!!!!!"
"Pure unadulterated will power. You have to make the decision to do it and stick to it. Nothing else works, you have to visualize a healthier life and follow through. "
Scuba certification did it for me.  The first few times diving I focused so much on my breathing.  I really noticed how heavy it was which in turn meant sucking down the air and having to go up much faster than anyone else. This was the deciding factor and I just quit cold turkey.  I also stopped drinking for a while so that I didn't want the smoke with booze.
"[This is one of the powerful anti-ad video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO0qwl5k9R4)
No..evidently it didn't stop me.. :( but gotta admit that it touched me.
Maybe If I experience it firsthand..want to feel it like being without agenda or manipulation."
"What worked for me:
* Give up when you get ill. Rather than having a 'last cigarette' i gave up when I got a chest infection and couldn't smoke for a few days, and a friend mentioned that since i hadn't smoked for a few days, why start again? Giving up by not realising you started to give up was a good way to go, and when you can;t smoke because you would cough for 10 mins it is easier to stop yourself lighting up. 
* Cold turkey - the easy bit of getting off cigarettes is the nicotine, the social part is much harder. Why make this go on longer with patches, sprays with e-cigs?
* Do it when you want to. You can't be forced or cajoled, you have to actually be personally committed. "
"I bought a new car.  
95% of the cigarettes I smoked were while in transit, and I didn't want my new car to smell or have little burn marks.  "
"Stopped smoking by starting dipping.
Not the ideal way to do it..."
"I smoked my brother's preferred blend (Reds) instead of my 27's, and thought it tasted disgusting. That's when I realized: fuck, dude ALL cigarettes are disgusting. I was tricking myself into actually thinking one tasted better than the other. They're just all gross to me ever since then. It's gross to think about now, and smelling someone else's smoke makes me nauseous. Just had an eye opener, I guess.
I'll have a cigar maybe once a month, but I used to be a chain smoker, and have only smoked once since Thanksgiving. 
"
"I smoked for about 6 years before this occurred.
I got a stomach virus and was really nauseated for a while...I couldn't even smell the smoke without wanting to vomit. I didn't have a cigarette for about 2 weeks because of this. After that I figured I could make it to 1 month...then 2, 3...eventually the cravings subsided. It's been almost 3 years since I've quit.
Far too often, people lie to themselves.
You have to really want to quit...when you have the resolve, set short goals and commit to them. Good luck! "
"Well im currently about 9 days in Cold turkey and well so far so good. First three days were fucked. Also I still cant sleep a solid night but im over the intense cravings.
I guess genuinely wanting  to quit is the biggest motivation."
"Smoked for a few years, then just decided it was gross and not doing anything for me so I just stopped."
I decided to stop smoking so I stopped. 
"After 5 times I have to ask if you actually want to quit? Seriously, being nagged into it by someone else isn't the incentive that will make you stop, without making the decision yourself you will (almost) always fail.
1) You need to *REALLY* want to give up. The catalyst for me was my son, then 2 years old, had developed a cough because I was smoking. At that point massive guilt made the decision for me.
2) Just stop. Don't ""cut down a bit"" don't replace cigarettes with something else like a patch, just stop. Two weeks of hell followed by a lifetime of 'meh..' It really is that simple.
3) Give yourself a tangible reward. Every morning take the cash you would have used to buy cigarettes and drop it in a big jar, you'll be amazed at how quickly it mounts up. Once you can actually see the reward for quitting you can start planning how many more smoke free days until [insert reward here] Could be a holiday, could be a new TV, if you're a heavy smoker it could be a new car. A good friend of mine followed this advice and after 4 months took his wife to Japan for a three week vacation.
20+ years a non-smoker now and I've never wanted to start again."
"kinda like you don't ween yourself off of heroin, you don't ween yourself off smoking. cold turkey is the best way."
"I quit smoking. Smoked from 14 to 21 woke up one day, realized I didn't want cancer so I threw a half pack away and haven't smoked since. Just quit smoking, you don't need to spend money on a bunch of bullshit, just have self control, and take responsibility for yourself. "
"I've tried almost everything to quit, but I didn't like the cold turkey process. So I tried chantix, which worked really well. It allowed me to ween off and at the same time contemplate why I was smoking. I was also a heavy non-filter smoker."
"For me, i decided to give up smoking for lent. I bought a 5lb bag of dum-dums because i wanted to try that method out. So whenever i had a craving i just grabbed a lollipop. This worked for a while until my teeth and gums felt sore and i felt like i was getting cavities (~2 weeks). After that i started smoking again but noticed i didnt have as many cravings as before. Around October of 2012, i was introduced to vaping by a friend and i picked up one for myself which, i feel, finally helped me kick the habit. I havent had a real cigarette since then.
Tl;dr: dum-dums and vaping "
"I used an e-cig to kick the tobacco habbit. Six months later I decided I was over being a slave to nicotine and decided to go cold turkey. I locked myself in my room over memorial day weekend and proceeded to be the biggest douchey dick in the history of mankind. The simple realization that nicotine could have that much of an affect on my personality has made me not want to go back. The want never fully goes away, to this day if I catch whiff of my favorite brand I have a fleeding thought of tackeling said person and smoking that damn thing to the filter. "
"I had 3 failed quits after about 7 months. Always hoped that I could be one of those people that smoke when they drink. Inevitably led back to me smoking. I have used the patch several times and it really helped me get past the jonesing. I'm almost to 2 years smoke free now. The difference this time is that I just decided I was done. No cheating smokes. No electronic smokes. Nearly 2 years later and I don't even think about smoking, and I smoked for 20 years. Good luck!"
"Cold turkey, but cold turkey NOW. Not tomorrow or next week. I see people saying they set a date but I definitely couldn't have done it that way because I would have always put it off. Try not to think about how this will be the last cigarette you ever smoke. Just think about today. Today you will not smoke. Then tomorrow will be today and you worry about not smoking again. 
You can't avoid work obviously so do something instead when you take a break like get some water from the cooler or whatever. But definitely avoid alcohol for a very long time if you are truly serious about quitting because you WILL smoke when you drink (I would even usually just buy a whole pack and be left to smoke it and then I would tell myself I would ""quit after this pack""). 
If you slip up and smoke (which you probably will) don't think of it as a failure where you have to start all over but just realize that it is a process and don't start smoking again thinking it is a lost cause. Just focus on not smoking the next cigarette. 
Also I find counting the days counterproductive because, while it does give you something to feel good about (""It's been 3 weeks, pretty good, right?""), it will give you something to feel bad about if you slip up and make you feel as if you are starting over which isn't the case at all. It also makes you focus o smoking in a roundabout way because you are thinking about the days that you have gone without smoking.
Oh, and exercise and don't keep cigarettes around. Toss 'em.. But there's no ""solution."" You know what you have to do: you have to quit. It's just really, really hard. It's all about when you convince yourself that ""Fuck it, I'll have one"" and then talk yourself back off the ledge.
Try to remember how utterly disgusting and unhealthy that shit is. The effects are immediate too, not just ""cancer when you're 70."" You can't breathe for shit and because of that you're probably out of shape (unless you're one of these freaks I see every now and then). 
There are no tricks. Just rough times ahead that you already know will be worth it."
"I used Chantix.  But, I feel the more important part was getting the mindset that you can never have another cigarette again in your life.  I also accepted that fact that if I continued to smoke it was going to kill me sooner than anything else in my life."
"Not me, but Mom. She quit cold turkey after her doc told her she had early stages of emphysema. Smoking 2-3 packs/day for 50yrs had finally caught up to her. This was 10yrs ago. She beat breast cancer a few years ago only to succumb to lung cancer last year. The last 6mo of her life  were a nightmare. I had moved her in with my wife and I because she could no longer live on her own. Any physical exertion caused her to gasp for air, including getting out of bed to sit on her portable toilet that was 1ft away. Now anytime I see a young person smoking I think to myself, ""WTF are you doing stufa(stupid fuck)"""
"Went to Afghanistan where butts were 4 dollars a carton. When I got home tax brought Newports to $10.30 a pack. Fuck that, I don't need to smoke that bad.  I don't get how homeless people and drug addicts can afford to smoke these days."
I have stopped after using nicotine lozenges. Chewing them has replaced the 'need to do something' as well as providing nicotine.
Personally an E-cig worked for me. I don't know if you can consider that quitting since you still have a nicotine habit as long as you keep using the E-cig but it's definitely a hell of a lot better for your health than cigarettes.
Some Columbian nose-candy
"Cold turkey, and a reason, you have to want it, I smoked for damn near ten years and decided I was DONE and I smoked my last cig and spent the next three weeks in hell on earth, there is no sugar coating here it sucks, however I've been smoke free for almost three years now, would not change for the world, I can breathe, I don't get sick hardly at all, it's amazing, but you need that reason, for me I wanted better for myself, and then about six months in I met the love of my life who is deathly allergic to cigarette smoke, so that helps a little bit lol"
"Snus dude. Snus is the shit. Go and fetch in Sweden, it will work wonders for you."
The recent bouts of cold weather in the Midwest have beaten the urge to smoke for me.
"wife said stop, or I will divorce you."
"The Patch.  Follow the instructions. Do not leave it on when you sleep. Drink TONS of water. 
Do step 1 until you think it's time to take it down to step 2 (Should be maybe 1-3 weeks).  If you go to step 2 and need to go back to step 1, no worries, take your time.  
Go down to step 3 once you feel you are ready (Should be 4-7 weeks), and again take your time.  Here is where you have all the time in the world.  By this time you should be out of the habit of having a smoke after meals, while drinking coffee, while drinking alcohol, after smoking a joint, etc.  Stay on step 3 for as long as you feel comfortable.  If you take it off for a couple days and feel that you are having cravings, put that shit back on.  Ween yourself off of it.
I am not saying this will work for everyone, but it definitely worked for me."
"Cold turkey by far is the best way. After a couple weeks the Nicotine has left your system and the cravings are pretty much gone.
But for me what worked, I got an e-cig (the one you fill up with liquid), had nicotine for one week, then I got one that was a shisha flavour (0mg nicotine) used that for a few months, then just wasnt bothered to smoke in general. Been off for ages now, a few friends of mine have had the same work for them"
Chest pain + cold turkey.  Smoked 1.5 packs for about 10 yrs.
"Three bouts of pneumonia in one winter. Could barely eat and breathe (was panting more than breathing), and the ER still just shrugged and sent me home that one night I began hallucinating while puking lung-phlegm into the toilet bowl. Figured I'd better do something about it since nobody else would, and its easy enough to quit smoking once breathing turns into panting.   
The only trick I've needed was one that could help me deal with the typical social habits of a smoker, luckily I'd just started at a place where I was the only smoker which suddenly made those smoke breaks really antisocial - I replaced smoke breaks and 'the motions' with water bottle refill breaks and group excursions to the water fountain - I sip from the bottle just like I'd take a drag from a smoke, and with the same frequency (apparently my constant cap-removing and replacing on the water bottle has completely filled the gap left by cigarettes and can annoy my surroundings just the same)."
"Nicotine Lozenges.  Walgreens has them ~25% cheaper than Nicorette brand.
I can control my own dosage, taking them after a meal or when I'm stressed.  It's a very similar experience to using snus tobacco.
Nowadays I maybe have 1 smoke a week and afterwards I feel shitty and go back to the lozenges.  I might have 2 smokes during a party like new years.
I haven't kicked the addiction, I've just replaced it with something less cancerous.  Been like this for almost 6 months."
I decided I would rather play soccer than smoke. My SO was also pretty upset that I started again and making her cry isn't a top priority of mine. Cold turkey worked for me. I would do some push ups every time I wanted a smoke. Worked well.
Chantix. Smoker for 10+ years and have quit for 6 years.
"I quit 4 years ago, did it cold turkey. Was a pack and half a day smoker got 11 years. I would say that you have to want to not smoke any more. You cant think of it as ""Quiting"". And if its work that making it hard for you than take a No Smoking holiday. Take a couple days off and quit the night before your days off. The first 3 days are the hardest I found. I coudnt concentrate. What ever you do, just remember, ""It gets easier everyday"". Good Luck"
"Cold turkey.
I had an epiphany about how terrible smoking actually was for me after walking up my stairs and being completely out of breath (at the time I was 19, 6'3"", and 165 lbs). so I decided right then and there that the cigs I had were my last (despite it not being a full pack). It's been almost 4 years now since I had a cigarette.
After many failed attempts (and watching my friends repeatedly fail to quit) I've realized that you can't quit by convincing yourself that you want to; you actually have to want to quit. That means you can't make excuses like ""I'll only smoke when I'm drunk"", or ""I won't buy anymore packs"", because eventually you **will** start smoking again. 
I would suggest sitting down and really think about whether you want to quit or not. If you decide you're ready to quit then pick a day that you're going to stop and commit to it, no excuses."
I used electronic cigarettes. I haven't smoked in 6 months. Vaping may not be FDA approved but since I started I can run and exercise like I had never smoked.
"as \u\kirkirus said, going cold turkey is the best way.  To combat the urges I played guitar.  I rarely have before, and never have since, but for 3 days or so whenever I got urges I would play till my fingers hurt.  Find something creative to do to get away from that feeling in your gut.  Eat good, stay with friends, and in a couple days it will pass.  Best of luck to you buddy!   (Also I had quit the job I smoked at before so that was a huge help to me - but im sure you'll find a way.)"
"New friends, new habits. I quit over the course of several years, and it only really stuck when I found myself in an active, non-smoking social circle. If you find you just can't quit, chances are it's because your friends smoke or see you as a smoker. "
"I used an App. I listened to it for two weeks and woke up one morning not wanting my morning smoke.  This was by far the most painless ""trying to quit"" something experience I have ever had. I haven't had a craving in over a year.  Stop Smoking Now by Max K.
-Put your ear buds in, find a quiet spot and wake up 45 min later feeling like you've just slept for a week.  It's amazing,  well worth the 5$ and I have no desire to smoke tobacco."
"I also quit cold turkey, it was the only thing that truly worked. I started smoking at 16 and quit when I was 24. My motivation was wanting to be able to work out and run without feeling like I was dying. "
"reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette 
Smoked for about 4 years, moved to e-cigs, smoked those for... 6-8 months, stopped completely.
Still pick up an e-cig when I know I have to be up all night or when I'm out drinking with friends, but it's way better than burning through half a pack of Camels."
"Cold Turkey and being stubborn. 
Was a smoker for 7-8yrs. Boyfriend of 2yrs doesn't smoke and after a while he stopped asking me to quit. This made me both disappointed in myself and made me feel like he gave up hoping I would quit. Then I was determined to prove to him AND myself that I could do it."
"In my humble opinion, you should start to practice any kind of sport. For me **Fartlek** was helpful."
Grapefruit!
Extreme irritability worked.
"/r/electronic_cigarette
Should be able to guide you. A lot of e-cig converts backslide once or twice until they find their perfect set up and preferred liquid. If the e-cig you have isn't working, it may be that you need to find the right set up that will. 
It seems the only 2 methods with a high success rate are switching to an electronic cigarette or cold turkey. "
Skoal.
"This will obviously be buried and probably down voted to hell, but I smoke weed instead. "
"Willpower. You need to quit for you, not because everyone is nagging you.
I am a singer/songwriter so once my voice started going, so did my will to smoke. I quit cold turkey one day and never went back."
"Snus
Snus is a Swedish tobacco-ware (word for this?) that looks like dirt and smells like heaven. It also comes in small small bags, and you put it under your lip.
It's not good for you, but it's an awful lot healthier than cigarettes. "
"Gum. Smoked for maybe 9 yrs, had quit briefly a few times cold turkey, but the gum really helped me transition for good. Gum and coffee, lots of coffee."
"Finding out we were going to have a child at last, both quit that day over 5 years ago."
"1) Not drinking
2) Not smoking pot
3) Drinking a glass of water when I wanted a cigarette

"My success strategy:
I never ""tried"" to quit.  I smoked with conviction and promised when I did finally attempt to quit I would succeed.  I then gloated that it was going to be super easy to quit to all my friend and co-workers.  All this raised the stakes really really high for the day I would finally quit.
When I decieded to, because my son was on his way, I ordered some champix and pulled out all that gloating, and quit.  It's been just over 2 years and I don't feel like smoking.  If I had known it was going to be that easy I would have quit 10 years earlier.
TLDR: put it all on the line, make backing out super embarrassing, champix works."
will power.
"I didn't buy another packet, haven't smoked for a whole week."
"I tried all the pills, gums, patches etc. Nothing worked. I tried setting a date where I'd be stress free and have days off work etc. Failed.
I decided to quit when during finals week of college while working full time and taking 4 classes. It sucked, but I think the fact that I was so stressed and busy actually helped. 
Also, when I got the urge to smoke I took a nice swig of water and mentally reminded myself 'this urge will pass in a few seconds, not worth giving in. I have this urge 50 times a day but for only a few seconds at a time, don't be a bitch and give in.' and the urge passed a few seconds later. I believe the 1 week mark is when the physical cravings were gone, after that it was breaking the habits of wanting to smoke after eating, while driving etc. Those are much easier habits to break than the first week of physical cravings. Good luck."
"I attached my quitting date with something VERY important (i.e. My wedding day) and stuck with the patch all the way until it said to. 
A lot of people who use the patch, after a few weeks of not smoking, say they're fine now. They stop using the patch and within 2 days they're smoking again. 
Also, replace the smoking with something else. For me it was video games. I started playing a LOT more when I quit. I still find tat when I'm playing games, I don't even think of smoking (or drinking booze for that matter). It doesn't work as well with laid back games like WoW though :p"
Take up running.  
"There is already some really good advice shared by a lot of people. Here is mine:
Remind yourself you have to be tough to quit, that nicotine is more addictive than heroin. When the cravings come, remind yourself you have to be strong to get through them.
Lung cancer usually gets people to quit and death is a surefire way to quit. So you will eventually quit. But tell yourself you should quit short of lung cancer and death.
1. Realize you have the right to smoke if you want to. You also have the right to quit. You need to decide to quit taking your life and start saving your life. 
2. Realize it is you who failed the first five attempts. Don't feel sad about it but do beat yourself up. You failed. You were the problem. Not the stress around you. It was you.
3. Don't do what you did the first five times. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome. Be sane about quitting.
4. Stop using nicotine. No patches, no inhalers, no e-cigs. Quit cold turkey and don't look back. Nicotine replacement is a scam. It's like overweight people replacing sugar with powdered sugar. 
5. When the cravings come, embrace them. Count how long each lasts. Never believe ""it is never going to end"". Time it. It ends. Eventually the cravings last shorter periods and occur further apart.
6. Exercise. Take walks. Relax. Love life. 
 
Think of something to look forward to if you remain smoke free for a week, a month, a year. Reward yourself. Seriously, if you can do it, you deserve it. You are awesome.
This advice is coming from someone who smoked 30 years and was able to quit. I wish you and everyone else trying to quit the best of luck. "
"You have to WANT to quit. Really want to. For years, I told myself I should quit, but really I enjoyed it too much. The habits. 2 failed attempts with gum, patches. It took one winter of constant bronchial infections to finally, truly want to quit. Just went cold turkey, and now I can't even stand second hand smoke."
">what ACTUALLY WORKED to get you to successfully stop smoking?
I stopped putting cigarettes in my mouth and lighting them up.  "
"I quit cold turkey 19 years ago. I quit cold turkey and never missed them. I never had even one craving after smoking for 18 years. I was a two pack a day smoker when I quit.
The thing most people never tell you about smoking is that there are two parts to the addiction. The physical addiction to nicotine is easy to beat. Don't smoke for about 48 hours and it's pretty much gone. The hard part is the mental addiction. You get addicted to the routine of the that first cigarette right after you wake up, the one after you eat, the one you smoke when you're stressed, etc. The way to beat it is with mental warfare.
There are things people will tell you that you probably have rejected because of the cruelty behind the words. Accept all of this and believe it's true because this is your weapon for winning.
1. You stink. The odor coming off  your body is offensive at best. Even if you only smoke outside the tar from the cigarettes is coating your body and you smell bad. Non-smokers don't even want to be in an elevator with you because of how bad you smell. The tar is coating your clothes, your skin, and your hair and you transfer it to everything you come in contact with. You're gross.
2. You're weak. You let cigarettes dictate what you do and when you do it. You can't just go anywhere on the spur of the moment. You have to have a cigarette first. There are places you'll avoid going because you can't smoke easily. You let cigarettes tell you how to live your life.
3. You're inconsiderate. You hold up everyone while they wait for you to smoke your cigarette. You expose family to the smoke and tar, making them smell your stink and poison.
4. Cigarettes are dirty. If you smoke in your car look at all of the ash and sticky tar that's collecting all over your car. Wipe down the windshield and look at all that brown nasty tar. Look around your house at the brown stains on your walls, ceilings, and curtains. Now think about all of this brown, nasty, sticky tar being on your clothes, your skin, your hair, and in your lungs. Every breath your exhale contains some of that brown stickiness too. It is so absolutely gross. You are disgustingly gross, filthy, and dirty.
The only way you are going to get clean is to put down the cigarettes and never pick them up again. You need to hate them and hate the control they have over you. Throw them away and take control over you life.
If you need stories about people who have died from lung cancer I have those too. Two of my families member died in the past year from lung cancer caused by smoking. It's one of the worst ways you can die. Lung cancer is almost always environmental and the number one cause is smoking. As someone who smoked for 18 years and averaged 1-2 packs a day during that 18 year period, I now have to live with the fact that I'm high risk for lung cancer because I was too stupid to quit when I was younger."
"I've only smoked for about 5 years so I think it was easier for me than say a 40 year old. But for me it wasn't as hard as everyone says because I wanted to quit. I mean every smoker thinks they want to quit and they do a little bit, but they would rather keep smoking. I just had a daughter and I knew I had to be a role model. I also couldn't afford them anymore. Another big reason I wanted to quit, I was tired of being a slave to cigarettes. Every hour I needed one, I can't smoke inside anywhere, and people just don't think it's cool anymore. 
As for how I quit, cold turkey. "
"Honestly, I feel I got lucky. I use to be a heavy smoker. I just got tired of the taste after awhile, it didn't really phase me. So I stopped cold turkey."
Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking.
"Combination of exercise & e-cigs.  I signed up for Crossfit to get in shape, and after my first class, I went home, threw my cigarettes away, and haven't had one since.  After that workout I felt like I was going to die from not being able to breathe.  I knew I couldn't work out AND smoke real cigarettes, so it was no longer an option.
That afternoon I bought the cheap NJoy ecigs from 7-11, and those got me through the next couple of weeks. I smoked the ecig much less than the regular cigarettes.  After a couple of weeks, I quit the ecig with no problem.
Before that I had tried EVERYTHING:
* patches (full course of Nicoderm 2x):  I smoked again withing weeks of finishing each course
* Chantix: I didn't have the wacky side effects, but it hurt my stomach horribly
* Wellbutrin:  Made me have suicidal thoughts
* cold turkey: lasted until one of my smoking buddies wanted company or until I got stressed at work
* gum:  too gross to actually chew"
"I've quit smoking 3 times:
1. After smoking for 6 years, I made a new years resolution to quit smoking. At midnight I finished a cigarette and gave the rest of my pack to a friend. I was an asshole for about a week and didn't have a cigarette for 3 years.
2. After thinking ""I can just have an occasional one and be okay"" I started up again. It quickly escalated to a full time habit again. I ended up using nicotine ""mints"" to quit this time.  It took much longer and I was an asshole for closer to a month this time. I was cigarette free for a year.
3. Started up again after during a very dark time in my life which I won't go into here. Four years later, I was on a hike with my 3 year old sun. We were having a great time, and I was struggling getting up a hill.  As he was (literally) running in circles around me I decided that I wanted the be around as long as possible and do as much as I could with him. I mentally prepared myself (read procrastinated) and had my last cigarette about a month after that. This was three years ago and my asshole period was a little over 2 weeks this time.
Things that I've noticed:
* I enjoyed smoking. I still miss it on some level and still have cravings at times. Due to this, I consider myself to be a non-practicing smoker.
* The withdrawal period was harder to get through on each subsequent  attempt.
* I'm not sure if it is because I'm older or not, but it seems that I have lost a measure of my patience each time I've quit.
Quitting is completely a focus of will. It is one of the hardest to get through due to the length of time your will needs to be applied. It will suck.  You will be pissed off.  You will try to rationalize have ""just one to take the edge off"". You will take this stress out on those around you (please warn them, they'll appreciate it). You become your own adversary.
You can get through it. You **will** get through it. No more half-hearted attempts because it is something you should do.  Do it because it is something you want to do.
There are alternatives to lighting up at work.  Step out and take a lap around the parking lot, do some push ups / sit ups, strangle a co-worker (I would avoid that last one). Just try to distract yourself as the craving passes.
Good luck OP. Let us know how it works out."

You could be like my dad and have a heart attack. He has to have triple bypass open heart surgery sometime in the next week or so. Don't smoke and eat your veggies.
"Wife got pregnant and to support her, quit the day we found out. I used patches and that definitely helped ... 5+ years later I could still have a smoke and love it, sometimes it makes my mouth water. I've only had one smoke since and i got super sick from it and keep that in my mind.
Tldr; get a lady friend preggo"
"Cold Turkey ... I've always thought that if you need help to quit smoking (patch, pills, etc...), you aren't REALLY ready to quit ... I realize everyone is different, but this is just my opinion..."
"I moved to Alaska.  If the price doesn't do it, the cold certainly will."
"Smoker for 7 years. My story may differ from others. I have this strange, almost obsession with panicking at the first sign of getting a cold. One day I felt a cold coming on and decided to see how long I could go without having a cigarette since I always felt smoking made me more sick. Before I knew it I hadn't lit up in 24 hours which was the first time since I started smoking since I had done that. So I decided to see if I could do 36 the 48 hours. By the time I reached 60 hours I couldn't believe it. While I still felt like dick and still got sick, I wasn't worried. That is until I had to go back to work. I too know the pressures of being at work and coworkers smoking. (75% of my coworkers smoke.) I kindly told everyone my accomplishments and asked them if they would refrain from invited me out to smoke. 
Well I got shit faced one night at a Halloween party about 3 weeks later, bummed a Newpwort 100 and proceeded to puke all over my pirate wig. I wanted to kill myself for letting myself down. I got so depressed that I would not let myself drink for 2 months for fear of it happening again. 
Moral of the story, for myself at least, going cold turkey is what worked best for me. My obsession with not getting sick always played a pivotal role and embarrassing myself by puking on my costume all played a helping hand in me quitting. I have 15 months clean and couldn't be happier. As others have stated, if you don't want to quit you will never go through with it. "
I was a professional smoker for 15 years. My Dr. at the time gave me a great tip rather than patches or gum do both. Use patches to keep a nice level of nicotine in the blood and then use the gum when you feel you need a tab. I went from 60 a day to zero and its never bothered me since. Took me a few weeks to taper down the gum (which I became addicted too) but got their in the end
Aquire a girlfriend that doesn't like smoking. 
"A real, professional-grade, electronic cigarette. I slowly tapered down the nicotine in the 'juice' until it was gone.
I still get the feeling to smoke occasionally but smelling it once makes that craving go away!
It's unbelievable...but they work!"
"I just started judgmentally thinking about other smokers until I was too embarrassed by my own habit, that I stopped.  I still see myself as a flawed person and allow myself to slip a few times a year and have one.  But at this point, smoking isnt enjoyable. My throat tightens up, and I dont get the momentary rush that I used to.  
Also I would rather have the money I spent on the stupid habit.  that shit adds up so fast.  a pack a day smokers are now throwing away like $4k a year.  I cant imagine that shit.  I am too broke.
Stop being a pussy about it and quit already.  All you smokers are the same.  Filthy and mentally flawed individuals.  Straighten your shit out.  I miss being one of you though, and love you anyways."
"Visual representations can work very well! Say you pay $7 for a pack a day, every day put $7 in a drawer/envelope or whatever, at the end of one week look at the stack of cash! It can be very encouraging. In some cases that could be enough for a gym membership, that new xbox or ps game, or actually being able to pay bills on time!
Im a very visual learning kind of person, this helped me when I quit the first time! Thank you for this thread, im going out to get some patches to quit again."
"I smoked heavily for three years until one day I realized I don't want to die of lung cancer or heart disease, so I stopped smoking.
I'll have a cigarette when I'm really drunk every three or four months, but it's only one and the terrible taste overrides the nicotine buzz."
"Prison. Even though there was an abundance of roll em up tobacco in prison, it was expensive. 1 to 2 dollars per rollie. Also when we could go to our smoking area (the nasty shitty smelling bathrooms, the guards tried to stay far away) there would be a bunch of scavengers.
Scavengers were guys would live in the bathroom and beg to smoke with you and plead for just a hit. Since there were so many people with all kinds of diseases (herpes, hepatitis, hiv) I refused to share my cigarettes with anyone. So I frequently was threatened and called uppity, racist, cheap, asshole...etc
Finally I got caught with a bunch of tobacco and lost 15 days of my earned good time, meaning I'd have to spend an additional two weeks in prison.
So with all that bullshit and stress I gave it up. I tapered off, getting down to just two cigs a day. Then I quit completely, I felt really bad. Didn't get off my bunk for anything for a few days and it took about two weeks for the crappy feelings to go away. The cravings lasted for months, about a year. The craving would be worst when I'd smell tobacco smoke in the air. But I grew to hate the smell years later. And I still do, I can't be around cigarette smoke it bothers me. Ive tried smoking twice since I quit, and both times made me very nauseous and I had to lay down for hours.
P.S. The tobacco was usually smuggled in someone's prison pocket, aka anus.
P.S.S. When I got out of prison the ridiculous price of cigarettes kept me from picking up that habit again. 
"
I quit cold turkey and was convinced that cigarettes were just disgusting.  After that I didn't have the urge.  I know this wouldn't work for 99% of people but it worked for me.
Zyban and the patch.
"I was really hoping I would come here and find some amazing way to quit smoking and all the top comments are talking about quitting cold turkey with sheer will power. God damnit, I don't have that :("
"For me it took a change of setting. I haven't smoked in 5 years now and I can honestly say that cold turkey works. I was living at home with my brother who smoked, and when I moved into the dorm at my university I decided it was a great time to quit because it would be less convenient and those around me didn't smoke. I threw up very meal for the next 4-5 months but it was totally worth it! Hope you can kick it. "
Smoked for 4 years was finally sick of sucking air anytime my buds and I played basketball I went and grabbed a vapor cig got a good amount of nicotine in it haven't had a cig in a year now and feel great
"A combination of LSD and quitting cold turkey.
In the middle of a particularly strong acid trip I was smoking and realized how terrible it tasted, how expensive it was and how bad it smelled.  I put down the cigarette I was smoking, gave the rest of my pack to a friend, and have never ever looked back.  I've never even had a a small urge to smoke again."
I started chewing tobacco... God I fail 
"cold turkey, quit hanging around people that smoke, it helps if your smoking friends quit with you.
I had 2 friends in my regular group of 4 friends that I smoked with, we all quit together, they started up again shortly after. The 1 friend who didn't smoke wanted to help me so he found something we were both interested in and when my other friends went out to smoke, he would talk about that 1 thing with me. It's worked so far and we have a shared interest. He's a really good friend."
"The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. Go check it out, it may change your life."
After 25 years of smoking I simply read a book: Easy Way by Alan Carr. I immediately quit and haven't had so much as a puff since. Been about five years now.
I fell in love with someone who is allergic to smoke. Quit cold turkey and never looked back. Been 6 years almost.
"Chantix.  My wife and I quit at the same time,   she got some pretty nasty side effects, but I didn't get any of them.  
I started taking it on the 1st of July 2011 and had my last cigarette on the 26th of October 2011 when New Zealand won the rugby world cup"
Weed.
"The fact that it became socially unacceptable to smoke.  If I wanted to have friends, I needed to quit.  Then cold turkey."
"Four things:
* Using nicotine gum while smoking my regular amount. Took away the reward, left only the yuck.
* Trying many times. Practice makes perfect.
* The ban on smoking in bars and eateries. Took away the social pressure.
* Burying my mother in law (emphysema), and noticing that the smokers at the funeral looked 20 years older than the non-smokers, despite being the same actual age."
I just quit... tired of spending all that money
"ok rare situation here, but if you can get into it it will work:
started up the W. Ridge of Mt Forbidden as a 1/4-1/2 pack a day smoker.  Partner chained smoked the climb.  He got stoned at the top and began to have a panic-attack about repelling and down-climbing.  This helped to push two other strangers (also on the summit) into panic. 
Three panicked climbers and me began the repels.  My partner continued to chain smoke as I nursemaided three people off the mountain, setting up all the raps and getting them in and out.  By the time we got to the bottom I associated cigarette smoke with fear and stress (it took a couple of hours)-- never smoked again."
Ended up going on a prescription quit-smoking aid called Bupropion (Wellbutrin). Literally made cigarettes taste like garbage. Couldn't smoke again without that awful taste (and bad stomach ache). It basically makes cigarettes extremely aversive. 
"I went cold turkey.  Yes, it sucks, but my reasoning is this...from what I've read, nicotine only stays in your body for 2-3 days.  Once it's flushed, ALL of your cravings are psychological only.  So why keep putting nicotine in your body with the gums or the patches?  Get it out, and let it stay out.  To successfully quit you need to beat the psychological addiction anyway.  Which means you have to really want to quit.
As mealy mouthed as it may sound, the best advice I heard for quitting is the simplest advice: Whenever you want to have a cigarette...don't.  "
"Cold turkey 2/2006 after 30+ years of pack-a-day.  There had been several previous attempts, which had all failed miserably.  This time was relatively easy because I actually *wanted* to stop.  I'd known for years that I *needed* to stop, but the difference between *need* and *want* made it happen.  It's an addiction and the addict has to want to quit.  The craving was minor, surprisingly.  However, the smell of tobacco smoke was like a siren's call to me for right on 6 months.  After that it was repulsive.  Side effect: weight gain."
"I used Chantix. It worked like a charm for me and I didn't see any side effects. Mild nausea if I would take the pill in the morning before eating anything. Other than that, some odd dreams but nothing intense.
Being about my 6th time attempting to quit, for some reason I know this time I'm not going back."
"Both of my parents just found something else to do every time they got the urge to smoke. For my dad, it was diet coke. For my mom, I think she ate a carrot or something like that. I don't really remember, it was so long ago. 
Point is, find *something else* to do instead. My dad put on a bit of weight as a result of using diet coke as a substitute, but it still worked and he's since lost the weight."
"I quit by finally getting down to one per day, at the end of day after work. It helped that I had changed jobs to a workplace that didn't encourage the habit. I also did the patch for when I went out drinking. When I was at the bar and everyone was smoking and my willpower was about to break, I'd apply the patch. I didn't even finish the whole box. That was 10 years ago. I may have a cigarette maybe once a year in a social setting, but I find that I can walk away after the one. "
"An electronic cigarette actually. I never got quite hooked on my E-cig like others do, but it was enough to keep me from wanting cigarettes. A few times I had smoked a cigarette in the middle of my E-cig usage and it tasted for awful and the smoke was too harsh. Naturally I just kind of forgot about my e-cig and now I am completely smoke free."
"I used e-cig after a couple months with that it was easy to stop compared to a cigarette. 6 years of smoking now 6 months smoke free. I do however miss it, I loved smoking I just hated the way it made me feel afterward."
"I know it'll be hard, but you can't go outside with those smokers anymore. I started taking my breaks downstairs alone. I quit 3 years ago. I used Zyban/Wellbutrin. Within 2 weeks the craving was gone. My social life has changed at work but it's for the best! :) smoke free and loving it!"
"I started smoking at 16, and was eventually smoking a pack and a half a day by the time I was 21. I literally needed a cigarette to catch my breath after coughing fits (I wish I was making that up). So after a few attempts to quit in vein, I picked a day, said I would smoke my last cigarette on that day, and that was that. Didn't even finish my last pack; there's one left in my room in case the world is ending ;)
But anyway, when people ask me how I quit, my go to response is a note taken from Yoda's book: ""Do, or do not. There is no try."""
"My father in law is currently dying of stage 4 lung cancer, that was enough of a wake up call for my wife to quit smoking. Let's hope this time is the one that sticks."
Being poor and doing a few push-ups when I craved a cigarette. 
"Former smoker and drug use here (inc heroin and coke). First, I can confirm that smoking was harder for me to quit than heroin. Although, the process was a lot less brutal. Second, to quit smoking, get into an enjoyable competitive sport with friends - mine was squash. After one session you will be robbed completely of your masculinity after your friends walk all over you. Third, take a weekend and an extra day or two off work. Make sure you have enough food at home to last you and simply lock yourself in without smokes. After the 3 or 4 days, the physical addition will be gone. Forth, you'll still get the psychological desire to smoke for quite a while, but just remember - you don't want to look like a pussy at the next squash session.
Regular sport also gives you a lot of positive reinforcement. You'll rapidly notice a vast improvement in your physical abilities - even things like walking up stairs and, more importantly, sex.
Tl;dr Get over the psychological addition of smoking by realising that smoking makes you a pussy."
Just use aversion therapy. Start eating foods that you know will make you diarrhea when you smoke. Start driving terribly and crash when you smoke. Try fucking your life over just because you smoke. GG
"I'm not recommending this, but it worked for me...
bowling alley (when you used to be able to smoke indoors)...
1/2 oz. of shrooms
couple buddies
pitchers of beer
at least 2-3 packs of smokes
consume as much of the above as possible in a reasonable amount of time.
When you are tripping balls and chainsmoking you may look at your cigarette and decide you no longer have any interest.
never smoke again.
true story, worked for me like 12 years ago."
"Having the right mentality and actually truly wanting to quit helped me quit cold turkey. If you don't want to quit for yourself and without outside influence, you're not going to be successful in my opinion. I was tired of all the money I was wasting and how it was really hampering my fitness. "
"Having a baby.  Realizing that my habit would be harmful for the kiddo, and not wanting her to grow up seeing me smoke, have me smell like smoke, etc.  For my wife it was the same thing, she'd tried to quite 2-3 times, but being pregnant was her ""cold turkey"" method."
"The thing that helped me quit was realizing that my addiction would generate emotion to make me want to smoke.
Smoke when you're stressed --> quit smoking --> addiction generates unfounded feelings of stress to make you smoke.
Once I had the conscious realization that my body was generating this feeling in order to make me do something, I found it far easier to overcome."
"It was e-cigs for me. Sure I'm still smoking those, but my quality of life and ability to breathe has improved dramatically. It took a year for me to make a full switch. It was slow, gradual, it helps that I live in a place where it's cold and sucks to go outside for a smoke at night. After the first 6 months I made an active effort to make habitual/mental connections I had with cigs to e-cigs as well. Smoking while drinking was the big one. I started only smoking e-cigs after taking a drink and just resisted the urge to light one up. Now that I've replaced and combined the same cig habits with ecigs I don't need the traditional kind anymore.   
It's all about those habits, sitting on a bench in a park, going for walks, drinking, with friends outside, after meals, those places you formed smoking habits around, those keep you addicted because of the familiarity. If you can replace those with a new habit (like the gum chewing thing) you can get yourself out much easier. Ecigs are a good way to start that because you still get your nicotine. Once you do that you can decrease the nic content in the vape juice and ween yourself off. It takes a while and you may still be smoking nic free vape, but at least you can satisfy the habit without chemical addiction and eventually stop. It takes a while, but that's what worked for me.  
I know you tried ecigs, but the habitual thing is essential to switching. Just puffing on it inside when you get a craving is not the same as going outside to your smoke spot and vapong up there instead of on your couch. "
E-cigarettes. I'd smoked a PAD for 30 years and thought I'd give them a try.  I kept the cigarettes with me and every time I wanted a smoke I took a puff on the ecig first.  Sometimes I went ahead and smoked a cig but soon realised that the ecigs taste better.  After two weeks I was tobacco free - no will power needed.
"I believe that the e-cig is the best option for you.  Even though you have previously tried an ecig, I highly recommend checking out the ecig sub.  You can educate yourself into nicer and more effective ecigs there.  This would also be ideal for your trigger situation as it is legal to smoke an ecig inside. You might have to spend more money on a higher quality ecig, but in the long run you will save loads of money and live a much healthier life.  If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask here."
"What worked for me was to stay at home for about a month. No partying no nothing. I also drew a patern on my hand with a permanent marker. For every day I wrote a line. So whenever I was tempted for a cigarette, I looked at my hand and saw, how many days I got through without tobacco and how much effort would have gone out the window. And I've been clean now for a little short of four years and I couldn't be happier."
"Fear of cancer.  I smoked (at least) 2 packs a day for years.  Quit cold turkey 28 years ago.  Now I drink too much...  Win some, lose some. :)"
"Cold turkey all the way. I have found that with myself and others that when I try to smoke ecigs or switch to gum or dip that I am holding on too hard to the nicotine. 
Cigs were my tobacco of choice and everything else just made me want them. I've seen people jump on the ecig bandwagon who spend MORE now than they did when they just smoked cigarettes. 
I read something profound on reddit when I picked them back up after 2 months: ""There is no such thing as one last cigarette."" You can't quit yesterday and you won't quit tomorrow. In my experience the change HAS to start today."
"I was a smoker for about 10 years. I tried to quit several times before I finally managed to stick with it. Cold turkey with the help of Tootsie Pops is what finally worked for me. For the first week or two, whenever I would want a cigarette, I would have a Tootsie Pop instead. This helped to satiate the oral fixation aspect of smoking for me.
After the first couple weeks I was down to about two suckers a day, and after about a month I didn't need either. Now I can go out with friends that *do* smoke and not want one myself. "
"I used the willpower method, but my wife successfully quit with chantix. She hasn't smoked for three years. and she LOVES smoking. "
Move to MN in the winter -60 with wind chills really makes you want to quit smoking. 
"I had to use patches. They helped curve the cravings pretty well. Kept them on for about 3 weeks and tried a day without and it went okay. I'm not saying you have to completely alienate your friends that smoke but you've gotta stay strong enough to keep away from where they're going to smoke. Pick up a new hobby to pass the extra time. Learn to draw, study things that interest you, listen music, and as useless as it sounds, keep someone in mind you can talk to. A little positive reinforcement goes a long way"
"I went drinking in the pub with my smoker friends every night for a week and did not smoke.  It was among the most difficult things I've ever done, but effectively I used my initial enthusiasm for the idea of giving up to get me through that first week.  Then, in the later weeks when I felt like a cigarette I would think back on how difficult that first week was and refuse to waste that effort.
Still not smoking.  Nearly 10 years."
"I tried quite a few times and obsessed over how hard it was and then one day - distracted by a new job - I just stopped without trying. It wasn't difficult and I never wanted to go back. 
This may sound easier said than done, but we I think we over think quitting and that makes it into a huge deal which is self-defeating."
"Cold turkey! 
I smoked camel wides and marb reds for about 15 years. I been working as a wildland firefighter for a few years and started chewing when i was not smoking and doing both simultaneously.  
When I did not have money for a pack I would walk around getting butts out of ash trey's and bumming smokes.  I remember toward's the end of my addiction it was raining and all I could find was wet soaked butts.  I had to dry them out by puffing on them with a open flame of my bic lighter...nasty! plus coughing up shit all day everyday, yellow fingers, smelling like ass, constantly thinking about smokes...
I quit cold turkey February 26th 2013 about mid day...In the past I would always lie down to go to bed and think about how bad cigs where and how much I hated them but when I woke up I could not go very long without having one...so quitting mid day was something new.  First few days suck but I spent that time on smoking websites, youtube, smoking cell phone apps, I learned  everything I could about cravings from others whenever I had a craving...learn how nicotine breaks down in your system and why we have cravings...drink lots of water.
Even if you go back to smoking don't let that get you down. pick your self up, dust off and try again.
Every time you try and quit I think it's a small victory. It tells your brain that you can quit and you aren't a slave to nicotine...If you quit smoking but chew nicorete, take pills, or use electronic cigarettes and you still have nicotine in your system, your just fooling yourself and are still addicted to nicotine...I don't think there is a point in doing things half ass...
tl;dr Nicotine is bad and cold turkey is the best way to quit. "
"I'm not a huge fan of cigarettes but iv been dipping for about 5 years now. It's gotten to the point where I almost subconsciously put a pinch in after I eat, when I drive, when I wake up, right before I go to bed, in class. Basically 24/7, and it comes out to about a can a day. My question is, do these tips for cigarettes work for smokeless tobacco, or is there another way?"
"only and best way to stop: Don't hang around with smokers until you haven't smoked in half a year or so and can stay strong when the occasional smoker drops in. I just completely stopped hanging out with smokers, especially when drunk."
Meth. 
"I picked up and ecig 181 days ago and have not smoked since.  I am now down to no nicotine juice for the last 3 weeks, and will most likely stop the ecig in the next couple of weeks."
I quit the day my daughter was born. Maybe you should try that?
"Used to be a heavy smoker, hand-rolling helped me to smoke less overall, then somehow I ended up getting a pouch of menthol flavored ""Drum"" brand tobacco.  Even though I don't typically mind the taste of mint or menthol cigarettes, this particular blend was so foul that even a few drags were enough to disgust me into putting the cigarette out.  After a few days of this reduced smoking pattern I decided to quit and was successful.  I truly believe the weaning process was key to my success.  If you have the willpower to not go out and buy whatever tobacco or cigarettes you prefer, there is a chance it may work for you as well.  Best of luck."
"Got sick for 10 days, then got better for 5 days, smoked those days, got nasty bronchitis that ruined a vacation. Decided right then while pouring snot out and feeling my throat and lungs bleed, that was it."
"I tried cold turkey several times but I never could make it past the 3rd day. However, I learned more about the nature of the habit, and myself each time. 
I enjoyed smoking, but I hated aspects of it, so I started to consciously pay more attention to the things I disliked to condition myself to dislike smoking overall until I couldn't stand it any more. 
My brother tried Chantix, but started up again after a few months, because he didn't change any other aspect of his lifestyle. 
I switched from Camels and Marlboros to full-strength American Spirits on a whim and discovered I could go longer between cigarettes. I then progressively forced myself to switch to lighter cigarettes every few months or so until I was smoking their lightest ones. It took about a week for my nicotine tolerance to normalize and get used to them, so I had to force myself through a week of unsatisfying cigarettes.
When I smoked Marlboro Lights, I could only go about 2 hours without a cigarette before I was absolutely fiending. When I smoked the ultra-light American Spirits (Orange pack at the time) however, I could go 16-18 hours and that allowed me to distinguish *craving* a cigarette from just wanting one.
When I first started smoking, I would look for ways to add another cigarette into my day, so when I resolved to quit, I had to to the opposite and break down the overall habit into small individual habits, eliminating them one by one:
Û¢ I never smoked inside, so that part was easy. 
Û¢ I stopped smoking while driving (that was HARD)
Û¢ I stopped smoking after eating
Û¢ I stopped smoking in the morning
Û¢ I stopped smoking after sex
Û¢ I stopped going to bars as much because I would smoke excessively while drinking
Û¢ I stopped smoking after 10PM.
It took me a few weeks to get accustomed to each of these.
At that point I was down to 2-3 cigarettes per day: One after work, one before bed and sometimes another one in between.
After I was able to stick with this list for a month I tried to quit cold turkey one more time, but whenever my cravings came on I was just too irritable to function. I couldn't get past the third day.
I got a prescription for Chantix and after 2 weeks (October 5th, 2012), I had stopped smoking entirely. I finished out the prescription (a full month) and avoided bars, coffee shops and any other place or person with whom I strongly associated smoking.
About a month in, 2 friends died unexpectedly, within a couple weeks of each other. I accepted that I would have one cigarette for the sake of normalcy, enjoyed it and didn't have another one. 
The hardest thing about quitting was growing the fuck up and actually saying no to the spoiled brat in me that felt entitled to cigarettes.
When you're addicted to something, your life is usually really crappy in some way, because the stress and chaos becomes the justification you use to maintain the habit. Once the habit is gone, you realize that you are the one making your life crappy and there simply is no reason to continue doing that. 
The key was being honest with myself so I could take ownership of my choices. In the past, I would tell myself not to smoke over and over, dreading the fact that I knew I would smoke, and then emotionally beat myself up over it. Eventually I realized that the only reason I had failed is because I wasn't honest with myself about what was really going to happen, so I stopped all that nonsense and started admitted to myself that yes, I was in fact going to do it. At that point I was able to honestly say that if I went to a bar or a coffee shop, I would definitely smoke and so I just stopped going. If I knew I was going to have a cigarette, I didn't set myself up for failure by pretending otherwise. This greatly simplified my life.
Taking ownership of my choices instead of constantly feeling powerless against them was the tipping point that helped me really make the changes I needed.
The physical cravings went away entirely after about 10 days on Chantix. They tell you to keep smoking normally and you'll just stop wanting them. That's exactly what happened.
The sentimental cravings stuck around for several months however, but again, that was just a matter of being an adult, saying no to myself and moving on. It really helped that I absolutely hated the smell of cigarette smoke almost immediately after quitting. I disliked it already but man was it awful afterward. 
It took a couple months to relearn how to deal with life and not be an impatient jerk, but I eventually calmed down and got back to enjoying life again. 
I'm so glad I quit. It was easier than I expected and all of the worries I had were for nothing. It was absolutely worth the effort. 
If you haven't already, I suggest subscribing to /r/stopsmoking, even if you aren't ready to quit just yet. It'll help you prepare and find motivation."
"(My dad, not me) getting and surviving cancer. Gave him a reality check"
"3 things. 
1 - someone very close to me got cancer. Visiting an oncology ward was a big nope. 
2 - reading that 50% of smokers die from smoking related illnesses. 
3 - repeatedly telling myself that I was bigger than my addiction and that I could beat it and become a non smoker. I went cold turkey and it was tough but it was something I really, really wanted to be free of. I've never looked back. "
Ecigs..I smoked for 16 years at a pack per day. To me there is no excuse as to why someone cannot quit with these being available. You can also step down the nicotine level over a period of time until you reach 0mg. It was an very easy transition. 
Stop buying cigarettes.
"14 years ago I was made redundant and it was eat or smoke.  I chose not to starve and here I am still not smoking.
Don't buy them, don't put yourself in harms way by picking up a different rest habit.
Take it a day at a time.
I still have a recurring dream that I am smoking but that's all it is.
However, don't replace cigs with food...I am now trying to give that up.."
I got a girlfriend who absolutely hates smoking. And she would hate kissing me after I'd had a cigarette. Stopped smoking two weeks into the relap
"I got pneumonia and it HURT to smoke. It took me a couple of weeks to fully get over it and by that time, my cravings were gone. Having said that, I don't recommend actually attempting to get sick."
A healthy hatred of the smoking and what comes with it. You have to replace smoking with something that you can also get into the habit of. I have only gone 4-5 months ( honestly can't remember) but I remember working at a bar at the time and having to spend at least a hour outside watching people smoke and hating it. Good luck those of you out there. 
"The mindsets talked about here are key and important. 
An actual trick, the one I used: Do not buy them. Set a hard limit for yourself to never buy them. I found that it is a much easier limit to follow. Saying ""Im quitting smoking"" is slightly nebulous and difficult to do. It is a broad task. The specificity of ""I will not buy cigarettes"" its easier. Also, you aren't addicted to buying them, just smoking them, so making that decision at the store its much easier. 
Every once in a while, i will be drunk, and see someone smoking. I will bum one and love it. I won't buy them, though. And I won't bum a lot, because i hate feeling like a, well, bum. So you go a bit easy on yourself by thinking you can still bum them, but it will be a rare occurrence. 
Tl:dr - Just don't BUY them. 
YMMV, but it really helped me and my wife quit. 3 years and counting, with the occasional bummed one."
"I got really sick. Like too sick to even want to smoke and then I used the nicotine patches. 
I work in a cigar bar so whenever I'm working I'm surrounded by people smoking.
You also have to really want to quit."
"Do some research into the science. Not only will it give you methods that work, but it's kind of like when you buy running clothes and sneakers to motivate you to start running: you'll have already incorporated quitting into your life."

"For me it wasn't planned. Woke up in the morning, decided on the spot that I didn't want to smoke anymore and that was it. QuitNow app helped to see my progress and take courage the first weeks but after a while I decided it was consuming my precious SD card space and deleted it."
"The patches helped me and my girlfriend. And determination. 
"
A smokers a smoker when the chips are down. 
"Too bad I'm a bit late to this party, but the BEST thing to do when trying to quit is move. 
Get to another city, or somewhere else, and start a routine without smoking. "
"Very Cold Turkey
If you can get past the first three days with out a cig. The cravings gradually diminish."
E-cig got me off of cigarettes. And a ton of will power. Once I got off nicotine I wanted it so bad but if you just remeber how gross you feel the urge to stay off it over powers the urge to use it
"I am a 22 year old male from Sweden and i used to ""Snus""(Highly addictive) since i was 13 years old until 21. I took a look at my teeth one day and said holy shit what am i doing, and i threw it all away and just stopped. I took on average 24 snus per day. Easiest method is just quitting without those stupid scams like patches, gums etc."
"After smoking for 11 years and trying to quit several times using patches, gum, welbutrin, and other cessation methods; the biggest key to me quitting was the mental decision to not be a smoker anymore.  I couldn't cheat my way there, I had to actually commit to the idea that I was not going to smoke anymore, and I used nicotine lozenges very occasionally to help with the worst cravings which stopped after a week.
Not everyone's best method, but it worked for me."
"A hot girl that I thought I had a chance with + Chantix + a cubic fuckton of will power.
When my quit day came, I had been taking Chantix for a week.  I still wasn't ready to quit and didn't want to, but I did.  I told myself if I made it a day without smoking, I could reward myself with a smoke.  It sucked but I made it through that day and did NOT reward myself with a cigarette.  Then I told myself, if I can make it two days, I'll reward myself with a cigarette.  Two days came and went and I told myself, make it a week and then you can have a cigarette.  
This is when I realized that I was quitting.  *When you quit, you can't reward yourself with that which you are giving up.*  That's completely counterproductive.  This is why I am against nicotine replacement such as lozenges, strips, gum, etc.  You're trading the delivery method of your addiction (cigarettes) to a delivery method sold by a pharmaceutical conglomerate.  But you're still pumping your body full of that same addictive substance.  Like George Carlin said, ""it's not what drugs you're on, but who's.""
In the end, when I quit smoking, I quit completely.  And that is about as cold turkey as it can get, even with the help of Chantix.  It's been over 4 years now and I have not had a single molecule of nicotine in my body since I quit.
I miss it.  I always will.  I still think about it sometimes.  I love the smell of smoke and often will hang out outside with the smokers just to get a whiff of the smoke.  And while I miss smoking and always will, I don't regret quitting either."
"It's not really a trick but I'll tell you what went through my head when I finally quit after many failed attempts. I truly believe it is an essential thought process if you ever want to fully quit and have it last. It's been about a year and a half since I quit and I think I'm finally done with them for good, I can't see any reason I would go back now. I smoked for about 5 years and was able to quit completely cold turkey the moment I made the decision
All that I had to change was my mindset. All the other times, I still thought of myself as a smoker trying to quit. Every time I would have a break at work, was driving home, or after a meal, I would subconsciously consider myself as a smoker trying to quit. When I was a smoker, I really wanted a cigarette and it was excusable to want one because I was still a smoker, I was just trying to quit. Didn't go for a couple days without one? Well I might as well just have one, because I'm a smoker and I need one, even thgh I'm trying to stop.
Then, when I finally quit all I did was tell myself, I no longer smoke. I just do not do it anymore, I'm not a smoker from this point on. Every time someone would offer me one (which was a lot, because it was common for me and my friends to bum them off each other) I would just say ""no, I don't smoke"". Say it just like that, no additional ""trying to quit"" or ""oh no, don't tempt me"" or anything like that. Just repeat the same line, you may even want to tell it to yourself out loud when you get a craving ""no thank you, I don't smoke"". For some reason it became sooo much easier to say no to myself because I beat it into my own brain that I was not a smoker. I would even go outside with my friends while they had a cigarette and it nearly felt like I was going through with the whole ""ritual"" of going out for a cig to relax. 
I believe that is the reason why top comment says studies show that cold turkey is he best way, because if you smoke some it keeps you in the smoker mindset even though you are cutting down. You will still feel like you have the need and that it's excusable to slip up because you are still a smoker and quitting is hard. Be accountable for your own mindset and don't excuse those pervasive thoughts of cigarettes and when you do get one of those cravings, shame yourself for it rather than feel like it's constantly nagging at you.  Every time you get a craving, just tell your own mind to shut the fuck up and deal with it, because your body is no longer a smoker."
"Chantix. 25 yr. habit. Quit jn less than a month. Have NEVER had another craving.
Honestly, if I could have done cold turkey I would have. That addiction had me wrapped up. 
The most important aspect of it for me was that I desperately wanted to quit. Chantix got me there. Gotta talk to your doctor though. That shit really can make people crazy if it's not prescribed. Even then, you need to be aware of your body and stop if you start feeling the crazies.  "
"I've quit a few times. I've slipped a few times. I've been without for over 18 months now. I know I'm better off for it, but there is always that part of my brain that tells me I like it. That I miss it. The tricks the brain play on you are very real. I tend to agree that successful quitting is an act of pure willpower. Your head will be messing with you so hard and only willpower is going to keep you to task.
The use of patches did help but they are not a magic bullet. I've used them each quit attempt, and they were best for breaking the social habits or other smoking triggers. The drive to and from work, after a meal, etc, whatever they happen to be are easier to brush off without the physical craving. 
You still have to quit the patches. When it comes time to reduce the dose and switch to the next step you gotta do it and that is also hard. 
I don't believe that I'll ever stop thinking that it would be nice to have a smoke every now and then. The most certain thing I can say about quitting is that those urges get easier to manage each day after the quit date. "
"I quit ""cold turkey"".
But the biggest thing was:  I wanted to change my lifestyle - completely.  I had just gotten married, and we just got pregnant with our son.  
Back at this time, it was still legal to smoke in bars and restaurants.  
One of my biggest triggers was social smoking, at bars.
Marriage was such a huge 180 for me. It's not that I stopped going to bars, but I went from like 3 nights a week to once or twice a month.
Since that time, after about 2 years of no cigarettes at all, I had trouble every time I either went to a bar, or walked through a foyer where people were smoking.  Cravings.  I would occasionally smoke one or two.  I was so happy when I moved to a state where smoking was banned in restaurants and bars.  Made it so much easier.
Another thing is Wellbutrin. That's supposed to help."
"Commitment just that, really, it works for me."
"I smoked 1.5 packs a day for 15 years. In 2009, my mom worked for a company called Pfizer, most well known for its little blue pill for men. They also develop many other drugs and this little gem called Chantix was just released by them. I had also decided and committed to quitting first before anything because I knew that was the real key to success. 
There are 2 dates you need to set when going this route: date 1 is the day you begin taking it. Date 2 is your quit day. You're supposed to take the chantix every day for a week then quit and then keep taking the chantix for another 3 weeks. It does some hocus pocus like blocking the brains nicotine receptors and what happens is after that first week, your brain feels as if you've never had nicotine in the first place and you can just put the cigarettes down and that's it. 
I set date one so that date 2 coincided with the anniversary of my dads passing away from cancer as kind of a motivation to stick with it. Date one rolls around and I begin taking the chantix. Now, if you've seen the commercials for it, they give you a laundry list of side effects, such as nausea and crazy dreams. They weren't kidding! I could only handle it for the week leading up to my quit date and I stopped taking it the day I quit smoking. It was the 8 year anniversary of my dads passing at that time. Ever since then my brain has subconsciously associated smoking with being sick to my stomach and refuses to let my smoke.  It will be 5 years this August that i quit. The exception is I have a cheap cigar once or twice a month if I go to a casino or something because I enjoy that. 
I can't believe its almost been 5 years already!
TL;DR: chantix works "
"For me it was will power. I really wanted to quit so I did. I quit cold turkey when I was ready and its been almost 5 and a half years now smoke free. After 15 years of smoking it feels amazing to be free of the cigarette. Nothing is going to help you quit if you don't want to, if you really want to quit you can do it without any help from other nicotine products."
"I went cold turkey. Locked myself in my apartment for 3 full days with nothing but Netflix, Chinese delivery and pepto bismol. Worst 72 hours of my life, but I haven't so much as touched a cig in 2 years "
"I quit cold turkey. The trick was that I also stopped drinking for a year as well. I could control myself during the week, but when it was drinkin' time, I couldn't help myself.
"
"Bronchitis. I didn't smoke for very long, about 5 years, but I was smoking about two packs a day and then I got bronchitis. Couldn't smoke for two weeks straight and at that point I was like, ""well, I guess I'll quit."" The cravings never really leave though, they just get less frequent and easier to deal with."
"Ecigs were what worked for me. I smoked for 26 years heavily, and nothing worked for me to quit. But as I got older, I really started to notice that my health was suffering, I would get out of breath, cough constantly and have a tightness in my chest that never went away. 
I found an ecig shop close to where I live one day and went in and had a chat. They gave me different juices to try and when I found one that tasted good to me and gave me the throat hit I was looking for I knew I was done smoking. It will be a year on valentines day since I smoked any tobacco, and I have come down to a very low nicotine juice.
Ecigs are awesome but they take a bit of work finding one that works for you. The cig lookalikes aren't worth the bother though. Get a tank and battery combo!"
"Buy a pack of smokes. Put no limit on how many you can smoke in a day. See how long you can go between smokes. The gaps will get shorter until you just stop. I used to want a smoke because I knew I couldn't have one. But if I didn't restrict myself it was fine, I didn't sweat about it. "
"Do you drink alcohol?  That will be your biggest hurdle, It is almost impossible to quit when you drink regularly.
 Smoke pipe tobacco, its delicious, cheap, smells great, SATISFYING, and lastly one of the 'easier' ways to ween yourself off.... Took me 2 months."
"If you want to stay quit, find a reason not to start back up. For me, I started working out and became a healthier person. I feel great and don't want to smoke because I don't want to give up feeling great. I've quit many times but I never stuck with it until I became a non-smoker instead of just being a smoker who quit smoking."
My father dying of a heart attack.  I quit cold turkey.
"Cold turkey after deciding to quit for myself, of my own volition. Smoked filterless Lucky Strike cigarettes for nine years, quit May of last year.
I stocked up on jerky and chewy candies to occupy that hand-mouth behavior until I got over the two week bridge."
"Cold turkey for sure.  Coupled with being ready to quit AND truly wanting to quit.  I also use those fancy, expensive ""chewing sticks"" (toothpicks) that are made from birch wood and soaked in tea tree oil.  They are really hard and they almost get spicy as you chew on them."
"I quit cold turkey, but whenever I tried quitting suddenly, I could not handle it so I relapsed quickly. It only worked when I started quitting gradually, first conditioning myself to realize that I'm not even enjoying the smokes but am rather doing it out of habit, then by slowly changing this habit by cutting out one ritual cigarette after another (e.g. smoking on the way to the car, on the way home from work, on lunch break, etc). Several days would pass before I would cut out another habitual cigarette. I toughed out each of these habit cuts by thinking about how pleasant the next ritual cigarette would feel. One Monday, after I whittled my habit to half a cigarette a day (I was smoking half-cigarettes for over a month at this point), I decided to go ahead and quit and see how long I'd last. My previous high scores, when I'd quit suddenly, would last a few days at best. This one has been running since last March. I still keep my last half a pack of Marlboro menthols in my drawer, along with a lighter, for easy access, just to rub it in my habit's face that there it is, I can smoke a boag any time I want, but I won't not because I choose not to.
I believe that, for most guilty pleasures, you're ready to start quitting on your own only when the ""guilty"" part eclipses the ""pleasure"" part. When I was quitting smoking, the first couple puffs made me go ""aaaaahh finally, the smokey goodness of relaxation"". Subsequent puffs made me think ""why am I doing this? I'm not even enjoying it. And I'm gonna feel crappier when I finish it, anyway. It's a stupid cancer stick."" At that point it pretty much ceased to be a pleasurable activity altogether."
"My ex-girlfriend, and my mom, both smokers for over 15 years, quit with the help of e-cigarettes."
"30 year smoker.  Failed to quit 100 times.  took chantix for a month without even trying to cut down or quit, then one afternoon 5 weeks in I realized that I had forgotton to have a cigarette for a couple of days.  I got one out, smoked it about half way, and just didn't like it.  I threw it out the window and never had another cigarette again.  Go Chantix.  It blocked all the pleasure receptors in my brain and allowed me to get over the physical addiction to nicotine _while_ smoking!  What I learned is that it was only the physical addiction to the nicotine that was keeping me smoking.  Once that was done, I didn't care for them anymore.  
it was a physical addiction.  It wasn't about willpower or strength of character.  It was just a physical addiction.  A medical condition that was cured with medicine. "
"By absolutely making my mind up that I was going to kick the habit and not allowing failure. I also took it 1 day at a time. Nothing fancy... 
I had smoked 2 packs a day or Marlboro reds for @ 16 years when I quit. "
"I quit for ten years and never stopped wanting one, so accept that you will always want to smoke, and will have to say no for the rest of your life."
"I first quit to ""get in shape"" and be healthy but that didn't last long. Then began dating a beautiful woman (over two years now!) that said how incredibly disgusting it was and she would never date a smoker."
"I quit cold turkey, when I got pregnant, 20 or so years ago.
My husband quit a few years later using the patch and mints. He needed something to substitute for the oral habit, so he bought one of every kind of mints at the store to try. He settled on Altoids, and for about a month, we spent as much on altoids as he was spending on smoking. Then he tapered off the mints over the next month or two after that.
Be warned, one of the side effects is ""vivid dreams"". If you have a partner you sleep with, you wearing the patch at night may affect them too. He decided not to wear it at night as a result of the vivid dreams he was having. I was fine with my vivid dreams sleeping next to him though. "
"I tried twice when using patches, and gum. Failed quickly.
The third time, I went up to our family ranch - notably away from booze - for a couple months to work. Kept myself busy and didnt really have any trouble dropping the habit.
This is after a pack a day for a decade, if that makes any difference."
Wanting to. I chose a method that i think is super effective but wanting to quit is the most important thing. PM me if you think you need a specific method.
"Quitting is easy. I did it loads of times. :-) 
On a serious note though it all comes down to motivation. My then girlfriend said she wouldn't move in to a flat with a smoker. So I had a choice. Spending money giving myself lung cancer or sharing a flat (and by extension a bed) with my girlfriend. Choices like that are actually pretty easy. I just went cold turkey. No patches or e-cigs etc. 
She's my wife now. It was definitely worth it.  "
"I stopped smoking when I started dating my now fiancÌ©. He didn't mind that I smoked but I was very self conscious about how I smelled. So, every single time I saw him I would go home after work, smoke 5 cigarettes, take a shower and head the other direction to see him. It wasn't hard not smoking when we were together even though we would drink a lot and that the best time to smoke! I finally got sick of all the hassle and just stopped. I stopped after 15 years and it's been 5 years since. What also made me stop was when I thought... I'm not in high school anymore and I look pretty stupid smoking because I supposedly 'need' to. "
"I had a kid and that was the inspiration to quit cold turkey.  it's been about 1.5 years and  I don't get cravings much at all any more, maybe once in a blue moon.  Good luck and hang in there OP."
"Just quit. One thing that really helped for me was buying a stack of (non-nicotine) gums. Everytime I would crave, i would just take a fresh gum and try to think of other things.
Also weed."
"Cold turkey, after a bout w/a flu so intense I couldn't smoke anyway. It was my third attempt and have been a non-smoker for 14 years now.
The ultimate trick? Really, it' simple, in principal anyway:during periods of intense craving (the frequency of which gradually diminished over time thankfully) I would tell myself that later on I could smoke AS MUCH AS I WANT! - but just - NOT RIGHT NOW! No matter how bad it got I knew I'd let myself have one, or 20, and believe it or not the thought of all those fresh cigs lined up awaiting got me through those intense but temporary urges, which lasted the better part of a year (about nine months actually). It was probably 7 years before they stopped altogether, or truth be told, still happened but were so brief in duration I would find myself asking, ""Did I just crave a cig?""
So I conned myself basically, but was able to go along with the ruse because the overwhelming urge to smoke would always diminish soon enough for basic will power to take over, although for months it was always very touch and go.
"
"I'd been smoking a pack and a half a day for about 18 years when I quit after using Chantix, only used it for about 6 weeks though. Have been smoke free for about 4years now."
"The way that worked for me was to go for a run. Seriously though, go outside run a 5K for a benchmark time. Then try to quit and compete with that time. It does help if you have a competitive spirit. One year later I have trimmed my time down from 34 minutes to 24 minutes, with hopes to get it down 5 more minutes. Not to mention you'll heal your lungs faster, you'll get in better cardiovascular shape, and you'll just all around feel better about yourself."
What worked for me is this ( Im a 22 year old guy )  Every time I want a cigarette I picture myself dying of cancer in a hospital bed at the age of 25 all by myself.  Then I dont want a cigarette anymore.  Give it a shot I guess
"Anxiety. I was constantly have anxiety and panic attacks. I didn't understand why. So I quit smoking everything, cigarettes and weed, and cut the majority of caffeine out of my life other than my morning cup of coffee. Still have anxiety attacks, but they're much more manageable. It's been almost three years, and I quit cold turkey. I was a smoker for about four years. "
"First of all, you have to want to quit. Not your SO,kids, parents or anybody, you. Then get it in your head about what life will be like without smoking. YOu have to prepare your mind for the lack of your best friend, cigarettes. But then I used Zyban and weed to et oveer the smoking crave."
Working with kids. First day I started a third grade boy asked why I smelled like his uncle. I stopped that day and haven't looked back.
"Bike commuting did it for me. I smoked irregularly but, consistently for 17 years. And this is the only thing that worked. "
"Started dating a girl who didn't smoke.  She HATED when I would light up and wouldn't kiss me etc. (because of the smell).  Just little things like that.  Last straw was one time at a friends - we were all hanging out and drinking (I had started only smoking while drinking).  I light a cigarette and she grabs one too and lights up.  She said 'If you are going to, then I am too.""  5 years later we are married and I am smoke free."
"My great uncle was a heavy smoker. One day the government raised taxes on cigarettes. He was very conservative and strongly opposed to the tax increase. So he vowed to never buy another cigarette again. As a result he quit cold turkey on a day's notice.
So I guess the answer is willpower. External motivation helps too, whether it's political or a friend/SO."
"8 years, cold turkey, 2 months down. As everyone has already said, you really just need a good reason to quit. "
"I put the money I would've spent on cigarettes into building my record collection. If I cut back 2 packs over the course of a week, I could go to the record store and buy a record that weekend.
Seeing what the money I was spending on cigarettes gradually build something I enjoyed was my motivation to cut back more and more until I was completely done."
"You really have to want to quit in order for any method to work. Otherwise you'll keep smoking. I was smoking about 3 packs a day when i just decided I'd had it with smoking. So I went to my doctor and asked to be put on smoking cessation drugs. She basically told me she was only prescribing me a 2-3 week supply of Zyban with no refill and said that if I was going to quit I would do so within that amount of time. I actually stopped smoking before the pills ran out. That was eleven years ago. I have never wanted another cigarette since, but I occasionally have dreams where I am smoking again."
"In short, I had a daughter. I had tried to quit smoking a few times before that, made it 6 months at one time before my dumb ass decided to have just one and oops. Then, my GF(now ex sadly) got pregnant. I spent 9 months in terror of being a dad til one day pop, there she is. I held her for the first time, and I decided it was time to grow up and be an adult. I quit smoking cold turkey, but I also stopped doing a lot of drugs and drinking. I was a pretty bad alcoholic, so that month sucked. But every time I looked down at my little girl, I knew I had to nut up and stay the course. I know this may not help you quit, but sometimes you just need a trigger to keep you quit. Good luck"
"To be honest, dating someone who doesn't smoke works pretty well. "
"I quit about 7 months ago, and stopped taking gum and using the patch 5 months ago. I haven't had a drag since the day that I quit, which was the day I found out that I was going to be a father. 
You see, my father smoked and had to use oxygen for the last few years of his life; he eventually died because of the consequences of his life decisions (liver cancer from alcohol-related Hepatitis C, emphysema, etc.). It was a 10+ year period of hospital visits and bed confinement, and was a long, brutal way to die at the age of 55. When my wife told me that she was pregnant, I realized that I was putting myself at risk of  a similar fate - as well as my children. 
I gathered my smoking cessation devices: the previously mentioned patches and boxes of nicotine gum, as well as several electronic cigarettes. While the E cigs were helpful at first, I was still using them at the same times that I had smoked, such as after meals, whenever I felt nervous, etc. I knew that unless I stopped continuously conditioning my brain to need nicotine at any moment's notice, I would never truly be free of smoking. So I put down the E cigs and focused on being more healthy and using meditation and deep breathing techniques to calm myself during tense situations. 
I am now healthier and feel better than I have in years, and surprisingly I rarely crave a cigarette (even when I'm around them). And with a baby coming any day know (due date is tomorrow), I feel pretty good knowing that I haven't exposed my wife to any 2nd or 3rd degree smoke and that if I keep up this healthy lifestyle, my children (hopefully) should never have to see me have a two hour coughing fit, need to replace my oxygen tank, and/or die a slow and painful death at the age of 55. 
TLDR: Don't want to die in my 50's, but more importantly don't want my children to see me die. And feeling good = good. 
 "
"I think the thought of allowing myself to be controlled by an inanimate object initially compelled me to quit over 3 years ago.  Ecigs, nicorrete, and lozenges helped the first 6 months.
I smoked one cigarette a couple weeks ago which threw off my equilibrium(I literally fell over), made me dizzy, and dry heaved in my toilet.
I will never smoke again."
"Water!
I know this is going to sound funny, but I quite smoking due to water. I quite cold turkey. I got really sick and for the first time in my life I had to struggle to breath. Once I got better I made the decision to quite.
I walked around with these huge bottles of water. I had read somewhere that smoking dehydrates you and that chugging water could help pass intense cravings. So whenever I had a craving to smoke I would start chugging water.
Lets be honest, for the first three days I was pissing like every 15min. It was hell, but it actually worked. Something about taking my mind off wanting a cigarette plus the cold water helped the cravings pass. I did this for about three days like a nut case. After about a week or two I didn't need a lot of water, but still had a bottle of water handy. I can honestly say after about a week or two the cravings completely vanished.
However, did that mean I didn't want to have a smoke when I was out drinking or in the night when I woke up? No, years after I stopped smoking I would wake up and reach for my pack only to remember I no longer smoked. The craving and addition is really easy to kick, changing who you are is not so easy. It took about 1-2 years before the ritual of smoking completely left my system.
It has been nine years since my last smoke. I can say that even being around smokers I have  absolutely no temptation to have a smoke and have never felt better."
"I grew to hate it over time so I just stopped. I made the decision that smoking wasn't going to be part of my life anymore.
Alan Carr's The Easy Way to Quit Smoking helped a bit. I read maybe 1/4 of it after I had already quit and that helped with the cravings. Then I started going for the high score in days without smoking (a smoking cessation app on the phone with a counter). Then after a while, you just forget to check."
"You can do what I did. Smoke a ton of ciggarettes one evening, stress yourself out pretty bad, then dial 911 because you think you might be having a heart attack. That set me straight and I bet it would work for you too."
"I actually had an app that helped me the most. It was called... iQuit? On Apple. 
Our was a timer basically. You set it up saying how many cigarettes you smoke per day, and how many hours between your first and last cig of the day (like 16 hours or whatever).
It spaces your smokes out over that time, so every time you want a cig, look at the app. If it's green, go ahead and smoke. If it's red, the timer will show you how much longer you have to wait. Each time you have a smoke, the intervals between them get a little tiny bit longer.
I found that it threw me off of my habit. I would see the timer say there was like 2 minutes left until I could smoke and i'd think ""yeah I can last that long let me go do this one other thing in the meantime."" Eventually I forgot to come back to the app and have my smoke. If I couldn't wait, it had ""cheats"" so you could smoke now but it would still reset the amount of time until your next one.
I tried cold turkey and just couldn't do it. This method took about a year but I found it worked really well. "
"As someone who used to have a serious drug problem(almost 4 years clean), cigarettes are almost as hard to quit. They are on every corner. They are somewhat socially acceptable. You will see people smoking everywhere. You will smell people smoking everywhere. Those urges will NEVER go away just like my drug of choice was/is for me. At least I had to go searching for the drug, hell, I can buy cigarettes EVERYWHERE. The only way to quit anything is to be 100% DONE. Mentally if you arent saying things like,  ""I am done with this shit. Its gross and im sick of the way it makes me feel and the struggles that are associated with it"" you are probably ready. If you are saying things like, ""I should probably quit"" or ""everyone hates that I smoke I should quit"" you probably arent going to be successful. Get your mind ready because your are going to have to be strong no matter what technique you use. I'm almost ready myself..."
"6 month quitter here
I tapered off, down to two cigarettes a day (from about a pack a day) over a period of two weeks, and just... quit
The reality of e-cigs is: they don't really work. They help with the tapering, but as long as the nicotine is in your system, you will still want to smoke. My two relapses came when I thought I could take a casual ecig puff again when I was stressed. Started smoking again a day later.
I have to say those NYC anti-smoking commercials helped. I just didn't want to commit slow suicide anymore. The support of my fiance, of course, helped a ton. But she never nagged about it."
My dad was a pack a day until he had a stroke.  I think that may have helped with the whole cold turkey thing.
"It took a change in my routine and environment. I took a month long winter session course at a different school and lived with my SO. I got out of class one day, realized I hadn't had a cigarette and decided to stop. Spending weeks away from home and my routine made things a lot easier."
"Electronic cigarettes; it was a seamless transition, did not take a ounce of effort from my part. Started using liquids at a 16mg/ml nicotine level and each month I decreased the concentration by 2. Now I am not addicted to nicotine but keep vaping 0mg liquids for the pleasure of it.
For some context, I smoked about 50 cigarettes per day for 7 years."
Chantix.   Worked like magic...4 years smoke free
I stopped feeling depressed with consoling and a change of friends.
"We are all creatures of habit, remember that.  I was very lucky to be starting a new summer camp job after smoking for nearly 7 years.  I told myself that I would not smoke while there and I bought some nicorette gum for tough days.
Obviously you're not starting new job, but look at what your everyday habits are... the things you do without even knowing.  Actively look to change your habits, maybe change up your work space, how you get to work, your schedule, add in working out change it to another time in the day.  Transitions are tough but the more you can deliberately alter your habitual schedule the more chances you have of deliberately making it your own and choosing what things to add (or dismiss)."
"The prospect of meeting and dating girls.  I decided that if I did not want a wife that smoked, that I should no longer smoke.  After 1 month of quitting I met my wife.  Sure I have had 20 or so over the last 3 years, but only when I am away for the weekend or something.  I quit cold turkey and I have no sympathy for weak minded people who say that they cannot quit cold turkey.  I smoked for 4 years before quitting and sure it was hard, but it was not that difficult that anybody could do it if they wanted to.  I think that the real issue is that most people are not willing to change the way they do things.  Do you smoke in the car? stop doing that.  Do you take smoke breaks? stop doing that.  Once you cut down on the time you allow yourself to smoke it becomes easy."
"Like a lot of the top comments are saying, I too quit cold turkey. I realized from past failures that a lot of the addiction I had was mental. What some call an oral fixation. So I bought a bag of hard candy to suck on when cravings got bad. 
Still off the nic sticks to this day. "
"I was a 1 pack-per-day smoker at most, but the way I quit was a combination of things:
1) being broke as the price of cigs kept going up and up forced me to stop buying packs   
2) deciding I didn't really want any of the fine long-term health benefits that come from tobacco was a strong motivator   
3) resorting to scrounging half-smoked cigs out of ashtrays for a while.
Number 3 was admittedly gross and pathetic, but that's the kind of thing addicts do. Risking Bubonic Aidsplagueherpescancer from some random person's cigarette butt didn't seem as bad as turning down some delicious burning tobacco.   Eventually I grossed myself out enough that I quit and haven't smoked in 7 years.
"
"I smoked from the age of 16 to 21. I wanted to start losing weight and feeling better in general. So, i joined a gym. Not being able to run very well pushed me to want to quit the smokes even more. So i started writing on my calendar at work everyday. I would write how many i had that day and cut down gradually. After about 2 weeks i was down to one a day. Kept going to the gym, and this kept my will power strong and motivated me to be healthy. I would write on the tender no smokes today. Some days i would cheat and have a couple drags here and there. I would always mark if i cheated. The days i cheated made me feel bad so the push to quit was even stronger. It has been over a year now without cigarettes, although i will admit i have snuck the ""drunk drag"" when Im shitfaced, which is rare cuz i hardly drink. I also smoke weed, and i mostly vape to prevent lung gunk, but i guarantee that mj has not inhibited my performance at the gym. I've lost 30 lbs and now i feel like a new person. The change is slow but if you keep it constant it will make a big difference. :) good luck dude/dudette

"There were 3 key points that got me to quit permanently.
#1 - You have to seriously WANT to quit. I tried quitting many times before I was really 100% mentally ready. You have to really want it. You can't be like, ""Man I wish I could quit smoking."" or ""I kinda wanna stop."". It didn't work for me until I was like ""Fuck this, I am done, I am killing myself.""
#2 - Cold Turkey. No cheat cigarettes or nicotine replacement. Every time you take nicotine into your body, all you do is extend the withdrawal symptoms. Instead of 3-7 days of agony, it becomes weeks or even months of agony. It gets easier after the initial 3 days, and every day past that is easier than the last.
#3 - Any time you have a craving, do something to get your mind off it. Seriously. Go for a walk, read an article, get a drink of water, Clean something, work out, do ANYTHING at all that isn't smoking until you forget that you wanted a smoke. Most cravings last about 5 minutes, so if you can kill those 5 minutes, you can last until the next craving, at which time you will want to find another thing to do. My house was so clean by the time my cravings were done, it was a nice little bonus.
A side note - A lot of people say that you can go from being addicted 100% to being a ""once in awhile"" smoker. I wouldn't recommend it. Out of every friend I have who quit for over a year who decided one drunken night to have a single smoke, they ALL went back to smoking full time, pack a day habits. In my eyes, it is just not worth it.
This site kinda helped me: www.whyquit.com (Warning - pictures of sick people)
Haven't smoked for 3 years, so it definitely worked for me. Keep in mind, the cravings don't go away. Ever. They just become weaker, shorter and less frequent. Even after 3 years, sometimes I'll get one. They are much different now though. Now its more like a 5 second thing, where randomly every 2 months or so, I'll see a smoke and be like ""Man I could go for a sm....no fuck that"" and the craving is over that fast.
Keep trying, it's not easy. It took me multiple tries before I got it. (not cheating was the biggest key to success for me)

"I once read that if you quit by time your 30, you have a 95% less chance of getting lung cancer. So, I would always say, I'll quit when I turn 30. Next thing I knew, 14 years had passed and I was quickly approaching my 30th. 
So, I quit cold turkey on my 30th and it worked. I think a big reason why it worked was my 30th was a red letter date. If I smoked again, I couldn't ever go back to my 30th and I might have to wait until I was 40 before I went back. 
Being mentally prepared to never smoke again is the key. "
"I have half a pack of ciggies that I can have any time I want. My trick was to have some around, but at home. Every time I had a craving at work I would tell myself I could have one when I got home. Doing this all day, then not having cig at home because my wife would KILL me, worked.
And patches. I haven't smoked in 7 years, but I still have that half pack of cigs. They must be stale as shit by now."
"My girlfriend. We started dating, she didn't like me smoking. I didn't want to fight about it, so I quit cold turkey. 3 months without one now, and I feel great."
Started vaping. Still hooked on nicotine but I can breath :) 
"You should look into ego style batteries and clearomizers, it gives you a better dose of nic as well as a much more satisfying experience "
"This may be crushed under the cynicism of reddit but true love! I met another student who was an absolutely beautiful girl inside and out. We started dating and she knew I was a smoker and she didn't seem to care. Things began to get serious and she said, ""If you want us to be together I only ask you to change one thing please never smoke again."" It was extremely difficult but I have never smoked again. That was more than 10 years ago! We've been married for 7. People say you can't quit for someone else but I'm evidence to the contrary. 
"
"to me was to prove my friends wrong :) . they make fun of me saying ""you will never made it"" and just to prove them wrong i made it and with no looking back. 3 years ago"
"Having REAL reasons. My examples: wanting to more than casually date a girl who didn't like smoking at all, needing to pass a fitness run test for the military, knowing basic training will suck much worse with nicotine withdrawal. Stuff like this trumps any flimsy unspecific reasons."
I helped my aunt quit. Said I would visit her if she stopped. She stopped by reading sone sort of book. And then I had to visit...
"February 2nd will be one year smoke free for me after 8 years of pack a day smoking. I tried a bunch of different methods, cold turkey, gum, patches...the ONLY thing that's worked is e-cigs. I started with the store ones and the v2's but found myself going back to analog cigs every time. Once I found a good setup, for me an Itaste MVP, it has worked wonderfully and at this point Im not even a little tempted when someone Im with lights up.  "
"I took part in 'Dryathalon' for January - cutting out drinking for one month. I tend to smoke when I drink, it seemed to really help. I now drink again but don't feel the compulsion to smoke."
Vaping plain and simple
"Hypnosis.  I'm not a new-agey kind of guy, but I was a pack-a-day smoker for 16 years and really wanted to stop.  Went to a hypnotist once, cost $125, and haven't touched a cigarette in more than 18 months.  Best $125 I ever spent."
"The fear of paying more for life insurance and health insurance premiums.... 
I have aged parents and I wanted to take out a big life insurance policy to take care of them in case something happens to me. But I found that my smoker status greatly inflated my premiums so I decided to quit by going cold turkey. Currently I am smoke free for 4+ months and in another 5/6 months I will be classified as a non-smoker. "
"I've quit twice over the course of my life. Both times the ""Cold Turkey"" method worked. I haven't smoked in over 2 years. I managed to sate my desire to blow smoke by smoking e-cigs with 0 nicotine juice. Until I finally got over that, and put it down for good. I haven't used the e-cig in over a year. My wife quit thanks to her pregnancy; we're both better off, and saving a shitload of money. 
It's all about willpower. If you can push through the actual ""withdrawl"" period, the rest is mind over matter."
"Meditation. Being aware of my urges, feeling them fully and accepting their temporariness. A lot of water and excercise. "
.
"It's easy. Pick a date when you are going to quit. Then, tell everyone you know that you are going to quit on that date, and that it will be easy, and that only losers can't give up cigarettes. Pride will keep you from smoking.
Also, for the first week or two, make sure you are busy doing things that you wouldn't normally smoke while doing. Eg if you smoke while watching TV, give up TV for a week at the same time. A huge part of it is just keeping yourself busy
"
"smoked for 8 years, quit once for 2 months, then end up smoking again. Motive: in my case stupidness. Is really simple to quit smoking. From what i see you smoke one pack a day, just like i used to. It's about 3 and half months since i quit again. If you don't have any dangerous health problems (another reason to quit) then it's a little harder. 
People think about quiting almost as something else should do it for them. It's false. Not the nicotine gum, not the patches not even the electronic cigarette are helping. All you have to do is trust yourself and say this is it. Today i'm going to do this. (also mean it-stop fooling yourself). Kirkirus has a really good point about quiting. 
The easiest way from my perspective is to adapt to a new way of living. Avoid people that are smoking (when they do it, not all the time), avoid places with a lot of smoke. When you fell like the world is ending if you don't smoke in that moment, try to do something else, anything (not smoking :)), eat something ( don't do that everytime you fell the world is ending or you end up a fatty), play something, call someone, go out and buy a toy for your family, anything that gets your mind from smoking. After a while you will start feeling all thoose things again, smell, taste etc. 
Conclusion: if you want it, you can do it! It's all about you!
Fuck smoking!"
I started with snus and it basicly made me quit smoking in 2 days. I was a smoker for 4 years. So try snus
"Almost similar...
In my case, I had to go through a surgery to remove my wisdom teeth, 4 of them at the same day, after that, during the recover the doctor asked me to know smoke for a couple days, after 2 days I was really bad but after 3 or 4 days I got used to not smoke, so I just kept the Doctor's advice one day at a time until the urge to smoke had gone for good."
E cigs. Literally amazing I never thought I could quit and not really want to smoke. I thought it would always be a struggle. Not so
"I quit cold turkey, went through so much gum for the next few weeks. I found that when ever I left the house that was the hardest part it was like what do I do when I'm walking anywhere. After a while I just sort of forgot about it. Can never get rid of those drunk cravings though"
"Cold turkey for me i'm afraid, this could also be seen as just when I REALLY wanted to quit"
"Heavy x-smoker, also tried everything. Cold turkey didn't work. Just got really pissed and started over eating, and then smoked double amount. Medicine that closes receptors worked, champix. Ciggies tasted like shit and didn't do ANYTHING for me anymore. Haven't smoked since then. "
"I quit when I got diagnosed with a disease that is supposed to make my life a little different. So I pulled the ""grieve all at once"" saying and enjoyed a fun week, quitting after twenty years of smoking. I guess you can also call this a cold turkey quit. "
"i'm in the process right now, i haven't smoked in 3 months. i work in retail, and it was a similar deal. i smoked cause i could take 10 minutes every hour if i wanted to. two biggest things that have helped me have been:
1. not drinking coffee anymore, it's tough but fuck does it help. i switched to tea instead, usually non-caffinated so i can use hot drinks as my ""break"" while i make it at work, very relaxing too.
2. tea tree oil toothpicks, for when you're really bugging out, they're great for the oral fixation.
honestly, those two have made this VERY easy for me, but i also did quit cold turkey.
any other questions, let me know. always glad to help."
"Here's my personal truth: I cheated. 
And by that, here's what I mean: I never liked it to begin with. So why start? The military. Practically every training class (nearly two years of  ""A"" school) had a 15 minute break for smokers. Didn't smoke? Fine, sit your ass in that chair and just wait for 15 minutes. Or go piss. I learned to tolerate and even, in some ways, like smoking. I enjoyed how it made me feel. I enjoyed what it did to my nerves. I couldn't stand the taste, the smell, or the fact that it was killing me. I could feel it fucking up my lungs, but still I did it. Off and on for almost ten years from the legal age that I could smoke. 
So what made me finally decide to stop? My kids. As soon as I found out my fiance was pregnant, I vowed to stop completely. I slipped up every now and then, though, usually when I was drinking and needed something to hype up the buzz. 
But the final nail in the coffin (no pun intended) was when my father died. Diagnosed of Stage IV small cell carcinoma in October. Immediately quit smoking and went on chemo. We lost him that December. Since then, I've slipped up once and that was over two years ago. Every time it creeps into my mind or I'm surrounded by people that are smokers (usually when we're at a party, so it's pretty rare), I think of my Dad, I think of my kids and of losing them, and then it's easy to turn it down. Mostly because I never liked it in the first place. 
So I don't have any real or helpful advice on how to quit, sorry. Try Chantix, I heard that stuff works wonders. "
"I quit on my 30th birthday after smoking for 12 years.  I am 36 now and have never had a nicotine craving since my last smoke. I've had the physical cravings of the act itself, but never for the drug. This is how I did it:
First I had already cut way back. I didn't smoke in the house. I didn't smoke in the car. A pack would last me 2-3 days when I started weaning myself off of them. 
My theory was that if I would steadily push back what time I started smoking everyday, and never smoked before the time I started yesterday, eventually I'd run out of day and not smoke anymore. The process took me about a month and a half, which, if I did it again, I would stretch out for an extra couple of week to make it easier, but my goal was to stop by my birthday so I pushed myself. 
Basically, if I had my first cigarette of the day today at 9am, tomorrow I wouldn't start smoking until 9:15. The only rule was I couldn't start earlier than yesterday. Some days I couldn't push the time back at all. I remember when my start time was around lunch time it was harder, so maybe for a week I was starting at noon before I was able to push it to 12:15. But after a few days I'd be used the later start, so I'd be able to go a little longer. 
I chewed on a ton of tootsie pops to get to that first smoke sometimes, but after the first smoke of the day, I'd never limit myself to how much I smoked. As long as I didn't start before the time I started yesterday, I could smoke all I wanted for the rest of the day. Over the month and a half the start time kept getting later and later until the day before my birthday, I went out at 10pm for what was my first cigarette of the day and the last cigarette I've smoked. I went to bed and never had a nicotine craving again. 
Like I said, at the time I felt like I rushed it at times. I think the more you're used to smoking, the longer it will (and should) take. But weaning myself off cigarettes was the easiest way I could imagine doing it, and it worked perfectly for me. 
Good luck!

"Cold turkey, if you can do it. I managed 9 months, then got complaicant and eventually became a smoker again.
I'm on the e-cigs these days, obviously still hooked on nicotine, but feeling a lot better. 
I hope to stop using them at some point, when cigs are a distant enough memory, but they'll do for now.
Fuck gum, patches, sprays, and especially fuck pills. I tried Champix years ago, made me turn into the Hulk, awful temper, not nice at all. Not everybody has a bad reaction to them, but I know enough that have to steer clear of them."
"I gave up using the cold turkey method and it worked for like 3 months. As soon as I started drinking I would crave smokes though, eventually I succumbed one drunken night and I still haven't shook them. 
Whiskey and a cigarette is just too good."
"Biggest thing (I think) is you have to be ready to stop.  When I tried to stop because I didn't think I could afford it or my girlfriend thought it was gross I failed.  When I decided for me that I didn't want to do it anymore it was easier.  
I picked a date (new year's day, so clichÌ©) and started getting ready by altering routines slightly.  Instead of smoking right after dinner I'd do dishes first, things like that. Then when the day came I used a patch.  Not the first step, I started with the second, and only did one box (2 weeks instead of the recommended 8 week program).  I think this helped because a) I knew I was still getting nicotine and that mentally made it easier when I wanted one and b) I knew that technically it can be dangerous to smoke on the patch, so extra deterrent with immediate consequences instead of far-off ones.  If I really wanted one, I would rub that patch and pretend I was massaging nicotine into me (stupid, but it helped).  After the box ran out I hadn't smoked in 2 weeks, so a large part of the habit was gone.  Then the withdrawal was less annoying, and it's short lived.  
Things to keep in mind that can help you stay the course - you'll feel better physically sooner than you think, and in ways you didn't think about.  It's sooo nice.  Cravings only last a couple minutes, so wait it out.  Habits are harder to break than nicotine, so beware of firsts, i.e. first time drinking, first time at your favorite hangout, all that.  Get past it once and you know you can do it again.  I also allowed myself little rewards, using some of the money I saved to have little treats when it was bothering me more.  
Remember, much of it is in your head, and if you want to be done with it it's easier than you thought it would be.  You just have to be ready.  Final thought, guilt is a killer!  If you slip up and sneak one, don't give up!  It's not the end.  People think, oh fuck I had a smoke, I failed.  This is false, just get back on the horse.  You'll get there.  
This was my experience.  YMMV, obviously, but these things helped me and I wish I'd known some of them at the time.  Good luck!"
"I wasnt a smoker but recently I started using ecigs, so it probably helps for quitting too"

Chantix!  It is expensive (luckily my work paid 100%) but totally worth it in the long run.  Miracle drug that works.  I smoked a pack a day for 20 years and was able to quite with minimal withdrawal.  It's beena  year and a half and still not even a craving.  I can even be around friends that still smoke with no desire.  I love it!!!  Best thing I ever did.
Heroin
I smoked about a pack a day for 15 years. I took Chantix for 1 month and I'm happy to say that in April I will be 4 years smoke free!! At least a half a dozen of my friends and people I know have done the same. No real side effects for me except some pretty vivid dreams while on the medication. 
"Cold turkey after my son was born. My SO quit when she got pregnant, before we even knew. I cut back, but was still smoking cigarettes at work and my pipe at home. I'd been smoking for the better part of a decade. I haven't touched tobacco since the day he was born.
You need to be ready, and you need a reason."

"I was smoking about a pack a day for 3 years. Then went cold turkey. If you can pump yourself up to get through 1 week of withdrawals, then you've made it through about 90% of the symptoms.
Honestly it was a lot easier than I thought it would be, but I also moved to a new state. A big part of addiction is the association with things like driving, eating, working. So a change a scenery makes a big difference. I read that a lot of soldiers in the Korean war were addicted to Heroin, but when they came back to the states the addiction went away.
While most people don't have the luxury of moving, it might help to go on a vacation for a few weeks while you try quitting. Or changing one habit at a time, like don't smoke after you eat a meal. Changing your behavior is the hardest part, the actual chemical addiction is much easier to deal with."
Vaping
"I couldn't sleep / let anyone else sleep because of the coughing. Every time i lay down, i would start coughing. I had so much phlegm in my mouth everytime coughed, it was disgusting. I quit because of that, and whadda ya know, the coughing stopped."
"Cold turkey. You really need to want to quit. If you aren't really ready to quit, little will help you. "
"I caught bronchitis and as I was attempting to smoke cigs and getting one hit followed by a coughing fit that went on until the cig went out. Then i composed myself, re lit it and repeated.   My SO at the time wasnt sick and had zero mercy for my self inflicted suffering. So she laughed at me and joked that I wasn't even getting a hit, she was right and that further infuriated me.  So I said,  fuck this fuck you fuck fuckity fuck! And quit right then. 
I quit out of spite and anger.
"
"I smoked two packs in one day on St Patrick's Day and when I woke up, sick as a dog, my body no longer wanted to smoke.
When I got better a week later and went to smoke a cigarette, I no longer liked it, it hurt to smoke and the desire completely went away. 
*I do not recommend my method.*"
"There is probably no way that OP will see this suggestion but, quit cold turkey while on a vacation. That's what did it for me."

"Pfft, I must have made more than fifteen attempts to quit before it finally stuck. 
My advice? Keep at it. Don't get discouraged when you have a moment of weakness, just quit again. Every time I quit I did a little bit better until one magical day when I realized that it had been a few days since I even thought about smoking, and that I was finally going to make it this time."
Vaping is what got me to quit after smoking for 20 years. I started out on a higher nicotine level and bumped myself down. This Sunday will be my 1 year anniversary of quitting.
"Pregnancy, but to be honest with you I was never a huge smoker. Just when I was hanging with friends or drinking. I never really smoked when I was stressed or bored, and I *never* smoked when I was alone. "
"I got crazy drunk on a Saturday night.  Pretty much slept all through Sunday (no cigarettes).  Then, Monday morning, I decided not to buy a pack.  Haven't bought one since.  Cold turkey ftw.
Edit:This was awhile ago"
Welbutrin and a desire to quit. Having a very attractive wife threaten to stop kissing you (among other things) was also a great motivator. 
Left my Ex.  Has been smooth sailing ever since.
"Getting two upper respiratory lung infections in a row was motivation enough. I still had a hard time quitting but I knew I had to. I don't really recommend doing this but it worked for me. I started smoking dokha. Its kind of tobacco pipe that is popular in Dubai. So its rare. When I ran out of the tobacco made for it, I couldn't find any in my home city. I tried to smoke cigs again but they tasted so awful, I couldn't even take a 2nd drag. and the rest is history. I'm not advising you to do this, its just the way I managed to quit. Good Luck! "
"My mother got cancer, it shit me up. "
"A buddy told me to do this and it worked, I hope it helps you:
-I smoked about seven-fold what i would in a normal day, and literally forced myself to oversmoke so much that i got sick with cough fits, phlem, chest pains, and dizziness for about 3 days. I had successfully made myself completely repulsed and sickened by the thought or smell of tobacco and never looked back since. At that point i hated smoking as much as i did and couldn't make myself stop. Good luck to any of you going through the same."
4mg generic Nicorette. 170 pieces - $31.00 at Walmart.com. You get used to it and I have been addicted to them for 5 years now. I pray it doesn't turn out that they give you cancer as well!
"I smoked easily a pack a day for like 6 years and, after ""quitting"" multiple times, the only thing that makes it work is your own desire to quit. Cold turkey is the most effective method, because ""weening"" yourself off of addictive substance abuse is just nonsense. The only way to get your brain to stop craving a chemical is by not giving it that chemical *and then sacking the fuck up when it starts to throw a hissy fit about it*. Trust me, the ""bad part"" is roughly day 2-5 and then the edge starts to die down a bit. If you can make it through a week, the worst is over and within another week you're past craving the chemical part of the addiction.  The last hump to get over is training yourself not to smoke during the physical addiction queues like driving or drinking, for instance.
If you still like to smoke, and want to smoke, that's a mindset you need to change. Quitting is the easiest thing in the world when you can *truthfully* say to yourself ""I no longer wish to smoke anymore because it's an expensive bad habit that is literally killing me in the process. It has absolutely no up-side."""
"pretty much cold turkey, I never weaned myself down. i never said ""i'm quitting"" or told people I was. I just told myself i'm not gonna smoke any ciggarettes today, every day."
"Dude. I just one day stopped being addicted to smoking I don't know why or how, I just stopped. Addiction is for life. Being a smoker is part of who I am. To quit is to give up who you are. Truth is, you'll be unhappy, smoker or not. I like the taste of tobacco and think its a great activity. I binge smoke from time to time but for the most part I quit. Smokers and ex smokers are miserable judgemental people. Don't listen to them, listen to yourself. You're not addicted to the chemical you're addicted to a lifestyle, you're addicted to yourself. So embrace it and love it. "
"In a month I'll have 2 years behind me. It was  the first time in my life that I lived somewhere that no one else smoked and that made a huge difference.  I used the patch for a couple weeks but it ended up making me sick so I quit that too. (I don't know where you live but in Canada we have a smoking cessation program where you can get free gum and patches if you call 911 - the nurse hotline.) The reason I didn't go back to smoking was that my fiancÌ© had quit too and I didn't want to be the one spending our money on something that would kill me. We are low income so it made me feel really guilty even thinking about it. I'm not gunna lie, I think about cigarettes daily. But my son and fiancÌ© keep me on track without even knowing it. 
"
I got pregnant. :/
I was in the hospital for long enough for the effects of addiction to wear off. Kinda lucky cause I could not summon the willpower for cold turkey.
"Cold turkey is the only way.  I quit while my wife continued to smoke.  She didn't even realize for a week until we were almost out and she asked me to get more and I told her that she had to buy her own.  There are a couple things that will help.
1.  Quit on a Tuesday, by the time the weekend gets here the cravings were lessened.
2.  Have a plan.  Everything you are going to do for the next couple weeks, play games, go to movies, keep busy!
3.  Snacks!  Peanuts, cashews, almonds, jerky, carrots, anything that is easy to stick in your mouth.  You can get the weight off later.  Large meals are a trigger.
4.  Drink water and I mean lots of water.  Try and avoid soda and especially alcohol.
Good luck!
"
After reading some posts and looking back at my experience I would have to say that u really have to want to quit. U have to accept that it is going to be hard and not use the excuse of how difficult it is to continue smoking. Quitting fucking sucks. That's the truth. What u r feeling is no different than what anyone else feels and it is no reason for u to light one up. I tried to quit countless times only to fail after each one. But u get to the point where u say to urself that this isn't a game and I have to be serious about this. Get rid of any cigarettes in ur house. Get rid of the smell. Try to separate urself from others who smoke or at least at the actual time that they r smoking. Live ur new smokeless life because that's what u have now. It's like when people say they r on a diet and always fail. It's not a diet it's a new lifestyle that they r now living. That's how u have to look at it
"I smoked until I got really sick. A few times. Eventually, the thought of a sweet Camel Blue (lights at the time) made me sick to my stomach. That's what I recommend for anyone trying to quit."
I have tried everything from being hypnotized to cold turkey gum patches etc. I just got into vaping. Not your typical e-cig from the gas station. Find a shop that sells liquid etc. After one week of smoking a pack a day I stopped. The taste is so good I just lit a CIG and couldn't even smoke it because it was so gross! Do it now!
"Running did it for me.  It was hard to get going, but each run was an investment. Every cigarette was counter productive to my goal and really illustrated how much damage I was inflicting on my self."
"It was very tough for me, the key is to keep trying, I think it took me 6 or 7 tries to finally kick the habbit for good, it also takes time for it to sink in just how damaging smoking is to your health.
I did use nicorette gums, which helped tremendously because it removes your physical craving, but most likely you'll become addicted to the gum instead afterwards, which is still better than smoking I guess, some people just go on the rest of their lives being nicorette addicts instead, again, still beats smoking.
If it's your first couple times trying to quit, you will most likely fail, the key is to not beat yourself up for it, just try again at a later date, you probably have been smoking for a very, very long time, it takes a couple of tries to get it right! I look at it this way, practice makes perfect.
Same thing with relapse, if it happens it happens, don't dwell on it, just pick yourself back up and try again. If you need help from some form of smoking cessation aids, use them. From my personal experience, it's hell of a lot easier to give up nicorette than quitting smoking!
One last thing, even after long periods of not smoking, you might still occasionally get the sudden craving out of nowhere, remind yourself that the craving is ONLY TEMPORARY AND WILL PASS EVENTUALLY, and just distract yourself with some other activities very quickly.
Good luck my friend! A life as a non-smoker is so much better than a smoker! Once you quit, you realize just how much freedom you give up for being a smoker! You no longer have to plan your days around your smoke breaks, you don't have to worry about meetings run long or being stuck on a long flight, you no longer have to ""case the joint"" when you get to a new place to look for the smoking spot, I can go on and on about how nice it is to remove the shackles of nicotine, but these are things you will have to find out for yourself."
The patch and my wife threatening to leave me if I didn't quit.
"Where did the term ""cold turkey"" originate from?"
"Vanity.  I've got a wrinkle on my upper lip from all the puckering up to inhale.  It's been 3 years since I kicked the habit and probably my 4th or 5th attempt.  Just don't quit quitting, you can do it."
"""Cig-a-like"" eCigarettes, the kind you buy at the gas station, are pretty much junk.  I suggest you get into more advanced eCigs mods, preferably regulated mods, rebuildable atomizers and even eventually start to make your own eLiquid.  It's a bit of a learning curve, but once you get into it you'll be kicking yourself for not doing it sooner.

"My boyfriend , my cousin and my brother all quit using vapor cigs. Not ones that look like actual cigarettes,like blu, those my boyfriend tried and it didn't work for him. My brother went to a place called monster vape and had quit. My boyfriend tried it since it worked for my brother, he hadn't smoked for almost a year now. Told my cousin and now she's smoke free. "
"Growing a beard. Smelled like smoke even more. Transitioned slowly to e cigs starting 3-4 years ago. Once the technology caught up, I quit cigs all together. Now I vape 0 nicotine as a hobby. Over one year with no cigs."
"I used e-cigarettes to quit.  Haven't smoked in over a year now and i barely ever touch my e-cig anymore. I also took up running, running helps you stay smoke free about as much as the e-cig helped."
"A coworker of mine had the hardest time quitting smoking...
...until one day, when she got sick and was throwing up.
Every time she would puke, she would take a drag from a cigarette.
After that she completely lost the urge to smoke again.
I don't smoke but I thought it was completely brilliant. 
"
"State of Minnesota increased tobacco tax by nearly $2/pack. Also nicotine patches. Also the terrible family history of heart disease and lung cancer. I'm almost a year into it and rarely even think about smoking anymore. 
Motivation is the only real way to quit smoking IMO. "
"First and foremost you must have the desire to actually quit! You have to have that want factor! Otherwise at the first sight of stress or other triggers youÛªll pick it right back up. 
I found that the patches work great at getting rid of the nicotine cravings, but the daily routines like a smoking after eating, drinking coffee in the morning or driver is what was a little tough to kick. 
I changed my routines a little bit around and have been smoke free for 6 weeks! 
FYI I smoked for 13 years. 
Good luck! It's hard but it can be kicked!
"
"I've been cigarette free for 2 years.  Cold turkey.  The hardest part was driving and being around friends who smoke.  For driving I cut straws to the size of cigs and used them for a while.  The friends thing, well you have to just have will power because your friends are gonna smoke.
"
"When I quit, I wasn't planning on it. A couple friends were quitting and I was asked by them if I wanted in. I said screw it. So we decided to see who could last the longest. Things that helped me. I was already smoking a lot of pot at the time, so when I got a craving, I would smoke a bowl or joint. Oral fixation taken care of. I also played a lot of Battlefield 3 to keep my mind off of it. Also work kept me busy enough. Bam! A distraction. Ok, so the tricky part. How to handle all the times you would normally be smoking. After eating, after smoking a bowl, after a stressful situation, with coffee, etc. I had to consciously tell myself I didn't need a smoke. Also weed helped again. After about a month of being focused, I didn't feel the need to smoke anymore. So I quit smoking weed. I had to do one last test. The last time I had quit, I started back up do to drinking. I bought three talk cans and pounded them. I was lit and I didn't want to smoke. Success! My friends still smoke though. Oh well. Now, this worked for me. Everyone is different. The basic lesson is there. Cover oral fixation. Distract yourself/keep busy. Stay focused. You have to want to quit too. I didn't expect to quit, but I had wanted to quit for a long time. Just need the proper push I guess. Oh, I quit cold turkey. The weening thing doesn't work for me.

"I used the e-cigs only when I was having a nic fit, then it was cold turkey... also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8tR4Epr-KU&feature=youtube_gdata_player"
"I smoked for 17 years and the last ten years were almost two packs of Camel filters per day.  I tried quitting probably 30-40 times utilizing everything out there, patch, gum, pills, plastic whistles and nothing even remotely worked.  The longest I had quit was 3 days.  I have a pretty addictive personality and very little self restraint or willpower.  I give into my urges rather easily so the effort of trying to quit was almost futile. Then I tried a product called Quest cigarettes which was a program where there was 3 types of cigarette levels and each level had a different amount of nicotine.  1 was basically a Marlboro Light, 2 was an Ultralight and 3 had almost no nicotine at all like .005% I believe.  It took awhile to get used to a light coming from Camels but it took about 3 months on step 1 to be able to move to step 2 and that took two months and step 3 was 2 months as well.  The beauty of it was I smoked whenever I wanted and as much as I wanted.  If I had the urge to smoke I did, I didn't beat myself up about it.  My mind slowly leveled out at each level and I can still remember tossing the last cigarette I ever smoked.  As I tossed it on the ground to put it out I remember thinking how I had absolutely no urge to smoke anymore.  Than two weeks later I was sitting in a bar with two people who were smoking and I had no urge at all even after a few drinks.  That was 9 years ago and I have had zero urges since.  Too bad they discontinued Quest in 2010 it was a magical product."
"You wanna quit? Easy. As in ""Alan Carr's the easy way to stop smoking"". I used it, and have stopped smoking now for over 4years. Give it a go, it even comes in audio book. "
"It sounds stupid but I just stopped little by little. I didn't restrict myself from it. I cut back more and more and eventually it started to taste so bad and make me feel so bad I didn't want to do it anymore. If I smoke one now I feel like shit for hours. So just cut back more and more until it grosses
 you out... If you love smoking and it will never be gross to you. I'm not sure I can help then. "

"This is probably going to be buried but here goes. One night I got hammered and cigarettes, when you are are drunk, are like crack for a crackhead. Bought a pack of cigs at a local 7-11 and started chatting n smoking with some buddies outside a bar. Thought I had a pretty good night, didn't remember much (always the sign of a good night, right?). I woke up the next morning, and barely could speak. My throat was basically destroyed. Looked in my pocket and there was an empty pack of cigs. Turns out I smoked the whole pack in about 3 hours. Luckily nothing bad that was long term came out of it but now when I think of the taste of cigs I feel like throwing up. 
TLDR: Buy a pack of cigs and smoke them all in 3 hours. "
"This is not really going to be helpful for anyone, but what worked for me was being in the hospital. I went in for what was supposed to be a minor surgery but I ended up having to stay there for over a month. I was in a lot of pain most of the time and even if anyone had let me do so, I wouldn't have been capable of going outside for a smoke. I was sort of forced to quit, as it was really my only option, and the pain meds I was on got me through any withdrawals, I guess."
"- stop buying cigarettes.
- stop going outside for smoke breaks, even if it means being ""antisocial""
- if you work in a clinic or hospital, keep taking your ""smoke breaks"" but instead go for a walk."
"Electronic cigarettes. Started with the blu's, and then I picked up an ego pen. I smoked on an off for a year, and then I invested in a more expensive, long term electronic cigarette. Since then I haven't smoked more than a drunken cigarette or two, in about a year. I started smoking heavily at 16, and I'm 25 now. "
I had also heard that if you have access to a sauna you should go for two days after you quit to sweat out the nicotine in your system and that it really helps with cravings and overall follow through.
"I started smoking in 1993 and I was a pack and a half a day smoker by the time I quit in 2008. I used all three steps of the Nicoderm CQ patches as directed and that helped with the nicotine cravings. As far as the oral fixation part of smoking...I smoke a ton of pot. As soon as I got out of work I would smoke a joint or bowl and would continue to smoke pot throughout the day. As I moved on to steps 2 and 3 of the Nicoderm patches I also cut down on the weed smoking considerably, to the point where I was only smoking one or two bowls a day during step 3 of the patches. Once I was done with the patches I also stopped smoking weed for a year or so. Fast forward to 2014 and I am still tobacco free, though I still enjoy the occasional toke. 
I know all I did was substitute one vice for another, and this method of quitting smoking cigs won't work for everyone for various reasons. But it worked for me. "
"I quit cold turkey. I think my decision was made, and the opportunity just came with another cold in the middle of winter. 
My decision was made because 
1/ I reflected for some time on why I was smoking (what happened in my mind when I lit a cig) and did not like the weakness and fear I saw there in me,      
2/ babies were born in my family, I felt the love I had for them, and refused to give them a bad example, or leave them early, 
3/ maybe least importantly, I did not feel like giving money to the cigarette makers
PS: surprisingly enough (or not), it's been two summers I have started again smoking for the duration of festivals (5-7 days), enjoyed it thoroughly, and quit with no issue at the gate when leaving."
"After 2 failed legitimate attempts (took Zyban both those times), I took a course called ""X-smokers"". It's basically a behaviour-modification/brainwashing set of in-person sessions. 8 weeks in length, you smoke for the first 5 weeks, then the last 3 weeks are the non-smoking weeks. Worked great and never looked back. They teach you about how your body reacts to cigarettes and and the whole physical side of it. They also teach you about how the nicotine addiction isn't really all that strong, and it's mostly just the psychological addiction.
The keys to the course for me was that they immediately make you change the cigarettes you're used to smoking, then they start breaking what you most closely associate with smoking. First thing they took away was coffee & cigarettes. You could still have your smoke and coffee, but you could no longer have them simultaneously. Then they introduce ""control times"". You want to have a smoke after that nice big meal? Nope, wait 10 minutes, then smoke. You wanna have a smoke with that beer? Nope, wait 10 minutes after you're done that drink, then smoke (this was HUGE - you end up wanting a to have that next drink instead of waiting to have a cigarette). The control times get longer and longer as you go through the course. Then you start to break the ties with all the things you associate with smoking.
Yes, the first couple of days after you stop smoking are difficult, but you are given the techniques to deal with it. Also, from the beginning of the course you are told to keep all your cigarette buts in a see-through glass jar. Pretty gross, but you get to see what you were doing to yourself.
I quit in November of 2006 and haven't looked back. No desire to start again either.
Good luck."
"Wanting to.
And cold turkey.  Quit for a few weeks after finally, FINALLY deciding I wanted/needed to.  Lapsed and tried one, but after the few weeks had passed, it made me feel sick.  So I put it down, and never lit up again.  I don't even get the urges anymore....not even when drinking, which surprises me."
Standing on the porch of my apartment in only shorts when it was below freezing trying to get a quick smoke in. Then I realized how fucking stupid it was and quit cold turkey. 12 years later I still would kill someone for a smoke. I suppose that is why I have a food addiction problem I need to work on as well. Only prob is I can't quit food cold turkey. 
"Quitting for just today. I would tell myself each and every day that I was just quitting for today, and that if I made it through, I could smoke tomorrow. After the first 3-4 days of stringing together this psychological lie, I found myself craving cigarettes less and less, to the point where I didn't want them any more. 
Truth be told, if I'm out drinking and someone offers me a smoke, I may take a couple drags from it, but I haven't had a whole cigarette to myself in more than a year.
That, and smell your fingers after you smoke. It would make me gag everytime. Ew."
Cold turkey. Decided i wanted to stop and just stopped. Havent looked back.
"my wife (28) and I (30) were planning to have kids.  So we quit cold turkey.  It stuck, and we haven't looked back in 13 years.  There are some mitigating factors.
We both smoked less than a pack a day, although if we went out drinking or partying I at least could smoke a pack in an evening.  
We live in Canada and at the time, Marlboro Lights cigarettes were still unavailable for sale legally in Canada.  I bought all of my ML's as contraband usually via a couple of stores in Toronto's Chinatown neighbourhood.  Occasionally the government's antismuggling efforts would be successful and the supply would be limited, and eventually the cigarettes would be the proverbial bottom of the barrel, meaning they would turn stale very quickly after opening a pack.  
I hated the taste of other cigarettes, so switching to another brand wasn't possible for me.  
The end result of the scarcity, staleness and being locked into a single brand meant that I essentially weaned myself off cigarettes because the experience had become so unpleasant to me that I smoked less and less until I just stopped.
In my wife's case, she just stopped and didn't start again.  She told me she never liked smoking much to begin with so she didn't find it difficult.  
Obviously our circumstances won't line up with everyone else's. But in our case the formula was motivation (cleaning up before conceiving a child and being healthier in general), and opportunity for me, via the poisoned well of my cigarette supply.  
I highly recommend the stale cigarette thing btw.  Open all your packs and just let them sit.  Over time they'll be less and less pleasant to smoke.  It could help."
"A. Don't give upÛÓeven after ""cheating""
B. Cold turkey is the only way to goÛÓramping down is still smoking
C. Decide to not be a smokerÛÓyou have to retool yourself to dislike the smell, the feelings of it, etc.
There is no magic bullet. It takes diligence. Trust me, I still crave them no and again (and even cheat), but with the three things above I have quit.
"
"When you feel a craving coming on, tighten your lips together and inhale deeply a few times. Don't take actually take a breath, just let a little air slip in through your closed mouth. This mimics the way inhaling cigarette smoke deprives oxygen to your lungs and tricks the brain into feeling like you took a puff. You may even feel a bit light headed like when you light up after not having a smoke for a long time. This technique was told to me by a doctor years ago and has worked for myself and others I've mentioned it to. "
"You have to have some self control and a will to quit. There's nothing else. I decided one day that I wanted to taste again and not wake up feeling like I had a cold. Haven't had a cigarette in 3 years. 
If you've tried to quit and failed its because you want to fail, nothing more. Good luck on the next attempt. I really want you to quit as well, random stranger."
E-Cigs.....three years with out a real cigarette now
"Cold turkey 8 years ago with my wife. We both quit and went though it together. We leaned on each other during the cravings, and having some one else helped us pull through. "
"I just quit. One night I had my last cigarette from the pack and decided not to buy more the next day. Made it ok the entire day then went and got absolutely hammered. I could smell the smoke coming in from outside and really wanted one. I told myself no and my friends/support system said no. From that day on I knew that if I could be that shitfaced and not need a cigarette, then I wouldn't need it anymore. "
"Common sense
"
I quit during a bad bout of bronchitis.  I simply couldn't smoke while I was sick.  It took me a month to get over it.  By then I was past the physical withdrawal effects.  For a while I'd bum a cigarette every so often while I drank.  Then that tapered off as I pretty much stopped drinking.
It's not easy. I quit smoking by telling myself in my head every time I took a drag of a cigarette that this tastes awful. It might've been two months maybe three but eventually the cigarette actually did start tasting awful and I didn't want to smoke anymore and that's when I knew it was time to quit. And then once I quit I didn't smoke that's the hardest part don't smoke no matter what happened. If your girlfriend breaking up with you don't smoke if you're eating a great steak don't smoke after word. Oh and the cravings will be there you know that it really strong at certain points seven days is a really strong craving 15 days is a really strong craving 30 days is a huge craving and then even at six months any year every now and then I still had really big craving but just don't smoke and don't have them anywhere around you. When I quit I was working in a bar where you could smoke and being offered three packs of cigarettes so one day all the sudden for me to stop quitting is probably the hardest it could've ever been. Good luck and just with every half of that cigarette tell yourself how much you think it tastes terrible or you hate the tape or this tape awful anything to just start convincing yourself that it doesn't taste good.  And maybe start smoking weed
"I'm not a smoker, but my uncle was. He worked as a military engineer, so a lot of travelling in his youth, a lot of stresses, and a lot of work. Naturally, smoke was his close friend.
Not until he fell ill, about 20 years ago. I didn't ask him what did he contracted, but he said during that time feeling ill on bed, the smell and the taste of smoke turned, as he described, disgusting. I guess smoke was too bad for him that he has been a non-smoker ever since."
"I smoked for 12yrs im 2yrs quit right now, my personal opinion has always been cold turkey is the best, and you can only truly quit if YOU want to quit. I failed a few times and I realized I didn't want to quit because I didn't like smoking I wanted to quit because my parents and friends told me it was bad for me so I should want to quit, it fooled me into thinking I wanted to quit, but in reality I never truly wanted to stop, I just wanted everyone to stop hassling me about it and easiest way was to say ""im trying to quit"". Really I would say that and then just look for a time when I could smoke and nobody would see me. It has to be you that wants to truly quit smoking to do it, you have to hate everything about it, the detriment to your health, the cost, the having to go outside on a cold rainy day and you have to decide all the crap is worse than the enjoyment of having a smoke. Once you reach the point where you're getting no enjoyment anymore only gradually more pissed off at everything smoking is taking away from you, thats when its time to start quitting."
"Really it's a state of mind. I had made excuses, e.g. 'after this pack', etc. for years. I had tried to stop several times previously without success. I was off work for 2 weeks sick and just thought 'now's the time'. I didn't go out socially for those 2 weeks. I did use patches but they were uncomfortable and I'm not sure how much they really helped. The main thing was the realisation that smoking had become the master of me and I did not want to be a slave. It got easier after a couple of months but I know that I can NEVER smoke again or I will be back where I started."
"I began by extending the time between buying a new pack and each individual cigarette. Even if at first it was only a few hours between a cigarette that was a small win. Each pack I would push further and further from the last. At the point I could make it 2 or 3 days between is when I started to notice the awful cigarette smell and taste again. Extending the time between packs at the end could be an entire week at a time and that made the smell, taste and choking unbearable. Experiencing that grossness enough times was enough for me to take the final step of just not buying anymore. It took maybe 6-8 months after my last pack for random urges to completely disappear. I tried cold turkey from a pack a day several times but failed every time. "
"Have you tried Vaping?  I switched from traditional cigarettes over 6 months ago and have not looked back since.  You can get a pretty cheap setup for under 100 bucks or even just pickup a disposable e-cigarette like Blu or Njoy.  I realize it's giving up one habbit for another, but I personally feel 1000 times better than when I smoked traditional analog cigarette's.  Good luck to you sir!
Edit: sorry, just read the last bit of your post.  It's not easy to switch to e-cigs, by a long shot, but after 2-3 days the cravings start to go away.  I would recommend getting something with the highest nicotine level you can find.  24mg worked for me.  Now I'm at 12 and lowering it a bit every couple months."
"I quit buying cigarettes. 
For a little while I blagged fags off my mates while I was drinking. Yeah, it was dickish, so I'd only ask for one or two instead of five or ten. 
Eventually that was one. Now I refuse ones that are offered. Social pressure is a useful tool! "
"I smoked for over two years (not long, I know) but my wife had been a smoker for about five or so. One day we were driving back to the house, smoking our cigarettes and I said, ""This is my last cigarette."". She decided that it would be her last cigarette too. That was 4 months ago. We quit 100% cold turkey and I think it's the best way.
One of the biggest helps for us is that we had each other, and we both wanted to quit. Another thing that helped tremendously, and this may sound counter-productive, but we kept our cigarettes around. We knew exactly where they were and could light up at any point if we chose to. I think we both took comfort in that. We never actually smoked them and eventually threw them away.
The first few weeks is the hardest, everything you do you associate with doing it while smoking. On break at work, smoke. Just ate? Smoke.
Just woke up? Smoke. etc, etc. The goal is not to simply quit smoking, but learn to not associate all of your daily activities with it as well.
I wish you the best of luck and hope you find the strength to quit. I literally have no cravings for them and notice how awful they smell on other people. Just do it cold turkey, that's the best way in my opinion."
"I quit 10 months ago using electronic cig.  a good quality ecigarette and the right flavor is all you need.  Stay away from the drug store crap and get tou a nice one that works.  Spend some time finding a good liquid that suits you and going back to real cigs will make you feel instantly sick.  I use the itaste mvp2 battery, iclear 16 clearomizer, and get all my liquid from  indigo vapor.  I couldnt be forced to smoke another cigarette this thing is so good."
"Pregnancy.  Seriously, the second I found out I stopped.  When I wanted one I would go online and read about all the terrible things smoking does to a fetus and it would make me feel guilty for even thinking about it.  That was a year and a half ago.  I sometimes want to smoke, especially after large meals, but thinking about touching my kid with my smoke hands and breathing my smoke breath on her makes me sad.  And she does everything I do.  EVERYTHING, and it would break my heart to see her pretend smoking :("
[deleted]
"I smoked half a pack a day for about 5 years. 
Cold turkey with change of everyday habits is the only way.  Since smoking is a habit, you'll need to start changing the everyday things that remind you of smoking. 
For instance: I would always have a cigarette at the entrance door to my office building.  So instead of going that way, I would purposely enter the building through the side door.  
I also smoked after lunch.  So to kick that habit, I would take a quick walk afterwards.
Try to stay away from your friends that smoke. I would avoid drinking alcohol for a few weeks. 
Avoid asking strangers for cigarettes."

"I just quit.  I was ready after 15 years of smoking.  I used some cinnamon flavored toothpicks for a few weeks and it was great for the oral fixation but that was it.  I always tell people that unless you are ready to quit mentally,  there's no reason to try.  It's simply motivation and willpower.  Don't try it for anyone else but yourself.  Also, if you are not ready or do not really want to quit... don't try.  It's your life, be happy with who you are.  BTW:  I quit 13 years ago."

http://www.weighdown.com/   this site has classes teaching you how to stop any vise you could ever think of.   And it works.
"I stopped smoking. It worked. I simply said, ""I don't want to die from this shit"" "
"What helped me was stages: Quit smoking in the car, then at home, and then at work. I still smoke occasionally when out with friends after a few adult beverages, but the key is I don't think about cigarettes and don't need cigarettes. Smoking is now a special occasion- a once-a-month kind of treat."

"It made me feel like shit to the point of making smoking unappealing.  Quitting the last time (most smokers quit many tikes, only to pick it back up) was easy because whatever craving of nicotine I had was offset by the sick feeling I have just thinking about smoking a cigarette.  Being winded all the time, having my heart flutter, the constant feeling of stress that high blood pressure gives you all were a direct result of my smoking.
It kind of makes me wonder if a clockwork orange style of aversion therapy would work, like smoking cigarettes with something that made you nautious.  Probably not, but basically the feeling horrible side of my smoking finally won out. "
"The desire to quit first off, and the perspective after this video.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TL2Vh7goJc"
"I recently quit for the second time(a little over two weeks ago) but am feeling stronger this time. The first time I quit I quit cold turkey which lasted a good two months until I got drunk and hit a bumpy road in life, which I figured having just one cig wouldn't hurt. Stupid me. I started back up for another year or so until two weeks ago. This time, I quit smoking cigarettes and quit drinking all types of soda. I quit soda to clear up my face for acting head shots I'm getting done. I believe what really helped me quit easily this time was the fact that I had another addiction to focus on quitting and that let up on me thinking about cigarettes so much. I also used nicotine lozenges for a bit which helped initially but then I wore off them since I didn't want to grow a dependency. I also tried using smoker's patches which was a terrible idea since I threw up with the first patch, seriously don't try it unless you smoke like a motherfucker. Here are a couple other methods I've come across that may help you out.
- Exercise, sweat out the addiction
- Dip whatever cigs you have left in milk just enough so they can dry off within time, now every time you crave a cig, light up one of your milk-cigs. They will smell and taste absolutely repulsive and it should turn the idea of smoking into a bad image. 
- Distract the ""act of smoking"" with something healthier. Some smokers only smoke because they enjoy the act of putting something near their mouths. Replace it with something simple like chewing gum, drinking more water (what I did), chew on a straw, etc. 
- You mentioned your trigger is work, so was mine. Just find things to keep you busy around your work-place. I never stopped finding something to do in order to distract myself from going outside. Also, talk to your boss about getting breaks if you're a non-smoker, everyone is entitled to a break whether or not they smoke. It's ridiculous to say that only smokers can have a break just to feed their addictions. (I had the same problem in my workplace until I brought it up. 
You may have seen these methods before, I just wanted to show what worked well for me. Hope this helped you, best of luck in quitting...again!
Edit: Grammar"
"I was given an ultimatum by my now-husband. When we started getting really serious he told me he couldn't see himself being married to a smoker. He said that 1 of 3 things would happen: 
1) He would start smoking (not an option for me) 
2) We would break up (also not an option) 
3) I would quit smoking
I found something I wanted more than a cigarette, and that was him. I went cold-turkey. Having his support helped a lot, as did sucking on a peppermint whenever I had a craving (my mom swears by blow-pops).
"
"Honestly, I had just started dating this guy that I REALLY liked when my friend jokingly suggested we quit smoking together. He got so happy and said he hadn't wanted to say anything but he hated the taste and smell of smoke. Realizing that my habit was making him uncomfortable and not liking the idea of smelling/tasting bad, I just stopped. Every time I want a cigg I just imagine him about to kiss me and then getting discussed and hugging me instead. I haven't smoked in a year. "
"Discipline. I decided to quit, but didn't throw away my last pack of smokes, it was probably half full. Kept it in my jacket for two months, knowing that I didn't quit due to lack of cigarettes, but due to my own will. This kept me strong enough to keep me from taking one and smoke it.
Oh, and exercise. Took up running. 4 years smoke free now!"
I finished my last pack and then told myself how much money I was wasting on it and also how bad my health was getting. Whether you're old or young its never to late to give it up.
"I quit when my wife got pregnant. Cold turkey. That was 7years ago. I had tried unsuccessfully to quit the same way, even tried gum.. you just really have to want it.
My wife used the 3step nicoderm cq patches, but didn't finish with the final patches, just the first two, she's been cig free for about 3years now.
Sister has been smoke free for almost a year, also cold turkey. Dad quit about 4years ago, same.. mom quit about the time I did. Same way.
Gist of it is, you have to want it.. some people need a little extra jeep, using patches or gum or whatever, but if you don't want to quit, you won't.
With that said, there are still days that I go ""man, wish I had a smoke"" so don't miss yourself into thinking it will be easy to quit.
The best way to quit is to never start.
Edit: fixed some autocorrect issues."
E-cigs for me. I was wanting to quit for years and one day my husband went into a vape shop and bought me an Ego Twist. He brought it home and I was upset that he spent $60 on all of it. In an effort to save money I told myself I would use it until I recouped the $60. Wound up loving it!! Over a year smoke free now.
"Aww look at all the guys in here from /r/stopsmoking. This isn't a bandwagon post or anything is it?
Get a real electronic cigarette, Something mechanical or at least variable voltage. Those shitty little ego devices don't give you enough throat hit or vapor and replacing the coil every day sucks ass.
I'm down to 6mg nicotine with ecigs and I can quit if I want but I'm not noticing any of the ill effects I got with tobacco and my respiratory health is 100% restored. Plus I like the effects of nicotine almost as much as caffeine.
I'm sure I'm going to get a bunch of naysayers but those people don't know what they're talking about and are engaging in confirmation bias to help prove to themselves that they aren't weak willed. "
"I didn't smoke, but I used to chew fairly heavily for about a year. I just decided one day that I didn't like the chains that were around me, constantly having to have a can in my pocket, nicotine cravings if I didn't have any recently, etc, and I went cold turkey. There's an all natural, herbal chew out there that I used one can of and that was it. I was done."
"I had a system to work with. My smoking was pretty much set to a schedule already - 1 on the way to work, 1 during the first break, 1 at lunch, etc. So each week, I would cut one from my schedule until I was down to not smoking at all. It was still difficult, but I felt like that system made the transition a lot less painful for me than it could have been."
"I actually justÛ? quit.  Five years ago.  I smoked my last one, threw away the empty pack, and said ""I'm done.""  Haven't touched them since. "
"2 years without a smoke and still going strong. I did it cold turkey, it was one of the hardest addiction to overcome. Find a good support group, have friendd help you out. It will take a lot of will power and the first 3 months are tough. Good luck!"
"I didn't smoke for as long as others, only like 4 or 5 years. Still was not easy to stop. 
I came home from work one day, and took a 20 minute cat nap. When I woke up, I felt like extreme shit. It was so weird, I was fine 20 minutes earlier. It turned out to be a 24 hour flu type sickness, and the last thing I want to do when I'm sick is smoke. So I decided I was not gunna smoke, and I just stuck to it when I got over the sickness. It has been over 2 years now since then. Now if only I can get my mom and brother to stop. "
"I was lucky, because smoking was disgusting to start for me, i had to work through it, throw up, acquire a taste for it. 
Once i'd taught my body to like it, seriously, there was no hope in hell for me to quit, I was a solid pack and a half a day and I liked it, thought it was cool, felt naked, awkward and retarded to ever talk outside without one in my hand.  
One summer I lived at the bottom of a hill and I was lazy, i was also lonely for awhile, so nobody to mooch off.  After this depressing period of having to climb a mountain to get a smoke I couldn't afford, I dried out by accident.
Then I was back at college and I went outside with friends and took a puff and realized suddenly that it was gross - i needed to smoke, needed to have it in my hand, but fuck was it disgusting.  I realized i had gone long enough without it that I found it unpleasant.
So i had the choice to either smoke through the gross until I liked it again - or endure the terrible pointlessness of human hands without a smoke. 
So I fake smoked. I didn't light them. I still do it when drinking sometimes, its a funny gag with friends i guess.  People approach and try to light my smokes and I accept the offer but aim the cig away from the flame - 9 of 10 times they think they lit my smoke.  When they notice it's out again, I say it's okay, they last longer like this."
"i said to myself that im stronger than this shit. whenever you get a craving, you have to decide, are you a pussy or are you stronger than this"
Don't light one and smoke it.  That worked for me.
"I like to break it down into two phases:
1.  Break the physical habit of reaching for a smoke...carrying a pack, lighter and all of that wonderful stuff.  Do this by using nicotine replacement.  I like the lozenge because it delivers a steady drip of nicotine and satisfies the oral fixation stuff.  This is the easy part (you will still want a good old smoke, but it's tolerable after a week or so).
2.  This is the hard part.  Reduce the number and dose of the lozenges and then quit cold turkey.  The physical withdrawal is awful.  I felt like little people were scratching my eyes from the inside.  Terrible sleep, edgy, etc.  If you can make it for a month you should be golden, but the urge to smoke never totally goes away. 
It's worth it if you can get to the other side.  Best of luck.  "
"Quit cold turkey and started running.
This introduced an immediate consequence for any cigarette I smoked. I'm not sure if it's a physiological thing or perhaps even purely psychological, but when I would smoke a cigarette on a Friday night, I could FEEL it during my run on Sunday."
"after several false starts,exercise,exercise,exercise. In fact I just don't think it is possible without it.every time you want a cig drop and do 20 push ups,or body weight squats and sit ups,that plus a cardio of some sort is the only way i could beat it.also a very engaging piece of media for me i played mass effect 1 and 2 back to back for 2 weeks,I think binge watching a awesome netflix show would be just as good."
"I wish more replies like the one I am going to make were higher up.. quitting cold turkey is definitely one of the hardest ways to quit (imo) and not that effective at all. I mean hell, I tried to quit my PAD Marlboro Red habit cold turkey a few times over the years, and I always ""relapsed"" due to some stressful situation or lack of willpower.
On August 6th, 2013 I bought a vaporizer. Within a week I found cigarettes to smell and taste horribly. My PAD habit has turned in to ZERO a day, my sense of smell and taste returned, my lungs feel better, and my wallet loves me.
Now I get to vape basically wherever I want, whenever I want, using whatever flavor I want, and not bothering anyone at all or really harming myself. Not only that, I have drastically lowered my nicotine intake. In August I was using eJuice that contained 18mg/ml of nicotine. Now I use 6mg/ml."
I never started. Worked like a mother fucking charm. AH HA HA HA HA HA!
"Cold turkey, because my girl hated it.  8 years, and I just stopped."
Will power and choices.
"I actually wanted to stop smoking, so I did. "
"Lived abroad, got paid shit, adopted a puppy, roommate ditched me. Could either afford to pay rent on my own and buy the cigs, or pay rent on my own and buy food and pay vet bills for the puppy. No one knows, but I credit my little girl for helping me cold turkey quit a life threatening habit. "
"This nicotine delivery device really helped me out

"Ecigs! I guess it's not really quitting but it's a hell of a lot better. I do that after smoking 5 years. My mother hasn't had a cigarette in about half a year and she smoked for 40 years. Not the ones that look like cigarettes, the good ones. check out [electronic_cigarette!](http://reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette)"
"I can only go by personal experience. I smoked for over 25 years. I probably started around age 14 -16. The reason being it was what peers were doing. And at the time, It was socially acceptable - enough that adverts were still dominate. I always told myself that I'd never smoke when I was a kid. HA!
I didn't really take notice of the addiction side of smoking until I hit rough times in my 20's. By then I was already smoking a pack a day. It really starts to bother you when you find yourself digging into ashtrays to smoke butts left by other people and/or are bumming cigarettes more than you can afford to buy them for yourself and pissing those people off, that have the same ""habit"".
Even when I didn't have a job, I never made any serious attempts to quit. Oh sure, I would cut down - even as far down as 5 cigarettes a day, but that was mainly because I ""had no choice"". It was my private ball and chain for years.
Recently I noticed something. More accurately, I was missing something that I remembered of my youth. It was practically a nostiglosia  moment for me. When I was a kid, environments were often remembered with scent. How come I don't smell my surroundings now? How come I don't smell that fresh pine? Fall leaves? stomped grass?
It was all because I killed my nose with smoking, and suddenly wanted it back. Oh I did have a smokers cough in the morning sometimes. and my phlegm was a nice tint of brown. More often than not I always had a stuffy nose - filled with more brown gunk. 
None of this mattered though. I was still very hooked. Just another day. Another pack. Another $.$$ out of my wallet. Whatever the price happened to be. 
3 months ago I was browsing reddit as usual and decided to linger in /r/stopsmoking . At the time I was also going through my usual cutting back routine. Someone happened to mention Allen Carr and his book and I decided to take a look out of curiosity. 
What I learned was that I was telling myself incredibly complex lies to excuse and continue my smoking ""habit"". Habit? no. ADDICTION!
In fact its as bad or worse than any other addicted drug. Cutting back is ridiculous. Going from 5 to 1 is surely going to help right? Wrong. You're still getting your 'fix' - just delayed.
Allen Carr's book helped me put those lies to rest and gave me a way to think about smoking while quitting. But I'll warn you here. There's quite a bit of controversy over his book. Some people expect it to be a magic trick or hypotonus. Or think it's too cultish. 90% of his book also  appears to be a bunch of flabber mouthing nonsense - and probably is. Whether or not this was intentional or pure book filler is up for grabs. The truth is that it's no more than a fact book, with tips on what to expect. 
While most methods will push you in ice cold water and let you sink, Carr's book teaches you to slide in and realize it was never that cold to  begin with. 
I'm happy to say I've not touched a cigarette in 3 months. I can smell again. Can now jog 3 miles. And I'm confident I'll never touch another cigarette. They really do smell like shit, even on someones breath. "
I had started working out with a trainer and I hated being out of breath doing simple exercises. Once I stopped the workouts got increasingly easier to last through. Then I got pregnant soooooo that really helped me to not smoke anymore.
I fell in love with a beautiful woman who loved me back but hated that I smoked. I quit cold turkey.
Just go cold turkey and thug the pain of withdrawal like a man. And run a lot.
"My wife and I were about to have a kid. After ten years of a pack a day habit, and trying unsuccessfully in the past to ""smoke in moderation"", I just stopped. Cold turkey, no magic bullet. 
It was tough at first, but then all things are I suppose. I was just at a point where it no longer made sense for me personally, financially, or emotionally to continue smoking. Just over three years now, and I haven't touched a cigarette since. You can't ""cheat just once"", because that isn't how addiction works. E-cigs (and other devices) are bullshit enablers that allow you to bargain with yourself (whenever I say this the friggin pitchfork brigade of apologists storm my inbox... so, I'm ready for that).
It gets easier, and in the end, you will be (most likely) really glad that you are no longer an addict."
"My boyfriend used an herb called Kratom. It effects the same neurotransmitters that nicotine does so it almost 'replaces' it and gives the user a chance to have relief from an assortment of symptoms. He was no longer depressed, anxious and could re-learn how to do everything much easier. He's been smoke free for 14 months now! "
"What worked for me: The patches. Started with the strongest ones as I smoked a pack a day. Great dreams! But anyways it was hard that first week. Honestly I drank a lot. Not beer, because what goes together better than a beer and a cig. Straight shots. I would get pretty beligerant and pass out. But after a week or so I started forgetting about holding the cig. Then I started getting nicotine overdoses from the patches. Started feeling really weird. So I stepped down. Then I realized wtf, I don't need these at all! And 8 years later here we are
**tl;dr** Patches, drank a lot first week, overdosed on nicotine from patches, never went back.
Hope this helps!"
I myself didn't do it but my parents. They both woke up in the middle of the night sometimes because i was a bitch at night when i was a baby. And they found out they ran out. And drove to the pumping station......at 3 in the morning.....They then realized how stupid it was and just quit. never again smoked after that...that was 21 years ago.
ITT: don't be a bitch just quit
"Buproprion HCl (Wellbutrin) - It's primarily used as an anti-depressant but studies have shown it is very effective as a smoking cessation aid. [e.g. this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528204/) 
It effectively kills any nicotine buzz you get, so smoking just becomes pointless. "
"I started dipping Kodiak when I was 12, I quit on Christmas eve 5 weeks ago. I was done, picked the day, calculated how much money I had spent (about $60,000) and called my Dr. I was on Chantix for the first 2 weeks, thought I was going to go insane, but now it seems to be going well. I have dreams that I am dipping and then wake up pissed, but I feel great, I have lost 10 lbs and am literally $245 richer. I have also found that having your loved ones monitor you like a fat kid in a candy store helps. Good luck internet friend person."
"I'm at three months right now, and it's still a struggle almost everyday. With that being said, having the support of my loved-ones is what eventually helped me try to quit. It has been working for me so far."
"I was a heavy smoker for about 12 yrs, a I wanted to quit when my wife became pregnant. What worked for me was the motivation not to pollute my wife and kids combined with aversion therapy. A weekend blow out which involved copious amounts of drinking and smoking and resulted in a week long hangover. For those six or seven days the mere thought of smoking or if an ashtray made me physically ill. The aversion aspect is a  high risk method but I haven't smoked for 10 yrs "
"Dad used a pretty special technique to stop... get really sick. Dad stopped first he just got a fever and got too tired to go out to smoke, and when he got healthy the worst part was over so he just decided to stop, after over 30 years of smoking."
"There is someone I love more than I could ever love myself. I realized that smoking would eventually kill me and would make her sad. I want to spend as much time with her as I can so I stopped. 
If you are dating someone or are thinking of having children-I think it would be extremely selfish to leave this life early. That being said I am going to start smoking again when I'm too old for the cancer to catch me :-) "
"An uncle of mine did it by accident. He was up for three days working. Fell asleep for eighteen hours. Woke up without a craving, never smoked another cigarette.
For me, it was mostly the cold, and laziness. At some point I looked up and realized I couldn't smoke in my apartment. Couldn't smoke in the office. Didn't want to stand there in the freezing cold to smoke. Friends were complaining about the smell in my car, plus the cold. 
I counted the cigarettes I was smoking each day. Started at maybe eight (I was never a real big smoker). Got rid of the pain-in-the-ass ones, like where you're standing outside of the building or having to go downstairs. Then I got rid of the habitual ones, like the every-time-I-get-in-the-car ""I didn't even really want this"" cigarettes. 
So now I'm down to the gotta-have-a cigarettes. The moments of high-stress, at the end of a night of drinking, after a big meal. I don't not smoke cigarettes, but I smoke maybe 20 cigarettes a month. It's not perfection, and will not work for everyone, but that's how I did it."
"I moved to good ol' scorching hot Phoenix, Arizona!!! I'd rather NOT SMOKE than go outside here in the summer. Just not worth it, so I quit!"
"I quit 4 years ago.  I did it cold turkey with a great deal of motivation; let me explain.  I broke my neck and the doctor essentially refused to operate if I didn't promise to quit.  Also the nurses refused to wheel me downstairs to smoke.  And finally, I found out my wife was pregnant about 2 months later  (that is to say two months into not smoking).  It sucked for a year and then it sucked less.  I barely think about it now.
TL:DL Cold Turkey with a great deal of motivation.  "
 I didn't smoke for 4 days straight but called out of work for 3 days so.I didn't snap on anyone. It was hard but once I got through it I didn't think about smoking anymore 
"Hi! I don't post often but I wanted to weigh in, even if this get buried.
I support the cold turkey method. I made a bet with my girlfriend, that the next person to smoke a cigarette had to buy the other one the most expensive boat of sushi they could find. We love sushi, but FUCK THAT IM GUNNA WIN THIS BET. She thinks the same. It's been over a year now and neither one of us has had even a drag. Actually, I find it pretty gross these days. 
Good luck dude!"
"I didn't smoke for a very long time, and it didn't take me long to realize that it was turning into a bad habit. So I simply said ""I'm not going to spend any more money on cigarettes"" and that curbed my usage to the point that it became manageable.
Edit: I smoked for about 2 years."
"I just stopped.  After 8 years of 1-2 packs a day, I said enough is enough and just...stopped.  Once you come to the decision and you are 100% that it is what you want, then it's just up to you to put mind over matter.  Stop it!"
The Patch.  Makes you have the most vivid dreams ever if you put a fresh one on at night.
Smoked for 25 years. Read Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking and never looked back. I liked that it encouraged me to continue smoking while I read. I also liked it because it appealed to my way of thinking about addiction and gave me mental tools to cope with quitting. While any way of quitting is acceptable as long as you quit. This book details why using gums and other nicotine supplements only make it harder.
"Cold Turkey, Quit almost 3 years ago. I have had a few smokes(like maybe 5~6 in 3 years) when drinking. Hookah occasionally when my roommates use it. I did abstain from tobacco for 2 years before I did either one of those. Neither one makes me run out and buy a pack. I wouldn't recommend it though. Quitting was the best thing I ever did."
"I stopped craving it during the day, so that part was easy. I still craved it when I was drunk, so for about two years I only smoked when I was drunk. Then I chain-smoked with a friend of mine during a drunk night, and was sick for two weeks afterwards with a cold and bad cough. Haven't gotten a craving since then. 
I'm aware that this isn't actually a method of quitting. My mom smoked for years, and one day just stopped wanting it and quit, too.
EDIT: I also never had the hard time dealing with the craving that everyone talks about. The only times I wanted a cigarette was when a routine came up that I used to smoke during, such as driving, during a good song, etc."
"Probably not available to you, but for me, it was Demerol that was the key to my ability to quit. Surgery complications meant that I had about a two-week supply of Demerol for pain, and I'm convinced that's what got me through the worst of the physical withdrawals. After that, it was just one day at a time, like AA. I'd wake up and say to myself, ""Just for today, you're not going to smoke."" And I did that every single day until it was no longer necessary. That was 15 years ago, and now I'm one of those obnoxious, rabid non-smokers who has zero tolerance for the smell. "
"I quit one situation at a time. First, I quit smoking in my bathroom. Then I quit smoking in my living room. Then I quit smoking in my kitchen. Then I quit smoking in my office. Then I quit smoking everywhere but outside. Then I quit smoking outside. "
"Chantix. That drug face me the worst insomnia and nightmares, and I only took it for four days. With every craving that hits, I see the blood dropping off my child's arm in that dream and vomit. No more smoking for me. "
"/ragequit, first time I used that function in my brain for a positive outcome."
The patch and a bad memory. 
"In my personal experience with quitting cigarettes, my friend and I decided that we both wanted to stop before we became adults and it had really settled into our lives. I was 17 at the time and had been smoking for about 3 years as well as my amigo. We both figured that the best way to do it was to chain smoke cigarettes until we couldn't smoke anymore. From that point on that was it, no more cigarettes. I think that having a friend doing it with me really encouraged me not to give up because I didn't want to be the weak one. 
I think the driving force to quit really has to be yourself. You have to say no every single time or else you're just giving in to your temptations. The use of nicotine supplements can only help so much before they leave you in denial that you have quit. Quitting cold turkey isn't for everyone, but being able to say no after your quit date is difficult but completely possible
"
Cold turkey and will power. 
I went cold turkey BUT I bought an e - cig and used it when I was getting to the point of breaking down and buying a pack. I only used the e - cig about 5 times in total and I would only take a couple of puffs. I haven't smoked in 2 years now. Hope that helps. Good luck to you! 
I girlfriend told me it was gross. I couldn't argue it. I knew I had to quit at some point and it was rough at first since a lot of my friends smoke. Even made it despite them offering me cigarettes every once in awhile. I just had a streak going and once it was a few weeks I didn't want to break it. It's basically will power. I've seen so many people fail trying other methods. You have to want to be done. 
"I got the flu one winter and my throat was way too sore to smoke, it wasnt even an option.  10 days later when I was finally healthy I realized that I had ""quit"" almost two weeks ago.  I decided to go with it, having already been through the toughest days of quitting.  That was in 2001."
I actually like smoking so it was hard for me to find an alternative. I use a vape pen with nicotine juice and flavoring. I went from a pack a day to not wanting one at all in less than 2 weeks. Interested? 
"Just stop buying them.  Form some kind of punishment if you violate the rule like donating the same amount of money you paid for the pack to charity.  While donating to charity is great, that money loss will get tiresome pretty quickly.  "
"Innate cheapness and a monetary award. This worked for me about 20 years ago. I was smoking about a pack a day, spending five bucks a pack. I took a two-liter plastic bottle, and first thing each morning I put a $5 bill in the bottle and told myself, ""Well, can't buy smokes today - I already 'spent' my $5."" At the end of a year I sliced the bottle open - and rewarded myself with $1825.00 to spend however I wished. That nearly TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS that had been going (figuratively) up in smoke. The combination of a year to break the habit, the monetary reward,  and the realization of the waste of money did the trick for me; I haven't touched a cigarette since."

Having high blood pressure. It was either quit or have a massive stroke!
"I used niquitin patches 24mg for 1st week, 2nd week 14mg and 3rd week 7mg worked perfectly I didn't need a cigarette at all been a non-smoker for 9months now."
"I slowly cut back until I was at three or four smokes a day. Then, cold turkey. It was difficult, but I did it. "
"I quit smoking over five years ago on my first attempt.  I was a fairly heavy smoker -- 20+ a day.  I smoked for 10 years. I quit by replacing my addiction with nicotine gum, which I chewed with varying levels of madness for about 3 years.  Finally, I transitioned from the gum to the patch and started chewing non-nicotine gum.  The key for me was taking the control out of my hands in terms of when the nicotine came into my system. It wasn't easy, and there is no one way to quit.  For me, focusing on increased physical activity was an important piece.  Ultimately you have to just stop being chickenshit and make a bold move.  Try a few different tactics. Some might not work at first. Keep trying.  Smoking is fucking corny."
"Don't bring cigs outside with you. Just fucking go outside and take a 3 minute break. It might ""feel"" like you can't take a break without lighting up but it isn't reality. It's not even legal in the US. If others get a smoke break, you get a break break. Talk to HR if its an issue with management. 
There was a guy on here years ago that brought one of those little jars of bubble solution outside for his smoke breaks. Just blew bubbles for 3 minutes while other employees smoked.  At least it's something to do.  Grab a book. Download a podcast. 
Break the pattern!  In my mind ecigs are crap and not tested for long term health results.  Plus they just keep the behavior loop going. "
I started smoking at 15 during my freshman year in high.  I smoked for 20 years and tried everything. Until Chantix came along...I had to quit drinking for a few months (it was a trigger) but that wasn't a big deal. It was one of the easiest things I've ever managed to do. I am now 4 years smoke free (except for the occasional stogie).
"My girlfriend made a deal with me.  She won't have sex with me if she can smell smoke on my breath... I'll also tell her when I failed and had a smoke because I'm tragically honest.  Anyway, 16 months later it turns out I like sex WAY more than tobacco."
"I quit smoking cold turkey on October 1. Every time I attempted to quit in the past I gained weight which would lead me back to smoking. This time, the day I quit I also started a fitness program. A friend of mine had amazing results doing the Insanity program so that's what I chose. I also started eating small meals every couple of hours and counting my calories. Small meals eliminates the unhealthy snacking habits I fell into during previous attempts AND gives me those little sanity breaks I used to get when I would step outside to smoke. Diet and exercise gave me something else to focus on, improved my mood, and, for the first time ever, I actually lost weight when I quit! I still think about it occasionally but I look and feel so much better than I have in years that it's easy to brush those thoughts aside. "
"Went cold turkey after waking up New Years Day with a horrible sore throat from smoking maybe 30 to 40 in six hours (difficult to keep track when you're handing them out)
It's one of those things, like other people in this thread, I tried patches and gum etc but they just didn't work for me but they worked for others I know. I think one thing that needs to be mentioned however is that a few people will quit first time, others wont. This is probably the third time I've quit, you've just got to power through whatever triggered the relapse, and begin again.
EDIT: Spelling"
"Think about the money. Today it's $5.25 times 30 days, add in interest, think about retirement, think how much money of yours they have, think about paying for lunch, stay focused on the money. "
"I tried giving up a number of times before I found a method that worked. The hardest part of giving up, IMO, is that when you stop smoking it actually changes a habit which is central to your lifestyle. As any smoker who drinks or works in the service industry knows, there are moments in the day in which a cigarette 'fits' and when you give up it's not just the nicotine you miss but the routine. In other words, you associate cigarettes with many other things in your life.
The problem with going cold turkey is that you are not just trying to stop smoking, you are simultaneously reordering important patterns in your life and breaking associations without compensating for it. The other problem with cold turkey is that it puts you 'on the wagon' so that when you fall off, the temptation is to go 'ah fuck it' and just start lighting up. If you set up huge numbers in your head (e.g. 35 days without a cigarette) it makes the failure that much more painful if (and most likely, when) it occurs.
So in order to avoid the damage to habit and the psychological stress of cold turkey I used a slow weaning process where I gradually changed both my habits around smoking while also slowly getting myself off them.
 
It had a number of phases:
1. I gradually reduced my smoking from 20 a day to about 3/4 a day. That was my first goal.  
2. Once I got there, I tried to cut down to smoking only at 'key' habit moments (such as a 5 minute break at work, or when drinking) but to forgo them at other times (and still not exceed 3/4 a day). This reduced my intake to about 10 a week.
3. Then I allowed myself a limited number of cigarettes at key moments and no cigarettes at other times. So, for instance, I would go out on a Saturday night and say ""I am allowed to have 3."" This had the effect of reassuring myself that I was allowed to smoke, but made me save it up, so to speak.
4. I cut that number down to 2 and then 1 cigarette. This meant I could still go out, still reassure myself that I was allowed to smoke and so avoid the stress. However, what naturally started to happen was I would ""save"" that cigarette until closing time.
One night, about nine years ago, I was sitting on the balcony of a bar that had its lights on while the staff were clearing everyone out and I was 'letting' myself have my cigarette and thought, ""I am not even enjoying this."" From then on I stopped smoking.
Now, bear in mind, I have probably smoked approx 30 cigs since then till now, but they have been at big parties or when hammered or whatever. The key thing is I broke the habit and CRITICALLY the associations that cigarettes had in my life.  Consequently, it would be very hard for me to start smoking again.
BTW, the whole process - from 20 a day to none - took about 7 or 8 months. 
TL;DR: One of the main problems of smoking is the associations you create between smoking and other things, and the danger off 'falling off the wagon.' I came up with an approach that broke the associations and never psychologically put me on a wagon to begin with.
"
"Cold turkey for me. I was fed up with spending tons of money (half pack a day easy), smelling like shit, having people not want to be around me when I smoke, and the most influential cause was the severe impact it had on my health. I had started gaining weight in college and wanted to lose weight and get fit and stop being sick. I quit smoking and started exercising and I've never been more fit in my life. Although I cheat once in a while and have a cigarette when I'm drinking with my buddies. But that's once a month at best. "
I went cold turkey myself. But a friend of mine who had smoked for almost ten years told me that what finally got her to quit was a picture of healthy human lungs next to a set from a lifelong smoker from cadavers. The image scared her so much that she was able to taper off and quit. 
"Psychedelics, specifically LSD. I tripped twice about a week apart, and a few days after decided that I no longer wanted to smoke.  It really was that simple, as easy as choosing what clothes you want to wear in the morning or what to have for breakfast.   "
"Once I was really ready, I used the patch.  It made me afraid to smoke because of all the warnings about it killing me if I did.  I basically built it up in my head that if I smoked within an hour of taking the patch off, bad things would happen.  I used the patch for a week and by the end of it, I knew I was done smoking.
Also, and I hate to sound cliche, but you really have to be ready mentally.  That's the biggest battle.  You have to have a distraction plan.  Most urges don't last long as long as you don't dwell on it.  If you feel like you want one, change your scenery, even if it's just a walk to the bathroom.  
You have to stay away from as many triggers as possible.  There's nothing that says you can't go out to the parking lot during work and walk a lap or 2.  If the smokers get the break, so do the non-smokers.  Bring a bottle of water and walk.  
It also helped that I found out I was pregnant 2 months after I quit.  I still get the occasional urge, even almost 4 years later...then I see how much they cost and the urge goes away.
Good luck!  You can do it!"
"I got engaged and made a promise to not smoke for a while. When you love someone, you'll do anything for them. Long story short, we're no longer together so I'm on and off smoking. "
Tapering down. 
"I had been considering it for a long time. I failed about 12 or so times to quit. 
I had about two weeks off from work, finished off my pack and went for a walk to the store to buy smokes when I simply decided now was the time. 
It was probably the toughest three days in my immediate memory. Every time I felt a strong craving, I would go climbing at the gym until I was too exhausted to care. After a week, it got easier. After a month I was no longer thinking about it daily. 
After two months of being smoke free, I started running. That was the motivation I needed to carry on. 
Now I know if I start again, I have to give up the running, my climbing will decline and I would have to go through the three days of hell all over again. 
Also, I used the ""Since iQuit"" app. It's been 8 months and I've saved $2000 dollars (smokes are $13 a pack in Alberta). "
Add up how much you spend a month on cigs. Worked for me
"It's already been said that simply not smoking anymore is the way to go (cold). It's hard, and it will suck a little. You know the main reason people don't quit or revert? It's easy to smoke, easy to cave. What you need to do is not be a pussy. You're not going to die from withdrawal. Man up.
3 years on the 15th of February and I smoked for 25."
For me it was when I started to exercise heavily again. I hated running (and still do) but could feel my lungs being incredibly over worked. I eventually started to feel that every time I smoked I was in effect cancelling out the hard work I had gone through working out. 
By stopping. Jan 8th 2011 I had my last one and didn't have another one.
I only smoke when I drink and I only drink on my days off
"I had bronchitis so bad that I couldn't breathe well enough to smoke. Figured I'd have a smoke in a week or two when I could breathe again, and by that time I didn't want one anymore. I was too miserable from being sick to even notice withdrawal. "
"The best way to stop is to never start. Seriously, fellow highschoolers and younger, please for the love of god don't start. Way to many of my buddies smoke tobacco and it is fucked. It isn't cool, it isn't good, it is bad. It makes you fucking stink, even through your prepubescent scented AXE.
And if you are desperate enough to start smoking cigarettes in the locker room, you have a serious problem."
" This will probably sound ridiculous but the way I quit was by smoking cannabis every time I felt like a cigarette. Obviously you might find your self smoking cannabis a bit more and you might find it a little inappropriate at times but after 3 or 4 weeks and didn't feel the need for a cigarette anymore. 
Occasionally on nights out I will have a cigarette or 10 but the next day i feel kind of ashamed of my self for doing it."
Not buying any. Seriously just dont walk into a store and buy them. Its that simple. 
"This book: books.google.com/books/about/The_Easy_Way_to_Stop_Smoking.html?id=cN_xAuodABgC
There's usually a pdf of it floating around on huge internet. I tried everything before that (nothing worked) but reading this book did the trick.  "
"I quit cold turkey and used a couple methods to help me through the first couple weeks. 
It's good to occupy your mouth with something when having a craving, I used jolly ranchers. I could bite down on them and they lasted long enough to get me through the craving, plus helped redirect my oral fixation. After a couple weeks I switched to gum, since all that sugar isn't that great for you either. 
I also got a large clear vase and put it in a spot that I saw several times a day, the island in my kitchen. Every time I would have normally bought a pack if cigarettes, for me it was every other day, I put that cash in the vase, and used it as incentive to buy myself something I really wanted. 
I made a list of all the reasons I wanted to quit and taped it to my mirror. 
Also, no matter what the situation, DO NOT think you can have just one! It's not worth it, and it can easily send you back to regular smoking. 
Good luck! It's a tough thing to do, but it is so worth it! "
"I had really good luck with Chantix one time I quit.  I went back to smoking well after the Chatnix was over, so I don't accuse it of failing.  Also, I didn't freak out and kill anyone either, which is a bonus.
That said, I decided at 37, after 25 years of smoking and on the precipice of my daughter's birth, I was done.  I had to be.  
I used patches for about 10 weeks.  It totally fucking sucked ass, but (sounds corny) I made a commitment that my daughter would never know me as a smoker.  I quit October 4, 2011, she was born about a month later, and I haven't had a cigarette since.  I thinks about smoking a lot, even still.  But every day gets easier.  I miss it, but I also miss being 12 and playing in the creek, or being 17 and going to prom or or being 29 and thinking that was sooooo old.  That ship has sailed; just fond memories now.  You can do it - really.  You have what you need already; just let yourself.
**TL;DR - you just have to be ready; really fucking mentally ready to be done.**"
"The first thing I did was quit smoking my favorite cigs.  The one right when I woke up, the on right after I ate, etc.  That was the hard part.  Then I gradually cut down, one cig every hour.  One cig every 2 hours.  After I was good with that, I stopped.  I had enough practice with fighting cravings that it was much easier at that point...they still smell good 2 years later though.  Hahaha."
"Lobelia worked for me but only after years of tapering off my smoking habit. I stopped smoking in the house, then the car. I got down to 2 or 3 a day. Lobelia is chemically similar to nicotine but has a side effect that makes the smell of cigarettes repulsive."
"Champix worked really well for me. No cravings even after I stopped taking it. It was nice. Cold turkey, minus the anxious sweats and shakes, I personally highly recommend it. 
Until one day, working a shutdown at a refinery, being two and a half months in with a total of 6 days off in total, and running on fumes, I made the mistake of walking through the smoke pit. The yearning of the smell never goes away, and I couldn't fight it.
Was the best 2 years in recent memory until that point. I'll probably do it again here soon. But I found it worked, and I loved the wild dreams. "
"Both my wife and I stopped at the same time using CHAMPIX tablets from the doctor. It was a course of about 8 weeks, the first pack of 2 weeks worth built you up to full dosage then it gradually declined as you worked through hue he course.
The idea was to commit to taking the tablets, nothing more. We both had a real desire to quit, but the doctor told us ""just take the tablets and don't worry about setting a quitting date.""
It was about 5 days in to the course that I stopped smoking, my wife was the following day. It's not like there was a sort of epiphany or light bulb moment, I just found myself not smoking and not even thinking about smoking!
That was a little over 3 years  ago and I honestly can't think of the last day I thought about lighting up. It just never crosses my mind. 
Oh, I smoked at least 20 a day for about 20 years, although I was on very mild cigs by the end.
CHAMPIX were great, though I do remember feeling slightly nauseous but that may have been withdrawal symptoms. The best decision I have ever made was committing to taking those tablets.
As for my wife, she also stopped although she sometimes says she misses smoking. I think it's the idea of taking a quick break for a smoke; it's the breaks she misses, not the smoke. I get that, smoking is often a group event!"
"Smoked for 10 years or so, I quit over the course of a month or two
First by cutting smoking out of my car completely, I'd usually have two on my way to and from work, as well as lighting one up every time I got in the car. I also started buying 20 packs as opposed to 25s
Then I gave myself a budget of only about $20 a week for smokes. I was a pack a day smoker so this wasn't easy and basically allowed me 4 shitty packs, or two packs of a brand I enjoyed (Belmont Milds)
It wasn't too bad going this route, but the hardest was not smoking when out drinking, so I simply stopped getting drunk every weekend for a couple months."
Getting addicted to videogames made me quit.
I smoked until the day I heard my name and cancer in the same sentence. Cancer cured my smoking.
"Not sure if it will work for everyone because I only smoked for 5 years.  My method:  Used the patch for the nicotine and carried toothpicks with me for the physical addiction of holding something in my hands and holding in my mouth.  Can use the same motions with a toothpick.  This help around my friends that smoked.  After I kicked the nicotine addiction, toothpicks were easy to put down."
"I quit cold turkey after 13 years. I had finally had enough and I read Alan Carr's book and it helped me change my outlook. That mixed with the support of the fine folks over at /r/stopsmoking, I'm almost 200 days smoke free now. My big realization was that I had brainwashed myself into thinking smoking gave me something that it actually did not. I gave it credit for things which were really just part of life, smoker or otherwise. I tricked myself into thinking it was hard to stop and that life wouldn't be the same after quitting."
chantix helped for me. but I am still addicted to nicotine and chew the gum and lozenges regularly. it's expensive but at least I am not smoking. 
"strong will + the nicorette spray, which I have now transitioned to the gum (which I still chew)"
Pretty much all my friends smoke. I quit a year and a half ago or so cold turkey. For me it was actually finding a girl who wants me to be around long enough and be healthy. 
"Was in Thailand and saw one of those gross out pictures on the pack. Thought about it and realized I smoked to be a rebel but I was finding that I was becoming dependent on it. I made the decision to quit 12 days ago, I just hope I have the strength never to light up ever again."
"I quit a year ago using a quality e-cig and I have no desire to smoke cigarettes again.  I've also lowered the nicotine twice and my next step is to go nicotine free by the summer.  
I love vaping the juice and I'll keep using it for a while. "
"Just don't smoke.
Now, I will admit that I still have the odd ciggy when I've been out for a meal and drink, but I can just have the one ever couple of months and enjoy it and that's it.
I could never really understand the attraction of smoking though.  I smoked regularly for years but only a few a day and with the gradual price rise the gaps between them just got bigger and bigger until I was getting a pack at the weekend and then eventually just stealing other peoples' on a night out."
Vaping
"Honestly, I got so pissed off at myself that I had failed to quit so many times that I threw them all out the window and refused to buy more. I guess attempting to punish myself (kinda weird I know). But my big triggers were drinking and long drives. Quit drinking and that helped a lot but my long drives were pretty difficult. Some days it still hits me pretty hard. "
"To be honest, I just quit cold turkey. The first couple of weeks were hard: shaking, cold sweats, anxiety attacks. But, once you suffer through it, it's as easy as telling yourself that the craving for a cigarette passes in about three minutes. Just man the eff up and do it. "
Cold turkey with a friend. We each put in $10 into a bucket every day. If the one of us smoked then the other would get all the money. 
A nasty cold the day after my wedding and a build up of pure fury at tobacco companies making more money every year while I got poorer and sicker death would follow and they would never notice or care...still makes me mad.
"Cold turkey but I also immediately descended into a douche bag non smoker who ridiculed smoking friends. For me it was sort of a mechanism to raise my ""social level"" to where if I began smoking again I was guilty of all the grief I had sewn and I would deserve the blowback should I be seen smoking by a previously ridiculed smoker friend at the bar. "
Cold turkey worked for me.
Ecigs. Get a decent setup and combine yourself you don't need cigs. Many people slowly ween themselves off traditional cigs this way. Head over to /r/electroniccigarette for more info.
ACTUALLY STOPPING.
getting pregnant
"Being diagnosed with coronary artery disease after smoking tobacco and ganja for twenty five years. Couldn't stand the idea of smoking after that. Stopped suddenly and never picked it up again. 
It's actually pretty easy to stop when you have to."
"My job requires me to ask clients why they quit smoking, if they used to smoke.  By far, the most common answer I get is ""I was driving my truck to work one morning, went to light one up, and it tasted bad.  I threw that pack out the window and never lit up again.""  It's always in the car/truck, on the way to work in the morning.  Point is, they didn't try to quit - their bodies just told them ""Enough."""
"25y/o here--started smoking at 13--heavily at 15 (pack a day)--Crazy I know..  
I started Chantix in January 2013.  After about 2 weeks I had zero physical cravings.  After I stopped taking it, I would still have mental cravings when I was driving, or when I saw friends smoke.  But, I have not gone back since. 
I don't know if I was just lucky, but I had a great experience with Chantix-- maybe one or two vivid dreams (not nightmares)..and that is it.  No suicidal thoughts or depression, yada yada yada.... 
I am not some secret online marketer promoter for Chantix, I promise--but it worked REALLY well for me and I would highly recommend it.
Its like 300 bucks, and at least last year, my insurance didn't cover it.  But in the long run its really worth it.  My bro is on it now so we will see how it works for him. "
"It started to affect my quality of life so I quit cold turkey.  It was impeding my ability to do the things I wanted to do.  Whenever I begin to consider smoking again, I remind myself why I quit.  The reasons are substantial.  I wouldn't have been able to quit otherwise."
"The short answer is cold turkey, but it's a bit more complicated than that.  
I've been trying to quit for a couple years.  I started with e cigarettes but at the end, I felt like I was using it as an excuse to ""smoke"" indoors and I still was reaching for the real thing outside - although I was smoking less.  The patches worked for a while for me.  I went a good month on patches not touching a cigarette.  But in the end, I gave back in.  
For me to finally stop, it took a wholesale change in my behavior.  When I got a new job, moved to a new town and got a new place, I took that opportunity to reestablish my habits.  I decided that this town wasn't going to be one where I smoked.  The little ticks like reaching for one as soon as I step outside, I actively tried to replace (taking a really exaggeratedly deep inhale).  I made sure there wasn't one in my vicinity so that even when I wanted one, it'd be a pain in the ass for me to get.  I'm going 4 months strong and I think I'm gonna make it."
"Ecigs. But not those shitty ones you get in the mall or gas station. They suck, and they're owned by Phillip Morris and other big tobacco companies anyway. And don't believe the BS about not knowing about safety. While it's true there hasn't been inhalation studies on all the fda approved flavorings, there isn't actually much in there. It's mostly propylene glycol, which there have been TONS of studies on the inhalation effects, all of which say the worst is a little irritation after copious amounts. Source: I'm a chemist and had access to literature databases. The fda was basically straight up lying in the early days. Now they just focus on the flavorings. But if you're really all that concerned just get unflavored. Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine actually taste pretty good on their own. 
Ecigs allow you to have nicotine (which on its own is no more dangerous than caffeine) and to wean yourself down to no nicotine. It also allows you to have the oral fixation effect, which was always my biggest problem with quitting. Car rides were boring, sitting at my desk too long made me antsy. Now a puff or two of my ecig takes care of that. 
After a good deal of experimentation and lots of money spent, I believe I have an ideal setup for the average user. Look for the following online, there's always deals to be had everywhere:
**Battery:** eGo-C twist. The short one is closer to cigarrillo size, but less battery. The larger one is cigar sized, maybe slightly smaller. Some smokers are initially put off by the size and want a smaller one. Just trust me on this one. The size won't bother you at all after a day of use. 
**Atomizer/tank:** this is what holds and vaporizes the juice.  My preference is for the Kanger Evod. Although if you don't mind something a little bigger with much better features, such as the air intake not being next to the battery connection, which sometimes resulted in leaks causing connection issues, check out the Kanger Aerotank. 
**Juice**: now this is a tough one, because it's all personal preference. The ecig community has always raved about Backwoods Brews ejuice. And for good reason, it's awesome. Now you're never going to find something that tastes exactly like a cigarette. Just accept that. Because there are tons of awesome flavors. I suggest the Applewood tobacco. Anything mint and mocha is always good too. And if you were a menthol smoker, you're in luck, because menthol cigarettes just taste like menthol anyway, and there are tons of menthol based flavors out there. So just try a bunch of small sample sizes before you settle on your all-day vape. When in doubt with a juice vendor, try their RY4. It is a unique chocolate tobacco flavor that pretty much every vendor has their own version of and it's almost always good. For something lighter, search for RY3.
Hope that helps. Feel free to PM me with any questions. I know wayy too much about this stuff at this point. "
I'm only 18 and i started smoking occasionally just because I had could finally purchase cigarettes myself. I told myself I wouldn't get addicted but found myself smoking every day. I told myself I needed to quit and after talking to some guys at work who smoke packs a day it really helped me realize how bad the addiction could become. I just stopped purchasing cigarettes altogether and haven't smoked in a long time now.

"Cold turkey.... Slowed down like the last year I was smoking then the gf told me it was her or the cigs, and I said her not only because she did this but because I was only killing myself. Honestly I haven't gone the full 2years with out a drag off a cigarette but I've been 2 years without buying them and I haven't smoke a full cigarette since. Also I've gone 6 months plus without so much as a drag off a cigarette.... I just slip up when I'm drunk and take a couple drags off a buddy's. But let me tell you the wanting of a cigarette never goes away. And that's not just my word I've known other that say the craving never goes away... It subsides sometimes but if you get stressed the first thing that always comes to mind is. GIVE ME THAT CIGARETTE. Also I was a smoker for about 8 years which isnt even that bad. I'm just glad I changed for the better. Honestly it wasn't that hard either just realize you are only killing yourself and paying for it.... That just seems dumb."
"I'm sure this will get buried. I have now quit for almost one year after smoking for about 15 years. I have tried quitting a couple other times with varying success. The only thing that has ever worked is cold turkey. 
What has worked for me this time. I changed some of my routines to avoids triggers. You will still get triggered but it helps some. I also got an app on my phone that keeps track of the amount of time I have quit, how many cigarettes I haven't smoked, and most importantly how much money I have saved. Most importantly just will power. I decided I wanted to not smoke more than I wanted to smoke. You have to quit because you want to, not because you think you should. If your heart isn't in it, it isn't going to work. "
"Tapered those nicotine lozenges.  I also wanted to quit, so when my taper was at crumbs I was done.  You still get that smidge of a craving, but i is A LOT less than what it would have been when I was at a full lozenge.
I think I'd still be smoking if I did cold turkey because I have a personality where I get hooked on things easily."
"I was suddenly and overwhelmingly terrified of dying from a smoking related illness. I stopped immediately. Mentally it was so easy but I knew it was going to be difficult physically. To help myself I bought a load of apples and rice cakes. For the first week or so, whenever I felt like I wanted a cigarette I ate an apple or rice cake. The craving went away totally after about 3 weeks. I have not smoked for about 11 years but I have the odd dream where I have started again, even though I absolutely do not want or need a cigarette. I guess they are just dreams about life the same as any other. I don't consider myself a smoker who doesn't smoke, I consider myself a non-smoker and try to forget that I ever did."
"I started smoking ""socially"". I wouldn't really go buy a pack and smoke on my own, but anytime I'd be out drinking or out with friends who smoked, I'd have one or two. That eventually turned into a pack a day habit that lasted for a few years. 
I tried quitting a bunch of times throughout those few years. I tried cold turkey a few times and nicotine patches a few times. The longest I made it any of those times was maybe a month (and I hated everything by the end of that month). 
I've been a non smoker again since August 8th, 2013. And ultimately, it was going cold turkey. BUT. I had help this time. It sounds crazy, but I read a book by Alan Carr called ""Easy Way to Quit Smoking"". The title makes it sound like a gimmick, but I came home one day and decided enough was enough, so I read through the book in one sitting. After i finished that book, it was still challenging at times, but I felt like i had a different mindset about it and like I was better equipped to deal with the cravings that soon disappeared."
Vape pen.
Gum for two years during the week and only smoking on the weekends. Then I decided that was stupid. So I quit. Though I did wait until a week where my girlfriend was on a business trip and my boss was on vacation. 
"I didn't read any of the other comments, but: E-Cig. /r/electronic_cigarette is a great community."
Not drinking. 
"My cat died suddenly of lung cancer, and helping him through the last few weeks of his life was emotionally devastating. Shortly after that I got really sick with a chest cold and decided it was time to quit for good. Been smoke free for 9 months now!
*please note - I never, ever smoked indoors around my pets so my kitty getting lung cancer wasn't caused by that. "
Pretty sure I had a minor heart attack during my morning smoke years ago. Haven't touched a cig since.
Smoking a lot of pot help me quit
"Smoked for 6 years before I came to the realization that I really didn't even enjoy them anymore. I didn't pick a date I just said ""This is my last pack. I've got to improve my run time and I'm only smoking because I'm so used to it by this point."" I caved a couple times. Bought a pack while drinking. Bummed a cigarette here or there on stressful days at work, but cold turkey worked for me. You have to remember why you're quitting but don't constantly think about it and before you know it two weeks has gone by and the urge has died down. I wanted to smoke while drinking or after a good meal but recognize and resist those triggered urges and eventually you'll get past it. "
"Quit cold turkey, mostly because the prices for a pack were slowly raised to retarded levels where I used to live."
"I used the patch for the first few days (to help get over the worst part of it), and then went cold turkey.
I chewed sunflower seeds every time I got in my car and always kept Lifesaver mints in my purse to suck on when I got the urge to smoke."
"I smoked for 20 years or so. I got the opportunity to move countries and decided after I get on the plane, I will never buy another box. I put my last cigarette out before boarding and never lit up again. I do not even know what smokes cost here. After many attempts, it took getting completely out of my routine and starting something new to stay the course. I quit 6 years ago."
A loved one getting angina is a pretty big one.....but i wouldn't recommend having any of your loved ones getting that just to entice you to quit. :p
"One day I realized the ridiculousness of the habit... Why am I paying so much money to slowly poison myself to death? I don't need this to survive so why am I paying for it? After 15 years I quit smoking cold turkey and never had a craving and never looked back.
I guess being a cheap bastard worked out for me that time."
"My daughter cried and told me she didn't want me to die. It made me give up straight away. I got on the patches, they worked great, never looked back. "
"Seeing a long time smoker cough up blood, then light up. "
I just stopped.
After I got out of the military I had to move in with my dad for a bit. He told me if he ever caught me smoking he would kill me. He showed me the gun. Cold turkey it was and I'll be damned if it didn't work! Thanks dad! 
"Not quitting quitting. As far as the cold turkey/NRT debate, I used nicotine gum and chewed it for at least a year after my last cigarette. I went from 2.5 packs (or the equivalent with rollies) to the full strength gum to the light gum at the point I was meant to quit gum. For a year or two after the gum, I'd occasionally get a nic fit, but I had distanced myself from cigarettes so much, I'd crave the gum.  
I am now almost six years after my last cigarette, and I never get nic fits. I hate smoke. I don't mind it if people smoke outside, away from my window, but I hate the smell. Yes, I am one of those ex-smokers and I am so fucking glad I am. My father-in-law, a smoker for longer but a much lighter smoker (<a pack a day) quit a month or two before me and still craves a cigarette almost every day. Not saying either experience is typical with either method as it probably depends on the smoker, but this is my experience.
As far as quitting, once you get there, it's the most amazing feeling. It still amazes me that I am a non-smoker. From my first few packs, I was always a heavier smoker than those around me. By the time I was 18, I was smoking more than a pack and a half a day. It took me a few years of different methods and attempts to quit, but I know the biggest factor was just being determined to get to the point where I didn't smoke. Not to the point where I just smoked at parties or at the pub, but no smoking at all. "
"I smoked for 9 years. Decided to quit. Not because of health or money reasons. In fact i enjoyed smoking a lot. The reason I stopped was non smoking friends telling me how much it stunk. 
I believe anyone can stop smoking if they want. Just remember the whole battle takes place in the mind. I thought to myself on the very first day I quit "" The only way I will put another cigarette in my mouth is if somebody has a gun to my head "" .  Every time I had a bad craving I just though that. And after a week it was much easier. Its been 9 months now and the urge to smoke hasn't gone all together but when I get an urge I just remind myself that I'm in control. I've beat it and no matter what it will stay beat.
"
"Getting knocked up. Haha.
No really, I started with the electronic cigarettes to help get me through cravings. Then I tried nicotine gum but I found that I couldn't chew an entire piece as it would make me jittery and burn my mouth so I started chewing half pieces. 
For the first month or so, I avoided drinking (a craving trigger of mine even still) and avoided hanging out with or around smokers. This meant eating in the break room at work instead of going outside where all the smokers congregate. 
Also, I saved this picture http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z-qFD3X-xbE/UjTSJsocwaI/AAAAAAAAJfs/egSOt3prFuY/s1600/q.jpg to my phone and looked at it whenever I had a bad craving.
6 months later, I am still smoke free."
"Few (4-5) of my friends stopped smoking after reading one book (about 100pages long)
If anyone is interested I'll ask them for title."
"Electronic cigarettes.
I did everything else.  Cold turkey, patches, gum, so on.  Everything except for the pills (which I refused to touch after seeing what they did to my dad).
I saw Blu, several years ago, and started doing research.  The 510 had just came out, so I bit the bullet and bought a kit.  When it came in on a Saturday, I had bought a pack the night before.
It was the last pack of cigarettes I've purchased.
Edit: I just remembered there was a point that I bought a pack.  I had stopped using my 510/mods at that point, and my dad's 'easy, 2 day recovery' surgery turned into 'fuck, he almost died', which then had almost a year of insanity related to that surgery .  I had no working batteries, no working chargers, etc., and bought a pack.  Then went back to vaping as soon as I could get a replacement to my door.  So when I bought my 510, the night before was the *second* to last pack."
"Willpower (should that be 2 words?).  Really, nothing worked until I just decided I wasn't going to smoke anymore.  That was 10 years ago and I smoked for 20.  After the first week you've basically kicked the physical addiction which doesn't mean it's easy but you no longer need the cigs you just want them."
"I moved to USA, where cigs cost U$12 while at my hometown they used to cost the equivalent to U$2"
"You really have to want to quit otherwise it will never happen.  Once you have made that decision it depends on your will power.  I am weak in that department so I tried eCigs this time around.  It really helps for the action of smoking that is the hard habit for me.  The nicotine withdrawal is manageable but the hand to mouth habit is really tough.
I started with a higher dose of nicotine in my ecig and each time i order more juice, i drop it down a level.   So far so good, 6 months in!"
I never drank coffee before so I traded cigarettes with coffee. I've been smoke free for a year and four months. 
Cold turkey after spending some time on whyquit.org.  It's been 3 years after smoking for about 24
I hear going to a sauna to sweat out the nicotine helps. You need to go there like two days in a row or something.
Quit cold turkey when I found out I was pregnant. 
My girlfriend dumped me. She hated that I smoked so to spite her I quit cold turkey. Its been over six years since I had a cigarette. 
"For me it was persistent bronchitis. I got so sick of feeling like hammered shit, I just threw my last pack away and that was that.
I've had a couple of isolated ones since but never started again."
"I started by only smoking 3 times a day, the important smokes was after meals, and taking a shit smokes (smokers know wassup). And I stayed high off of some good weed most of the day, when I was high and cotton mouth cigarette smoke taste was nasty to me. 3 cigs a day and when I could I smoked weed to get me off cigs. Eventually cut those 3 a day to 2, then 1....then before I knew it."
"Cold turkey and sunflower seeds (in shell).  I'm not going to blow smoke up your ass--I was a miserable bastard, and I'm sure I made a few people around me miserable as well.  After a month, though, I was pretty well good to go."
"i think the thing for me was realizing and being okay with the fact that i am never going to have another cigarette again. once you accept that, just adhere to it. just stop, that's it. "
Sounds dumb but Allen Carrs Easy Way to quit smoking. Never read the book but a friend sent me a bootleg of the web seminar. Sat through all 4 hours and never looked back. Went from white knuckle discipline quitting to just being totally over it after 15 years of heavy smoking. Can't recommend highly enough. Seen it work for some serious lost causes. 
"Cold turkey is the only way. Don't bother yourself with excuses. Remove yourself from the environment for 2 weeks, and you'll be in the clear. Good luck."
"for me, it was realizing that those stressed feelings - moments of panic - cravings for a cigarette etc - cigarettes don't help those feelings, they CAUSE them.  and it means that when you're in the worst part of a craving,  the best way out is through.
make that your mantra -  The best way out is always through.
also - no substitutes.  gum, nicotine patches, e-cigarettes.  none of it.  cold turkey."
"I smoked for 12 years, and when I quit it was just cold-turkey. I know that many people can't do this, but it worked for me.
Almost 10 years free of it now."
Actually wanting to quit coupled with Chantix.
"I smoked a pack a day for about ten years, and was working my way up to about a pack and a half a day. I'd tried the gum twice, the patch twice, and Welbutrin once without success. I finally broke down and got an e-cig and just stuck with that for six months, hitting it as frequently as I'd light a cigarette, without cheating and having any real cigarettes. After those six months I quit that thing cold turkey.
     I also took up the sport of fencing to reward myself and reenforce my decision to stop smoking."
"I went to a local MMA gym in town looking to do something with my life and not be a piece of shit anymore. The gym I went to took people with any level of experience and they preached ""You can do it, but you have to put the time in."" I really dedicated myself to it. The workouts were so intense and I absolutely hated, but I started gaining confidence everyday as well as learning self respect. I took it very seriously and I realized smoking was severely inhibiting my ability to perform my new hobby. I quit cold turkey 4 years ago because I dedicated myself to a new lifestyle and never looked back. Cheers."
Just not smoking anymore seems to do the trick
I substituted it with snus. Worked for me :)
[This](http://youtu.be/0TL2Vh7goJc) video helped me tremendously.
"I met my now girlfriend that basically took me away from my friends and away from the neighborhood that would encourage smoking. 
You see, I would go to my friend's house and jam out and smoke all weekend. We knew a lot of people around the neighborhood so they would come by and smoke in the garage. 
Since when my girlfriend and I made it official, I ultimately stopped going over and that's when I quit meth cold turkey. "
"I also quit cold turkey (mostly). I had some old nicotine gum lying around that I chomped on a few times but that's it. I didn't change any routines really...I still drink coffee and alcohol which are two things that really draw me to smoking. I just forced myself to get used to drinking without smoking. Having regular old minty gum around also helped me. 
The impetus to quit came from a couple things. First and foremost was the cost. At about $7.50 a pack, it's just too much money to throw away. I really like smoking, but the obvious negative health benefits also forced me to quit. I got tired of clearing my lungs left and right, and after having sinus surgery and a tonsillectomy, I can finally truly enjoy the benefits of normal breathing. 
I used this kind of chart to track my ""progress"": http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html
Knowing that my body is fixing itself after years of smoking kept me motivated. The other thing I really liked is that at the end of the day, I still smell like I took a shower, rather than an ash tray.
"
"Chantix helped with the actual quitting. Made me smoke less and less, and not even want them. In fact, by the time I quit, they were disgusting to me. This was just in 1 week. Then for the next couple months while I still took it I wanted none. Once you're done with it, just like any quit smoker, you still have that want occasionally. Maybe while driving, or partying, or watching a movie where someone lights up even, so staying quit is all on you and WANTING to stay quit. Hands down, Chantix was the best at breaking the chemical side of the addiction, but for the psychological side it's all on you no matter what way you quit. Obviously, this is only great if you're not one of the ones that it makes hallucinate, go crazy, and try to kill yourself. Thankfully I had zero side effects."
"e-cig worked for me and I was smoking 1 to 1/12 packs a day for about 10 years. what kind of e-cig you have can make a world of difference, as well as the juice. Right now I'm vaping out of a Vamo V5 with a Kanger Pro-tank 3 and some honey pearry juice from the vapor chef. I got the equipment for about 90 bucks but it's the best vaping setup I've had so far. I ""quite"" smoking in the beginning of last August, with the occasional cig. the last time I had one, about a month ago it made me sick and tasted awful. So IMO do a bit more research in vaping. When I started I was at 18mg of nicotine and now I'm down to 12mg with a spare tank that has 6mg. Been trying to use the 6mg more so I can continue to decrease to 0mg. "
"My girlfriend help me quit 3 years ago. I slip every here and then when i'm drinking, but when i wake up theres no urge to smoke. In the beginning i knew my temptation was intense when i drank so i quit that for a while too. Its just your attitute towards quitting that works. Quiting cold turkey is the way I did it. Eating lots of gum and sunflower seeds helps too."
"""Madness is repeating the same thing over expecting different results."" Keep trying to quit, you have obviously failed a few times (no worries, we all have). If your sane (which I am assuming you are) you will eventually stop. Otherwise, well, at least you are in the right profession. "
"I smoked a lot of weed with my cigarettes and when I switched to vaping, I smoked less often. After one really hungover day where I couldn't even get out of bed for a stoge, I decided the next day that if I could go one day without a smoke, I could go two days, and so on. I also found myself getting stoned more often after quitting, but it leveled off in the end"
Determination. And just realizing how much my 20+ years of smoking have fucked up my health. I celebrated 3 years last week.
I got my wisdom teeth pulled out. 3 weeks later I realized I hadn't smoked and just stick with it. It's been 4 years and I don't crave it unless I've been drinking. I do admit that I've smoked one on occasion but never started up again. 
"I quit while I had a bad cold, which made the first three days go by easily. I never could smoke while I had a cold. Then, I quit drinking coffee and beer for two weeks, and going out to bars for the next month or so. I started drinking tea and taking tea breaks instead of smoke breaks. I smoked for 15 years, and I've been off of them for over four years now. Good luck!"
"I was really sick in the hospital for two weeks and they didn't allow smoking in the room, was really expensive but it worked. (Would not recommend this method) Still had cravings for two years whenever I smelled the refreshing aroma of tobacco."
"Pot.
Smoked pot a lot
Worked"
I smoked while wearing the patch. Getting nauseous/sick when I smoked did the trick. 
"I quit when a pretty girl said she'd make out with me if I went 2 weeks without a cigarette. I'm at 7 years, 2 months, 17 days... and still waiting for her to make out with me."
Cold turkey by far and actually really wanting to quit. 
Start Vaping. Ecigs are great and satisfy your oral fixation. You can still step out with your co-workers and even vape at your desk for the most part depending on your workplace. Everyone in my department quit smoking in the last 6 months thanks to vaping. I rarely even pull out my ecig anymore unless i'm ultra stressed. 
"Love, actually. "
Recognising all the triggers that made me want to smoke and either avoiding them or having strategies to deal with them. It took me a dozen tries but I'm at 6 months now and I've got no compulsion to start again.
"Fear.
I smoked for 6 months and would wake up hacking up black shit from my throat (newports) just quit it right then.
Wake up every morning to black phelm wasn't my idea of a good habit."
"I quit cold Turkey.  I had a mantra when I was feeling weak and craving a smoke, which was ""stop being a pussy"".  It was my way of mind over matter.  Feel like a cigarette after a meal?  Stop being a pussy!  Stressed at work and need a smoke?  Stop being a pussy!  I don't know, it worked for me.
I am 7 years without a cigarette."
I quit smoking via coma. (Not recommended)
just smoked a joint instead
"I used to smoke a pack a day. I quit using e-cigarrettes.
The trick with e-cigs is the following:
1. Get the e-liquid with the highest nicotine content (24+ mg)
2. **Don't quit smoking,** instead, 2-3 minutes before smoking, use the e-cig, that way when you do smoke, your body will already have nicotine, and the real cigarrette will not be as good.
3. After a few days of doing this 2 things will happen: YOu will stop associating Nicotine with Cigarettes, and the cigarrettes will start to taste bad, even to the point of making you nauseous. 
4. **Dont try to force quitting cigarrettes**, since after a while it will not be pleasant to smoke as long as you hit the e-cig beforehand.
5. Once you have a month or 2 without smoking cigarrettes, start changing the e-liquid every month to another with lower nicotine content. In my case i went 24,18,12,0. 
The whole process took me about 4 months, but the great thing is that **it was not hard**. I didn't have the abstinence issues because it was gradual and I never had to deal with being all anxious for a cigarette.
"
"For me Wellbutrin really took the edge off the craving while I tapered down.  I tapered pretty quickly (4 weeks?) and only took the drugs for another 4-6 weeks after that.
This was after several stints of patches (didn't work) and cold turkey (too hard).  Been 8 years now."
I dropped extacy one night and me and 2 others killed a carton of Newports in a 8 hr period.  They next day I felt like complete shit and have not touched a cig since.  
"I started with the patch then switched to the gum and lozenges.  Haven't had a cigarette in 3 years.  (Of course, now I need to try to quit the gum and lozenges because I'm still hooked on the nicotine.  But at least I can breathe and I don't smell like smoke.)"
"I used ""e-cigs"". I started with a cheap gas station model and quickly moved up to a high end Mod and RBA Dripper. 
Over the course of three months I slowly dropped my nicotine levels down to zero and I have been at Zero nicotine for 2 months now.
I now continue to vape because it became a hobby and something to keep myself busy when I get frustrated. Being a recovering alcoholic as well this has been a life saver for me more than just when it comes to tobacco."
"Willpower... Tons and tons of willpower!
It was my father dying that gave me the push so, as has been stated, with the right reasons its easy."
"Out of curiosity, which type of electronic cigarette are you using? I live in a family of smokers, and my brother had tried using vaporizers that look similar to actual cigarettes (like those you would find at a convenience store). He said it was ""alright"" but didn't give him that feeling in his throat that a normal cigarette did.
So I did a bit of research and got him a Kanger EVOD starter kit from a local vape shop. He loves it, and hasn't even thought about smoking a tobacco cigarette in almost a year.
I'd totally recommend heading over to /r/electronic_cigarette and checking out some of their resources. It's a wonderful way to start cutting back."
"Ex-smoker - 3 packs a day for 20 years.   Quit 12 years ago.  I took a day to myself and spent it on a treadmill.   I'd wear myself out, rest awhile and when I wanted a cigarette I'd get back on the treadmill.   ALL  day  long. 
When I made it through that day without cigs it was such an accomplishment that I could not let myself pick another one up.  Another trick:  pretend you are smoking and go through the motions, sucking air in and blowing it out routinely through the day.  I think I was more of a ""habitual"" smoker than an ""addicted"" one....I loved the whole process of opening the pack, pulling one out, lighting up, etc.   The physical part of withdrawal wasn't horrible for me even at 3 packs a day.  Three packs means you have a lit one in your hand at all times.   Ugh!  One last thought - you HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT. "
"I agree with quitting cold turkey. I replaced smoking with another vice,  video games. Video games with were such a great distraction from cigarettes and if my mood went foul from nicotine withdrawal, I could vent my frustrations at the screen and not hurt anyone. Heck, if you play LoL or COD people probably won't even notice. "
[deleted]
"I stopped smoking one day.  That's how i quit.  Take slow deep breaths if you get the urge, and remember that taking the easy way out, and caving in is foolish.    
Just take an e-cig with you if you think you can't control yourself. "
"It's okay if the first time doesn't take. Each time you quit the odds increase that you will stay quit. It took about four times for me. Also, the anticipation of quitting is far worse than actually quitting."
"For me, someone who tried quitting many times to varying degrees of success (but then again not, because I always ended up smoking again), what finally ended up working was a moderate dose of the patch and really just determination.
You need to want it, plain and simple. You need to realize how bad it is for you, and how stupid it is to throw so much money at a shitty unhealthy version of yourself. 
I decided I really wanted it, used Step-1 of the patch for 2 weeks before I started to forget to put it on, at which point I decided I didn't need it anymore and just went on cold turkey.
I used the patch occasionally after that when drinking with friends, but now I just buy Colts, or Captain blacks (cigarellos with plastic filters). I find the plastic filter is important because smoking them that way is really nothing like smoking a cig.
It will be a year for me March 1."
Zyban worked for me. It made cigarettes not enjoyable.
"I switched to e-cigs and it's been brilliant. My problem was always that in addition to being hooked on nicotine I really enjoyed the flavour and smell of tobacco. Patches etc were great for the cravings but it's hard to give up something that you genuinely enjoy. 
So I switched over to one of these: http://www.vipelectroniccigarette.co.uk/photon-express-kit-p-235.html
And it's honestly great because in addition to the nicotine it's got a lovely flavour and you have a great deal of control over how strong it is. Not to mention that buying the refil liquid is easily less than buying cigarettes!"
"25 M here. Smoked a pack a day for 7 years. Then quit cold turkey. Allen Carr, ""the easy way to stop smoking"" 
Worked for me and I believe if i can stop smoking ....."
Currently on 2months of no smoking. So far push-ups have helped. I get a craving I do push-ups until I hate myself. Worked so far. 
"I had quit and restarted many times in my 20+ years of pack-a-day smoking. This last time had a major difference. I didn't like who I was anymore. I wanted to change and be the person I always imagined I should be; healthy, financially sound, a good father and emotionally optimistic. 
I already had a running list of those personal traits that I didn't like about myself. So I did the math and picked the one thing that would shift my course the most. Smoking won hands down. I had quit before but always came back so i looked at the mechanism of failure in the past. And it was right in front of me. I was ""quitting"" smoking. It is understood that the physical addiction to nicotine is not nearly as powerful as the habitual nature of smoking.
So I decided that I wouldn't quit smoking this time but instead would become a non-smoker. I would have to adopt new habits rather than just rely on abandoning existing ones. Quitting smoking is not about secession of an activity. It's about learning how to spend your time doing other things. Initially, the new thing that I was going to do was not smoke. I had to focus on ignoring a short term desire and keep my eyes toward my long term goal. Every time I jonesed, I would take a deep breath and tell myself that I never want to be a slave again. I want to breath deeply and for as many years as I could manage. I was desperate to succeed in this one way. 
And it worked. Quitting smoking is miserable. I didn't drink because I was terrified of failing. I avoided being around smokers for the same reason. I also said I would do whatever it took to not smoke. For me, eating was how I managed the cravings. I stuffed myself with comfort food until the endorphins kicked in. 30lbs later I was mostly over the insanely overwhelming desire to smoke. When the little joneses popped up, I would take a deep breath and realize I couldn't feel my lungs anymore. With the realization that I could breathe and smell again, I took up some exercise. Suddenly I wasn't a smoker who wanted to quit. I was a non smoker who wanted to be fit. 
Becoming a nonsmoker has been the single greatest gift I have ever given myself. I hope you will give yourself the same freedom. Remember, you are a slave. "
"I smoked for years and tried to quit I don't know how many times. The problem was I ENJOYED smoking. When I was finally successful it was after a night of partying. I felt like shit and decided that was it. I wasn't going to smoke or drink anymore. I was very serious and determined. I wanted to quit. And that first day of sobriety and no smoking .... guess where my husband wanted to go? (He still did both-but I did eventually nag him into quitting smoking 6 months later) My husband and I went to the casino (where people are allowed to smoke indoors.... and everywhere you look that's what people are doing.) I swear he was testing me. But I still did not give up, and every time I wanted a smoke, I thought to my self: ""I've come this far, I can get through this, I don't want to start at zero again!""
My triggers were drinking and work breaks, coffee in the morning, etc, etc.
 I quit drinking at the same time, because once you have had a couple drinks, there goes your willpower and you'll start smoking again. It's much easier to say yes to a cig after a few drinks. 
At work (I was a waitress at the time (so pretty much the same thing as you- no breaks for people unless they are taking a smoke). And for me, that wasn't the bad part. Keeping  busy is actually a good thing. When I did take my lunch break, I started doing crossword puzzles to keep myself occupied and not thinking about smoking.
Eventually I started drinking again (a few years later) but by then, I only drank occasionally and much less than before. In the almost 9 years that I've been smoke free, I've only had about 4-5 cigarettes (and only one each slip up)- and each time drinking was involved. 
Beware of your SO or someone else trying to sabotage you (mine did a couple times before I finally quit- I think because HE didn't want to quit smoking.
Even today, almost 9 years later, I still think about cigarettes from time to time, and I even dream about buying a pack and smoking them. I guess it's like any other kind of addict, once you are addicted, you are addicted for life. But the good news is that you can quit and be successful at it.
I quit cold turkey and that worked for me. My will power isn't that great, so if I had one, I would have another and another. It was easier for me to just say No More. And stick to that. My husband, on the other hand, needed to gradually taper off until it was just once a day, then he stopped completely. It took him a couple months to completely quit. 
TL/DR: You have to really WANT to quit. It's about stopping bad habits and replacing with good ones. Be careful of others not supporting you/ making it easy for you to smoke again. 
Last of all, I would suggest not using the electronic cigs. That just keeps the habit going, not to mention the addiction to nicotine. It's like trading regular ice cream for no-sugar-added ice cream. It's still bad for you."
"My brother had an aortic aneurysm, he (and I) have a heart defect known as a bi-cuspid valve. We both smoked at the time, he came extremely close to dying. As soon as I heard about it, my cravings disappeared... well for about 2 years, I now occasionally really want one.... Not much advice here I guess, but that is what worked for me. "
"My husband and I tried the e cigarettes. I personally don't feel like they are much better for you than cigarettes, but I guess it helped me. I stopped using my e cig almost three months ago, and I haven't even thought about touching a cigarettes my husband on the other hand still secretly smokes cigarettes, and pretends to not know what I'm talking about when I asked if he smoked a cigarette today. Lol so I suppose it just depends on your will power. 
"
"Not myself, as I've never smoked, but my dad.
He smoked from 16 until 32 (I think), then on Father's Day my Mum bought him a packet of cigarettes and he realised how much his life had revolved around cigarettes for so long. 
He made sure not to disrespect my mother, but threw that packet, and whatever he had that related to smoking, straight in the bin, and never looked back.
Was one of the happiest days of my life seeing him quit. He was out walking the dog every day, playing football with me, throwing frisbees around with me and my friends, and he used the money he saved to buy his first decent camera. He is now an excellent photographer, and lives a happy life. GG Dad."
"The first time I was able to quit for 6 months (the longest I've gone without tobacco) was through VAPING (electronic cigs). I started off with juices that had 15mg nicotine and I worked my way down eventually to 0mg nicotine over the course of a couple weeks. Probably the best way to quit, although juices can be expensive."
A quitting buddy and complete abstinence from nicotine. Being able to talk to someone till the cravings go away really helped. P.S. they ALWAYS do go away! 
Even now after 5 years I still get cravings.  Its easier to blow them off now.
"Every time I wanted to smoke, right after I had the thought, I went to the kitchen and poured myself a glass of water. Not half a glass, not almost full, but full. Always.
Sometimes I just had a glass and on the way back to my room I had another thought about wanting to smoke, turned around and marched back to the kitchen for another full glass.
Quickly I grew tired of so much water and having to stand up to go to the kitchen. I was so full that my mind didn't want to think about smoking, because it hurt.
So I changed a bad habit for a good one."
"Honestly there is no magic cure for quitting. I decided just to stop in March and I've been doing great. Of course you get urges to smoke and sometimes they are really strong but they eventually pass. And oh my god just after a month of no smoking you can breath so much better and you almost don't cough for no reason. Now I also understand why people hate the smell of cigarette smoke, the second my stepdad lights a cigarette I smell it and it makes my stomach upset. 
I would really like one of those E-Cigs though because I think the only reason I smoked is because it gave me something to do for a while. "

"First off, I agree with a lot of the comments here that state something to the effect of ""more than anything, you gotta be ready to quit.""
That said, I don't agree with statements to the effect of ""in the end, only by willpower can you overcome your nicotine addiction."" As a person in recovery, I find that kind of thinking unproductive in any effort to achieve sobriety of any kind. Here's where that thinking leads (for me):
If one has willpower, one can quit.
I have been unable to quit.
I must not have willpower.
Since I don't have willpower, it's not worth it to even try quitting.
Anyone who relies or has relied on one addictive substance or another can tell you that thinking like that precedes a binge. The very definition of addiction is a behavior that cannot be curbed by willpower alone. Admitting to oneself that ""I can't do it without help"" is an essential element in most addicts' recovery plans.
My advice to OP is to get on a patch, gum or some other nicotine replacement therapy to remove the chemical craving and then develop strategies to treat the psychological craving. Patch didn't work for you before? Try again. It's your health on the line.
Or try a new strategy, like going to an AA meeting. Not an alcoholic? Go anyway. Find an open meeting in your area. No one there will make you speak. Just listen. Those meetings are filled with people talking about what to do when willpower is not enough. The lessons are transferable to any addictive behavior. Also visit www.smartrecovery.org for a more science/research-based approach to quitting/recovery.
Nicotine addiction doesn't make you drive dangerously or fight people or piss away the rent or perform sex acts for a fix, but that doesn't change one bit the fact that it's a serious substance-dependency issue. Treat it like one.

"Lung Cancer. Well, a scare of Cancer. 
I smoked for 17 years. Quit a few times on and off. The standard smokers mantra. 
Was having some chest pains for a few days. Went to see the Doc. Sent for xrays, found 'spots'. 
I panic. I'm a single parent with two kids. I quit that day. 
Get biopsy done. No cancer just damage from years of smoking and welding. 
I'm still not smoking, also not welding and now run Marathons.
It is not easy but it does get easier. You just need to remind your brain your in charge!
Best of luck."
"When I was ready to quit smoking, I kept half a pack hidden away and used nicotine gum. Knowing that the cigarettes were there was comforting and a big motivational tool for me to just leave them alone. After I was smoke free for a month, I gave them away. "
"i systematically cut down till i was at 3 or 4 cigs a day, then quit cold turkey. it was a miserable few days but i got over it. for awhile, i'd go outside and just spend ten minutes on reddit to fill the void. 
my husband waited till our 10 day vacation at disney world to quit because smoking there is difficult to do, mostly hidden out of sight so you forget about it, and there's plenty of distractions and junk to eat so you can be too busy to really dwell on it. after ten days, the physical symptoms were well over with and it's just a matter of mentally coping. "
"Found other addictions?
Before quitting I had pretty bad strep throat for about a week. It hurt to do anything. I had to take pain meds and wait for them to kick in just so I could try to get some food down and sleep for a few hours before they wore off.
Smoking just hurt too bad and I was in too much pain to really notice the nicotine urges.
After I was able to eat/drink again, I figured that the hard part for quitting smoking was over (that initial week) so I said fuck it and stopped. 
Problem was, when I stopped my sinuses went fucking nuts. It looked like I got punched on either side of my nose there was so much swelling. They ended up putting me on Prednisone to get the swelling down. However, after that I had a really touch time breathing through my nose so, not knowing any better, I started using Afrin and it worked amazingly well.
A year later I finally gave that up and just deal with the withdrawal of it (SOOOOOO much worse than the nicotine). Due to not being able to breath right through my nose anymore, I started getting bad anxiety. So one day, in order to try to take my mind off of it, I grabbed a bag of sunflower seed and just started cracking and spitting them for hours at a time.
I ended up having surgery a few years later to try and correct the issues with my nose. It helped a little.
So now I have a crazy thing for sunflower seeds........
TL;DR - Get sick or find a new addiction"
"For my father it was a lung cancer scare. Nothing like a shadow in a x-ray to give you that extra boost of willpower. Luckily it turned out to be something benign, in more than one way."

"I tried cold turkey and that obviously didn't work.. So I tried tapering off, and that failed as well. Then I tried the gum, which was so awful that I couldn't bring myself to chew it. The patch finally did it for me. I had some bizarre dreams while using the patch, but I had zero urge to smoke, and it was easy to remember to change it out and then not think about it for a while."
"I'll tell you how my mom quit after smoking for 50 years.
She got a bad chest cold to the point where smoking hurt more than it was worth. The cold lasted 2 weeks and she was forced to not smoke for the duration. Coming out on the other side she had quit cold turkey and has been clean for years now."
"Go sprint outside for as long as you can when you want to smoke. I mean, hard sprint so you are out of breath. Clears the craving. Don't use gum or patches. "
"Twenty three years smoking here.
Two years ago I started walking/running and it was affecting me so I just took my last puff out of the last marlboro red I had and quit.

"I know everyone is saying that cold turkey is the best way to go, but having quit using Chantix, I have to say it is extremely effective.  My mother quit with it first, and I was skeptical but she swore by it.  So I tried it a few months later.  They say to smoke for the first week while taking the drug.  I smoked for the first three days.  I didn't plan it that way but on the fourth day I just didn't want to smoke anymore.  I cant describe how well it worked.  The only real downside was the side effects.  Mostly crazy vivid dreams and mild nausea.  I would definately reccomend talking to a doctor about Chantix if you haven't been successful on your own."
"Smoked for 15 or so years, been using electronic one for 2 years now.
Tried patches, gum and all kind of other nonsense before this, but none of them worked.
Guess I really lacked the will to quit, but I find using the e-cig a suitable substitute.
Sure, being able to quit completely would be optimal."

Lots of videos on youtube about how to get the best out of this kit. Search for ""Protank"" and look for Pbusardo (basic maintenance and simple coil builds) and Rip Trippers (more complex coils).
You can buy replacement heads but if you're needing more vapour building your own can be better (takes about an hour to make enough for a year, once you know how to do it, and costs pennies per head).
That battery makes building really easy because it will test the resistance of the coil for you.
Best of luck. Get a decent ecig, seriously. I failed on the others so many times, this one cured me instantly."
"Ecigs, not the gas station kind but the vaporizer kind. Made it so much easier and almost seamless"
E-Cig did it for me.  Done day 1!!
"I combined quitting with getting a cold. Dealing with withdrawal on its own is tough, but if you mix it with already feeling like crap, it's pretty tough to tell the difference! I three-days smoke-free before I even realized it.
So, I just I made a conscious decisions to not smoke -- this after smoking a pack a day for ~15 years. Seven days smoke-free and counting!"
"Switch to vapor or e-cigs. Find a good one that you enjoy the taste, has heavy smoke & hits the back of your throat and gradually mix it in. Vaping is fast becoming the most popular way to give up. You still get the nicotine, but non of the nasty carcinogens or smell, or tar, or ash...and you can reduce the amount until you're just vaping for fun. 
It's the only thing that helped me. "
"Not really a good technique because it just happened but I got such a bad chest/sinus cold I could barely breathe. I attempted to smoke a cigarette because I wanted one sooo bad, it made me cough harder than anything in the world, my eyes were blood shot and I couldn't catch my breath. Freaked me out so bad I cold turkied it from that day on. "
"The first thing, like any addiction is knowing that you need to and actually wanting to quit.  I smoked for 20 years and quit just recently (second time I have actually tried).  Last time, I took Chantix and it worked well.  What didn't work well was saying that it was ok for me to continue to smoke cigars on the weekends.  A couple of drunk weekends six months down the road led me back into cigs.  This time, nothing at all will be smoked.
My friend is quitting also right now and is having a hard time in life.  He is using that as an excuse, and I don't blame him, but anyone can find an excuse.  The hardest part is telling yourself that it is just an excuse and that smoking doesn't fix anything, ever."
Plain and simple. You have to actually want to.
I would feel like a real asshole if I got cancer and had to burden my family because of smoking. Something I inflicted on myself. 
"My mom & sister got hypnotized. It was covered under health care and free, and it worked for both of them. They haven't smoked in 3 years!
My other sister got hypnotized too, but it didn't work on her, and she does still smoke, so I guess it doesn't work for everyone."
"No money and my girlfriend out of town I had no way of getting them.  I begged whoever I could find,  smoked my old butts, but in the end a week went by and i just didn't need them anymore. "
"The patch. It is a six week process, and it worked for me both times I quit. I left it on 24/7 to avoid morning cravings and got some bonus lucid dreams. Sunflower seeds and lots of chewing gum helped to deal with the oral fixation. It totally works to get you over the chemical addiction and break the habit. I haven't smoked in three years. "
"My kids. I was a smoker for over 22 years with small stages of being quit and once again had promised my kids that after New Year's Eve, I would put them down forever. That did  not happen of course and about midway through January 2012 my 12 year old daughter and 7 year old son sat me down for a talk. They explained to me that they understood now that it was okay to lie to the people you love so long as you are enjoying whatever it is you are lieing about. Kids are too smart for me. I put the cigarettes down and have not touched one since."
"Chantix. You have to start taking it while you're smoking. Once it starts taking effect after a week or two you will stop getting a buzz when you have that first smoke in the morning. (they say to quit one week after taking chantix, It took me 3 or 4 weeks before I finally started to put them down) You may continue to smoke until you think you are ready. Once you say, ok, I'm ready to quit now.. you may do ok for a while.. but then you may slip up and have one because you are out having a drink with friends or something. You smoke that cigarette, but get no buzz, no satisfaction out of it. If you had quit cold turkey, that one cigarette would have set you back, but if you're taking chantix, it blocks the nicotine receptors in your brain, so the addiction cycle has not been restarted.
It basically makes you go through the physical withdrawls from the nicotene while you're still smoking.. giving you time to work out the mental part on your own."
"It's been 300 days since I last quit. I used to smoke up to 6 cigarettes a day on average. 
What worked for me:First off, I never realised that that I would actually crave for cigarettes. But, slowly one or two months before I actually quit, I was unable to stomach the fact that I was inhaling a burning paper filled with random dried herbs directly pushing a burning crop into my lungs. It started off with a feeling like cooties for a injection, I slowly could no longer get myself to inhale it. Like how one would ""shudder"" or ""dread"" the pinch of the injection as a kid, I could no longer inhale burning smoke directly into my lungs with ease.
This slowly evolved into such a big dread that I finally stopped one  day. Cold turkeyed myself and told myself you are going to avoid that shit however long you can. 
At first, for like 2-3months it was ""however long I can hold out"". Using the factors mentioned below I led my life as a non-smoker. What I did not realise is, once I had those factors mastered, I was no longer going to ""hold out however long I want"", after 6 months I had quit. I was only going to ""begin smoking again"" if I went back to it. I remain in this state and am proud. I now offer helpful advice and occasionally request my friends to quit smoking.
Factors that helped me stay off smoking again:
1. I did a 30minute youtube self hypnosis to not smoke. I have no proof that actually worked, but I have never smoked after doing that.
2. Self-restraint: I started craving for a smoke the morning of any exam or important day. Drank coffee, and had a banana instead.
3. Say 'no' to friends and people who offer you / ask you if you'd like to smoke. This goes A LONG WAY. LEARN TO SAY NO. You only ever have to say it once or maximum twice to a person and they will not bother you. 
4. Stay indoors and involve yourself in immersive habits and work.
5. You CAN STILL bond over cigarettes, you no longer need to smoke to bond over cigarettes. Example: you meet a new person who asks if you want to go for a smoke outside, instead of being a snob and saying ""no I'll just stay here"" or something you can just go, stand and talk while the other person smokes. However, you must avoid this if you believe it will cause you to cave in.
Wrapping up, it's always within you. It's not hard once you have the willpower and self-confidence.
Good Luck."
"Just get pissed off at ciggerettes for ruling your life.  Exsmoker 5years now.
I tried all the quitting stuff including ecigs don't waste your money,just get pissed as hell.
(25 year smoker)"
"It's very very simple. Don't pick up a cig. Just don't. ""Oh but it's hard."" Then you don't want to quit too bad. 
I smoked a pack a day for like 7 years and quit by refusing to pick up a smoke. Tough yes but very simple. "
"I started dating a non-smoker. Even though he wouldn't get angry with me when I came home smelling like a cigarette, I knew he could tell and it wasn't a smell he would ideally like to put his mouth on. Eventually I just decided I was tired of de-cigging my scent for him, and I stopped. I also did it for myself, but it was so easy to do it with someone else you care about in mind. "
"The decision to be a parent.  When we came to the conclusion that we were as ready to be parents as we would ever be, I tossed my last pack in the trash can and we were expecting two weeks later.  Of course, I didn't know that part for another four weeks.  Haven't slipped once."
"I'd tried over the years, but I guess I just didn't want to quit bad enough. A little over a year and a half ago, I had just come in from a smoke break. at work, and was like ""I want to quit."" I still had half a carton of cigarettes at home and a whole pack in my possession. I had just had enough of it. Told my co-workers, and aside from the first weekend REALLY messing with my anxiety issues, I have not looked back at all. I've been to bars, clubs, and other places where I've been tempted in the past, and the smell just nauseates me now. I did it cold turkey -- didn't even use suckers like I had in the past for the oral fixation (which was my biggest downfall before). I guess it was just time for me.
But really, you just gotta be ready and actually want it. Not for someone else, not because people say it's bad for you, but because YOU want to quit. And like /u/kirkirus said, the first few days of withdrawal are kind of hell, so I would be somewhere you're not going to ruin friendships/work relationships. I had massive anxiety issues before I quit, and the withdrawal made them worse for those three days. 
After the first week, any time I would get a craving, I'd ask myself, ""Do I really want to start ALL over again?"" The answer was always HELL NO, because that first week sucked a lot. I did NOT wanna go through that again."
"First, you have to really want to quit. I don't mean oh I should probably quit blah blah blah. I mean you really have to want it. I tried a few times and failed. Deep down I knew I didn't want to stop. I enjoyed smoking. Then one night my husband and I were home relaxing after an evening out and could smell the smoke on us and were disgusted. We decided that we were done and haven't smoked since. We both smoked for at least 10 years and quit cold turkey. February will be 2 years! We stayed away from bars for a few weeks and asked our friends to support us. I skipped the smoke breaks with co-workers and stayed inside for a few weeks. I am not part of that ""group"" anymore, but now us non-smokers have made our own ""smoke break group"" and take breaks in our break room or go for short walks around the building. My husbands trick that he swears by was drinking SanPellegrino. Really anything citrus helps cut the cravings. I think the key was truly wanting to quit this time. We didn't pick a date or say we are going to finish this last pack. I don't even remember how many we had left in the pack. We just stopped. Sure there were headaches and moodiness at first. Just warn everyone around you and ask for their patience and support. Also, don't replace one bad habit with another.
"
The thing that worked for me and my friends was working out and or girl friends. Real shit kiddies 
"I know three months isn't very long, but it's still been a great feeling. "
"This may seem silly, but I really just lost interest in smoking. Granted, I had only smoked for a couple of years, and never more than half a pack of day. At some point, I just got bored of it. Which is especially strange because I have a very addictive personality - I've gone through a couple of drug addictions in the past, and they have been difficult to overcome. But cigarettes not so much."
I'm with you there. I realized they were causing stress not removing it. Plus they make you feel shittey.
"First, I decided never to buy a pack of cigarettes again. I forced my self to roll my own. I started with the better rolling tobacco (Bali Shag) and worked down to the shitty rolling tobacco (Top, Bugler). I still needed that nicotine fix but the cigarettes were so eye-wateringly strong and gross I started to kind of hate them. Secondly, I scheduled a strict regimen of when I'd get my ""dose""-- One cigarette after each meal, solely, which was 3 a day. If I missed one, tough shit, have to wait until the next dose. I stopped putting tobacco in my spliffs, and made a rule that I would smoke absolutely NO blunts. After a year of 3 cigarettes a day, I decided I would cut it down to ONE cigarette a day, after dinner. After six months of that, it's sort of like ""if I'm only smoking one, why even bother?"" and I quit, fully and wholeheartedly. After 4 weeks the cravings were completely gone. I quit five and a half years ago, and while I have tried to take drags off cigarettes occasionally, I can't even finish a cigarette without vomiting now. "

"It was a requirement for dating my now wife. 
You need to layer your nicotine. Use the patch AND gum. Or patch and e-cig. After a week or two you can go off the patch. This worked fairly well for me, but I did continue to use the gum for 1-2 years. "
"in Belgium there a medicine that's called champix, it's expensive but it works"
"Dip, especially snus, is helping me cut down. I tried cold turkey, but anything shaped like a cig would get chewed up to hell, especially pens, which had burst in my mouth a few times. I just quit drinking and cutting, and I've been on a diet, and been working thru an anxiety and agoraphobia, so I decided cold turkey wasn't my best move. I use dip pouches, cleaner and more enjoyable, either camel snus or skoal, mint flavoured on both. It gives the oral fixation rest, and has nicotine. I've cut back to a pipe, no inhaling, and one cigarette a week. "
"i really wish i had a pearl or nugget of wisdom, to be honest, i got an upper respiratory infection and didn't crave one. i kept saying, give it a couple of days and you can smoke. well after a week i kept saying, it's been a week why start back now? sorry, that's how i did it, hope it helps. good luck, it isn't easy. "
I post this same topic and get down voted. I was told I should should have searched since is been asked over and over again. 
"I decided it was time to man up and quit.  I had a newborn and her health was more important to me than cigarettes. I threw my last pack in the trash and never bought more. That was 13 years ago this week.
"
"I quit smoking when my lung collapsed. (spontaneous pneumothorax) 
Almost dying was all I really needed."
"My husband is coming up on a year of not smoking. For him, the key was to think: ""well, I want a cigarette. I could have one now (disappoint myself and everyone, spend that money) and I would still want one in an hour. So better not to have one now and want one in an hour. Because either way, that's happening.""
That philosophy plus Tootsie pops got him through."
"I quit cold turkey, but the motivation was when I went home to visit family, and my younger siblings were complaining that I smelled weird. "
Chantix. Sure did. Was just on it a month and haven't smoked in 9 years and have zero desire to ever smoke again.
"I went on a 10 mile hike up a mountain with some friends.
The last mile and a half was like walking up steep stairs.
Had been in shape most of my life, but it absolutely thrashed my legs.
I was so sick of how out of shape I was and could barely walk the next couple of days.
The pain and the self loathing overcame the withdrawals and I quit cold turkey during that time."
"17 years at a pack a day habit for me; I quit on August 19th, 2013.  I went cold turkey with the help of a Naturopath.  She helped me in a few ways; talked to me about strategies, desired results, talked about symptoms, and gave me some things to help with some of the non-withdrawl related, physical symptoms associated with quitting (constipation, restless legs, difficulty sleeping).
I tried to quit about 5 times in the past; tried the patch/gum/substitute method, Alan Carr's book, cold turkey, gradual reduction, and none of them stuck.  I really feel that having someone to help draw out and verbalize your goals is helpful; I felt much more responsible to the task, to myself, and to her as a partner in my quitting. 
If I can recommend one thing, it's to get someone on your side who you will feel responsible to and who will help you through.  Plan your quit with them and keep them involved.  It was absolutely invaluable for me."
"Buy a bicycle, and start riding it as frequently as possible, just for the hell of it. Take it to work and ride for 15 minutes instead of sitting around during your break, take a spin around the neighborhood at dusk, find a remote road somewhere, bike paths, a park with paved sidewalks, any where you can get your heart/breathing rate up for just a few minutes. (Surprisingly, riding for a few minutes will actually give you MORE energy!) As your cardiovascular health improves cigarettes will start to taste REALLY bad. It will still be hard to quit, it's not like you won't have cravings, but cigarettes will become naturally aversive given that your lungs will be healing/recovering. That's how I quit..."
I got pregnant.
"Several things worked for me. One thing that helped me was to fail after going without cigarettes for a year. When I went back to smoking I felt disappointed and defeated. So when I made my mind up the second time around I decided that my mind was going to be stronger than my desire. Being determined to overcome it is key. Then I held onto other peoples advice.
Advice #1: The craving only lasts about ten minutes
Advice #2: Not ""one day at a time"", but ""one craving at a time""
Advice #3: You cannot just smoke one
Advice #4: If you do smoke just one then the ""I quit"" clock starts all over again
And if you still feel ""too weak"" then add Chantix to the mix!!! Several people I know were successful using Chantix. Others quit with electronic cigarettes. Too me that is just trying to find a healthier way to continue feeding the addiction. By quitting completely you will appreciate the extra cash in your pocket too!!!
Just keep imagining that every time you refrain from smoking then you are helping your body to withdrawal the drug. You are letting the toxins go! Your mind and spirit are getting stronger every time you resist the temptation. By the time the first four days is over then you should realize that your body should have removed the majority of that junk out.
"
"Well even though it kinda has been said before quiting cold turkey is what worked for me, though I have to say I had some other tricks up my sleeve to.  
I smoked for 13 years and in that time I tried often to quit but never really managed more then a couple of months.  
Last time I quit, I realized what had gone wrong the other times. I tried to fight the habits that i connected to smoking,  
Waiting for the bus, let's smoke. I found a lot of things to do instead, read books when ever I wait for the bus, eat oranges whenever i need a break from work.  
But I think the most significant change in my life that helped me was that I found a new apartment, which i was moving to. I decided that my last day smoking was the last day in the previous apartment and since then I haven't smoked. 
 
"
"Time. Smoking took all my time. I could go iron a shirt for work or smoke a cigarette. When I finally realized I always went with the cigarette, I decided to take back my time and went cold turkey. 
Walking off them is not as hard physically as everybody says, you just need to get the mental crutch and you'll go. 
Use everything you can to prop yourself up. I read 10 pages of an Alan Carr book. I never smoked afterwards because I didn't want to ever have to read drivel like it again. 
Be prepared to gain some weight for a month or two while you adjust to your winning ways. Compromise on other things but not on your determination to take back your time and be the master of your own destiny."
"My grandpa just up and quit. One day he was chain smoking, put the next cig in his mouth and lit it, only to realize there was already an entire cigarette still burning in his mouth. At that point he decided he was done"
"I hated smoking, so quitting was easier. Quit smoking in certain places. Start at home. Never smoke at home. Then a liitle bit later, add the car, never smoke in the car, and etc. Last, add your work. By then you'll be smoking maybe three four cigarettes a day. Smoking is about habit. Break those habits one by one."
"My father went with hypnosis which worked for him.  I went cold turkey.  I should say I have gone back to smoking a few times.  I use logic and circumstance when I'm ready.  I once quit for 5 years because of a snowstorm, I didn't want to go outside and my cravings stopped after about 24 hours so I kept going.  I also get bronchitis every year or so and I have to not smoke, so that showed me I could do it.  Have a strong reason to keep saying no to smoking and I gained about 10 pounds or so in the weeks after."
"I smoked for 2 years and quit cigarettes cold turkey initially. When I would drink and REALLY crave a cig I would have nicotine gum and even did chewing tobacco a handful of times (disgusting I know).
It's been a little over a year since I've had a cigarette but I recently bought a high end e-cig online that I use specifically when I'm drunk. I never get the urge to smoke it when I'm sober.
Ecigs all the way people. Maybe not technically ""cold turkey"" but its 100000x better for you than actually smoking."
"Cold turkey.
One day I just looked at the pack, thought about how I was allowing some company to control not only my life, but how I'll exit life. Admittedly I was a 2edgy4me/adbusters sort of person at the time, but as ridiculous now as that angst was, that thought was disgusting enough to keep me going through all the times when I was craving. I threw the pack out the car window (I knew if I held onto it, I was going to smoke again) and didn't replace it.
I also set a date for myself. I had heard somewhere (don't know or really care if it's true or not) that 90 days is roughly what it takes to rid yourself of a habit. 90 days later I no longer craved it at all when I was around friends who smoked.
I guess I was a pretty good example. My parents ended up quitting just a few months after I did, neither of them smoke anymore either (aside from the occasional cigar). They both quit cold-turkey as well, but my dad ended up using Bupropion. He and I were rebuilding a pretty broken relationship at the time, and I was around a lot more than I used to be, so the fact that I wouldn't come outside to join him for a smoke might have helped, too."
"I forced myself to think of the cigarette as a delicacy rather than a requirement for me to get through the day. Like I'll have one a day and it will be a reward. Eventually I would get to that cigarette and the result wouldn't be as great as I thought in my head or I would forget about my ""reward"" altogether. This progressed until I didn't want one anymore at all, I grew out of them because I realized they weren't as great and stress-relieving as my mind convinced me they were. "
"I went to my dentist, and he gave me a prescription for this plastic thing that came apart. Inside of it you put a small nicotine pack and you closed it up. Then you could suck out of it, getting the nicotine you needed.
This was important because it fulfilled the need for the physical motion of smoking a cig.
Ive been going 7 years, and on 8 now without a smoke, I can hardly remember when I did smoke. It is great!"
"Cut out your triggers -- this probably means not hanging out with the same friends that you hang out with in the same way. If you generally sit around a bar with your amigos, change it up and invite them to do something that doesn't immediately make you think of smoking. 
Also, never, ever, ever walk into a convenience store. I never see this advice, but if you cut out your daily trip into the gas station, you won't be presented with the opportunity to buy cigs. 
"
"I had smoked for 8 years and was smoking Camel Wides for a couple of those years. One of my best friends and I decided we should quit and we both just quit cold turkey. He started smoking again but I never did. 
My sister has tried to quit several times and always has a mental breakdown and starts crying, screaming etc. I think it really comes down to what other people have said and that's willpower. You need to be able to tell yourself you don't *have* to smoke to get by. There are very few things you have to do, everything else is a want. The same applies to quitting smoking. You don't want to smoke, so don't. You want to quit, so do. "
"Cold turkey, got a friend of mine to quit with me as well, so that helped a bit. "
"I figured that the times I used to smoke was when I sat in a specific environment (with certain friends) and at specific times, like the waking-up cigarette, after lunch, with coffee, after dinner, and especially at bars where I was out drinking. So I kind of stopped being there or keeping myself occupied in these times, like I used to be with my boss during lunch, who hated smokers, so I tried not to smoke at that hours, I moved to juice from coffee (its just not the same taste with juice) and I stopped going to the bars with the people I smoked around with, it took time, I mean one is always thinking of going back and having one cigarette, and thats because the cold turkey starts to kick in. After i crossed this time, whenever I used to smell the cigarette smoke in the air, it just felt unpleasant. Except when I was drunk, that always made me go back, but then grew over that phase too and stopped being so shit-face drunk.
Tl;dr- Try to alter your environment/times where/when you tend to smoke. And second, one needs to go through cold-turkey."
"I quit using tobacco in the begining of December using Ecigs, the thought of using tobacco is now a thing of the past. I enjoy nicotine as much as I do caffeine,  they are both stimulants that, when used in moderation, have nominal health risks.  I don't have plans on quitting ecigs, its a guilt free way to ingest a small amount of a stimulant throughout my day.  My nic level is only 5 mg (considered very light) and I cut down from 12mg so I can use it more without feeling too ramped up."
My Grandfather got lung cancer.
"I got my first massive anxiety attack, thought it was a heart attack, went to the ER and told myself that I will never light another cigarette in my life and haven't since. It will be a year on 1st of February. If it wasn't for this, I would never do it. "
"Smoking is such a waste of money.
At $5 a pack, excluding investments, you would have $54,750 in savings at one pack a day. Now, that doesnt sound like a lot of money at first, but think about it this way: If you didnt buy one pack a day and you saved that money instead and invested it into mutual funds and got an 8% return over the long term, you would have $228,587 in 30 years! But thats not even the end to the savings!
If you used this money to pay off the principle of your Mortgage and Car loans early, not only do you save money on the cost of those loans, but you wouldnt pay 4% interest on them both! Thats 8% (roughly) interest you would have been paying! But not only that,
You could invest that money you would have spent on interest on the mortgage loans and gain 8% in the markets with little to no risk. You stopped smoking, saved on insurance cost, saved on mortgage and car loans, and pay for your retirement. All from not smoking! Hooray! Now do you still feel like having a cig?"
My wife's nagging. No joke. That's how I quit. 
"Going to ask a question here...how can I get a family member or someone close to stop smoking? Ultimately I understand it's not for me to decide, but is there a way?"

"Will power. I smoked for 15 years. Grow some balls and try to pick up other things worth you time. Read, exercise, don't hang with people that smoke. Good luck"
"My doctor told me how bad my bloodwork was, basically laid out that I had heart health of someone twice my age and that I'd have the headstone to match if I didn't do something about it.  My triglycerides and LDL levels were double the threshold for ""high"" at age 30 and 190 lbs. (I'm 6'2"".)  He gave me three months to get it under control with diet and lifestyle changes before he started me on any prescriptions, and when I asked about possible contributing factors the biggest one that I felt I could realistically change was smoking.  I threw out the half a pack I had left after exiting the doctor's office and that was it.  Half a week of crankiness later and I was over the worst of it.  Three months later my levels were right at the threshold of ""high"" instead of double, and my doctor decided it wasn't quite time for medication yet.  That was the only major lifestyle change, by the way.  No additional exercise, maybe a little more fiber in my diet (bowl of oatmeal for breakfast once in a while), and no smoking.  That's all it took.
tl;dr - ""YOU'RE GOING TO DIE"" is a much more powerful motivator for quitting smoking when it comes in the form of potential heart failure by 35 as opposed to cancer at 70."
"Not a smoker myself, but a coworker from a couple years ago had been a smoker for 20+ years. One day he came into work and said he was going to quit that day, and we all laughed. But he actually did it and hasn't smoked at all in the past 2 years. He still went outside on breaks and cut plastic straws into cigarette-sized pieces to chew on. Something about keeping his routine the same made it easier for him to quit. Maybe it would work for you too?"
"My girlfriend of 4 years told me at the beginning of us dating 
"" getitgirl1, if you smoke, then we don't have sex."" 
Officially of the cigarettes for 3 years 2 months and, 21 days."
"Cold turkey may have the best results but everyone is different. Telling people its the only way makes it so that alot of people don't even try because they feel they don't have the will power. I quit after starting with champex then when that wasn't working I got Alan Carr's easyway on audio book on my phone that way it was always with me to cheer me on worked like a charm for me.  So study after study that shows cold turkey as the best does not take into account of the brain washing by people saying its that only way. The goal is to quit do what you got to do to do it. 
Edit: although in the end there will always be that last smoke and its cold turkey from there on. "
"As said before. Cold turkey. It works wonders. However, the oral fixation was a big thing for me so I chewed toothpicks for a while when I was quitting and that helped a lot. 
TL;DR Cold Turkey+Chew Toothpicks"
(Smoked for 12 years) 3.5 years ago I quit smoking and started dipping Copenhagen. Then I started chewing the nicotine gum about a year ago and ended up addicted to it. 6 months ago I weened off the gum with orbit and nicotine patches. I don't even have cravings anymore!
"I quit 3 years ago using Chantix. It never thought that it would work so well but it did. I really don't even think about smoking anymore. It's almost as if I never smoked in the first place. I never had any of the negative side effects either, but everyone reacts differently to Chantix."
maybe you have tried the wrong ecigs   http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/
Honestly cold turkey and time. After 15 years of smoking (age 15 to 30)I tried the patch and smoked more with it then with out(Just gave me a constant craving for a cigarette). Tried gum and could never remember to actually take it places. Tried the electronic cigarettes and they just weren't as satisfying. 
Nobody likes a quitter.
Electronic cigarette
"[Chantix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varenicline)! In non-american countries it's called Champix. You just take some pills for a few weeks and the need to smoke very quickly subsides. I had been smoking for around 5 years and quit in less than a week using these pills.
You have to keep taking them for a while, and while you do you should focus on getting rid of the habitual part of smoking. Figure out what to do in the scenarios where you would usually have a cigarette. Replace the habit with something else, and in the long run you wont even need the ""else"".
The only side-effects that I experienced was mild nausea shortly after taking the pill, especially if I hadn't eaten - and *insanely* vivid dreams! The last part was really fun and very often had lucid dreams where I knew I was dreaming and could conciously make choices within the dream.
After taking the pills for some weeks I ended up selling the remaining pills to a friend who wanted to quit because I felt like I didn't need them anymore.
It's been 1 year and 3 weeks now since I quit, and not once have I craved for a cigarette!
Good luck."
"I smoked for more than 10 years. Starting with a pack a day then two packs a day. I never really wanted to quit but I HAD to because I was very short on money at that time. So I had to choose between smoking or food.
I set a date and smoked my last cigarette on August 18th 2013 at 03:00 and went cold turkey. No champix, stickers or any other kind of medicine, just straight cold turkey. It was hard at the beginning, especially the first week but I'm on this site that keeps your days and after X days/weeks you get a picture/medal thingy. I recently got my 150 day picture:) 
What helped me the most in the beginning was water. I'm talking LOTS of water. I had 5-6 bottles of water in my refrigerator at all times and whenever I was behind my pc, I had a bottle of water near me. Whenever I had an urge to smoke, I took a sip of water. I remember going to the bathroom a lot more at first and that helped me as well. Meditation has been a great help for me as well, it's a great way to deal with addiction.
What was most important to me was that I take it slow and I always said to myself ""I can't smoke I DON'T have the money"". That's how I motivated myself and pulled myself through the first week or two. After that all the other things started motivating me like, my improved health, no more stinking, food that tastes better, people no longer frown at me for being near them and so on!
What I'm most proud of, and I think it might help other people, is that I took this battle against nicotine day by day and I kept count. Every single day that I didn't smoke was a victory."
"I left my old lifestyle completely.
I left my city, left my friends, moved abroad and cycled all the way there. I had to quite 2months before the cycling so it didn't kill me.
Every day I wasn't smoking I was looking at everyone who did and thinking ""I'm better than you"". The boost to my ego was enough to do it.
Once away from everyone and everything you don't need in your life it's easier to create the person you want to be."
"My wife quit... which pretty much meant I was quitting. But seriously it has to be a conscious wholehearted decision, until then relapse is inevitable. I quit on NYE so I'm at 30 days today... that's like almost officially an ex-smoker. "
"10 years ago when Ireland banned smoking in all public places I quit, couldn't be arsed having to stand outside so smoke. I remember that last night in the pub, I must have smoked 40 cigarettes, there were people who never go to the pub there just for the novelty of being among the last pub smokers in Ireland. "
"I smoked for 16yrs and used a combo if chantrix and becoming an aunt.  My sister sent me a pic of my baby nephew everyday asking if I wanted him to know me as a smoker.  And no, no i didn't!  But how I physically did it with chantrix. The drug has horrible side effects, and I got off it as quick as possible.  But what my doc told me side effect less than smoking (although watch for suicidal thoughts).  Been 5  yrs, and can imagine starting again."
"For me, watching how nasty people look while smoking was the nail in the coffin. You just have to decide that you don't want it anymore and constantly remind yourself that it's a waste of time, money, and health. "
"Might not help you, or anyone else really but the one thing that stopped me smoking cigarettes was weed. Honestly , My rationale was that I would rather get high than turn off nicotine cravings and to my surprise I didnt really want any tobacco while I was high, this probably wont help you at work though :P"
"It's been 11 months, 1 day, 16 hours since I had my last cigarette. I use an iPhone app called QuitIt to track the time. I'll check it every week or so just to remind myself of when I quit. It's free. 
The only thing that helped me to quit was Chantix. That stuff is amazing. I was smoking a pack a day for almost 7 years. I'd tried quitting cold turkey a few times but the longest I ever went was a month. 
Even with Chantix, it took 3 tries over the course of two years before it finally stuck. Each time completely worked and I'd quit, but being around friends that smoked kept pulling me back in. Most of my friends have stopped smoking since then, so that combined with just being completely done with it has led to this last time being permanent. 
People talk a lot of shit about Chantix. Like any medication, it surely has some bad symptom for a tiny, less than a tenth of a percent of people. But for *most* people, it's fine. 
You get some vivid dreams. Not nightmares, just super techno color versions of normal dreams. 
You keep smoking like normal, but over the course of 2-3 weeks, you start noticing the cigarettes taste bad. You also start losing the compulsive need to smoke. Within a month, you just don't want to smoke any more because it's gross. 
I could talk about the biology of how it works, but don't have the time. 
If you really want to quit, but like me and have a slightly addictive personality and cold turkey doesn't work, I highly recommend trying it. "
"Doing Ibogaine and fucking my brains out.
Protip : Don't expect to do both at the same time."
"Electronic cigarettes have been really wonderful, if you're someone who likes to smoke but knows it's terrible for you. "
"I tried many times, but to actually get me to quit was my organism. A year and a half ago I bought my last pack of cigarettes, and I didn't enjoy smoking at all anymore, so I stopped. And when I saw somebody smoking - I found myself instead of starving for a cigarette, being happy I don't need to do that anymore. Right now I never think about having a cigarette, and I am happy that I saved so much money because of thath."
"I quit cold turkey but with the aid of ""The easy way to quit smoking"" by Allen Carr. The book was a crutch for me during the first few weeks as those are the most brutal. 
He makes a lot of parallels with cigarettes and heroin usage in that you're only smoking because you're addicted. You don't actually like it.
I carried that thing with me everywhere and every time I felt an urge I'd pick up the book and read little pieces of it to remind myself that it's an addiction vs a pleasure which I used to think.
Best of luck on quitting and know that it will be one of the best life decisions you can make."
Dip.
"As a stepstone, switch to pipe smoking. It's time consuming (to prepare the pipe, smoke it, clean it) and you will convert a periodic event into something more of a ritual. Then trim down on that progressively. 
"
"Go on holiday. A change of scenery, travel no stress and none of your traditional smoking cues. Worked for me. "
Just stop buying them. 
"Honestly, treating them like candy bars. I dont buy packs anymore but ill have one every so often and it helps get me out of the habit"
"Not my story but my father quit.
He said once when I was younger I had the chicken pox disease. Although it's not very dangerous for kids, it can get extremly dangerous for adults. My father told me now 10 years later, that he almost died from it. He spend days to weeks on the couch trying to recover from it. As he saw himself in the mirror almost looking like a dead body, he decided he wanted to live a healthier life. And he stopped smoking cigs, drinking coffe and alcohol that day and never got back to it. He still has his last pack of tobacco untouched in the drawer. My father is a strong man."
"Getting involved with a trail running community. Group support, competitive reasons not to smoke, attractive people in spandex hugging me. 3 years later and I'm running ultra, not smokin 2 packs a day, and having a blast."
"I started doing Brazilian jiujitsu and I was just so into it, I didn't want anything to mess up my bjj game. I was also lifting weights and adjusting my diet so I would have enough protein and carbs for energy, I became more health conscious and it didn't make sense to undermine all these things I valued by smoking cigarettes.  
So I read Allan Carr's ""Easy way to stop smoking"" Canadian edition, which my uncle had  given me 2 years earlier. The premise of the book is that you are more psychologically addicted to nicotine than you are physically addicted.  You are actually supposed to keep smoking until you finish the book.
That's how I quit after almost 10 years smoking. 
Tl;dr: I set quitting smoking as a worthwhile pursuit in my mind and read Allan Carr's ""Easy way."""
"I smoked for 15 years. 
Back in 2006 I saw a newspaper AD about a full day seminar based on the ""Easyway"" method by Allen Carr. 
They were claiming the 80% of success, and they told me that if I wouldn't quit in the next three months, I would get refunded of my money.
So I told myself: ""even if I quit for only a couple months"" that's health gained!
I went to that seminar knowing that I was actually enjoying smoking, and we were encouraged to smoke throughout the day.
No shock methods were involved but only the realization of why you're actually putting your cigarette in your mouth.
I quit that same day, 8 years ago. Never looked back."
"I was never a heavy smoker, maybe 1/2 pack a day for about 10 - 15 years. When I was finally ready to quit, I read a book called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. It was kind of a tedious read, but it breaks down all the reasons you think you enjoy smoking so by the end of the book you don't even want a cigarette anymore. 
I was able to quit while living in the Middle East where packs were $1.50 and you could smoke anywhere. Been smoke-free for almost a decade now and that book was a big reason why.
(I'm not affiliated with Allen Carr in any way shape or form. In fact I downloaded his book as a PDF so I'm not even a paying customer :P)"
"Cold. Turkey.
Alternative sources of nicotine leave you still addicted, and e-Cigs leave you hooked on the oral AND chemical aspect. 
I smoked for 26 years. Patches gave me a rash, gum was nasty, and Chantix was scary. I lit up for the last time in the wee hours of January 1, 2009, making sure it was my last one in the pack. I got up later that day, and thought ""I'm gonna see how long I can go today without a smoke."" 
Through lunch, through dinner, all the way to bedtime, I used my infinite powers of procrastination to just keep putting my next smoke off for five more minutes. 
That was my key - don't look at it as this huge lifetime thing. Just don't smoke right now. You can put off smoking for a few minutes, you've done it a million times. Just put it off for a while. Connect the whiles.
You're going to be a crabby bitch. Warn those around you. If they give the tiniest shit about you, they'll deal with your moods. The first three days are kinda rough, then it starts to smooth out. Sometime in month three, your brain will deactivate the nicotine receptors that cause the physical addiction. For me, that was more uncomfortable than the first three days. Crazy cravings in my itchy brain for a week or so. Then it's gone... the physical need I mean. The mental habit never completely goes away. A moment of stress, a really good meal, something will trigger the old knee-jerk reaction to light up. 
Chuckle at your silly brain's old dead habit, and continue living healthier, happier, and with more money in your pocket.
You may gain a bit of weight, yes, because food tastes and smells better now, and your mouth craves something to do... but you can do more physical things and breathe better now too. Walk off the cravings, jog in place until you're winded, do pushups. Use the nicotine frustration to power your way through. I gained 30 pounds over two years, and have already lost 20 of them just walking briskly for 20 minutes a day - far less time than I used to spend freezing/sweating outside smoking. 
26 years a smoker, five years nicotine-free this month. You can do it."
"I quit because I had a new girlfriend who I really wanted to make a good impression with. I also wanted to make out with her without grossing her out and smelling like ass. 
Being able to kiss new girlfriend was a great motivator. Also I went cold turkey. "
"I quit the day I found out I was pregnant, cold turkey, it was really hard but I found not putting a cigarette ibetween my lips and lighting it definitely helped. Good luck x"
"Electronic cigarette. 
I tried the ones you're probably using (liquor store cheap ones) and ended up smoking real ones anyway. 
I then spent a long time researching different models of ""high end"" e-cigs and ended up spending $100 on the device and all the stuff associated with it; juice, extra atomizers, etc. 
Well worth the cost. I never had to make another order, I successfully quit (last one in April 2013) and now I don't even use the e-cig. 
Good luck! "
"7years in 3years out.
LSD and DMT. Sounds like a longshot but over a period of time, ego manipulation and self evaluation on these drugs I came to a point where I was disgusted with smoking. I didnt understand what, if any benefit I was getting from it. I told myself cigarettes helped when I was stressed, kept me from eating too much, were relaxing and so on... But really they only gave my hands something to do and tricked me into thinking I felt resolved. Never did I get any benefit from them and that made me feel like an idiot. 
I met my girlfriend, we started dating and then she started talking about a future with me. On top of my psychedelic found disgust in my habit I started thinking about marriage and children and life.... I put out my last cigarette and declared I was done. Havnt smoked since. No tapering, no craving, no thougts... The only way and real way to quit is to want to... If you dont want to, you have no chance. Really look at your life... Can you really say you LIKE smoking? You know what you would like? An extra $5 in your pocket every day... All you have to do is want it bad enough and its yours."
"I decreased from 1/2 pack a day to few cigs a week, when me and hubby started to talk children. 10 years of on/off smoking stopped the minute the test was positive."
edibles and vaping.. blunts hurt my throat and made me cough 
"I also believe Cold Turkey is best. My story adds to that. I was buying smokes online in around 2002 because I could still buy from indian reservations for about $10 a carton. When I got a large shipment in one day I was disgusted at the cost. I decided to quit, like many do ""after these"" but instead of a pack or carton, it was 10 cartons. So every day I pulled a pack from the pyramid of smokes I made on my dresser, my sub-conscience knew I was one more day closer to being a non smoker.
By the time I hit the last 3 packs, I couldn't even inhale anymore and they tasted nasty. I was done! I guess the added time I had for my brain to learn not to smoke helped because I had failed many times before that.
My last cig was feb 1 2003.
TL/DR It takes time to teach and old brain new tricks. "
"I tried gum, patch, etc... the only thing that actually worked for me was the fear and shame of letting down my significant other whom i'd promised that I would quit. It worked so effectively that now years later, I do not like the smell or taste of smoke and don't have cravings. It was a very intense feeling and worked perfectly!"
Getting a job in health care where smoking was very frowned upon.  I quit cold turkey.  Peer pressure ftw!
Electronic cigarette. Head over to /r/ECR to get advices for good starter pack.
"I don't know if I am considered ab ex smoker but I smoked for the better part of a year and then quit cold turkey, haven't had one since April of 2013"
"A week ago I bought a refillable e cig. That has helped a lot, as well as having a friend who is quitting with me. She has bummed a couple of cigarettes, but I chapped her ass about it and she doesn't do it anymore."
"For me, it was chantix, combined with quitting during the summer (major trigger) and avoiding most triggers (coffee, drinking, bars).  After the 1st month, I didn't have cravings.  Also, taking a walk during your smoke break instead of smoking."
Was in a long distance relationship for a year in a 3 year relationship. She hated it. Got engaged a few weeks ago. Quit it immediately. I don't feel any difference in my life now. Except that I don't know what to do on smoke breaks. 
"I'll tell you what worked for me, take or leave the parts you can use. I had the opportunity to quit when I moved to a new city and didn't know anyone. Not hanging out with smokers was probably the #1 biggest help. #2 was using the patch. In my experience the patch takes the edge off the anger you get with withdraw, but helps very little with the urge to smoke itself. If you know how the patch will help, you won't rely on it for what it wont help you with. #3 for me was the mental battle with myself. Myself would work 24/7 convincing myself that I should have a cigarette. Once I new that was going to happen I was able to recognize it for what it was and it helped me."
"Zyban, a few pieces of gun (not many) and that's about it. I took the zyban for about a month before I quit smoking. It made everything taste weird and I just woke up one day and didn't smoke."
stop it ...stop it right meow 
Starting with two of the maximum dose patches.
I'd smoked for 12 years. 20 a day. Cigarettes were expensive. When I bought property the agent lied about the service charges and I couldn't afford to smoke unless I didn't eat. My will to survive was stronger than the will to smoke. After 3 months I got a raise but the habit was broken. Almost 10 years free now. 
"Ex 30 a day smoker. I stopped smoking when i got a really nasty, chesty cold. It worked , i assume, because a) I was less inclined to have a cigarette when i was coughing my guts up making cold turkey easier and  b) I related the severity of my cough to my smoking, so , whenever I felt tempted, I pictured myself with that nasty cough to put me off. "
"Everyone I've recommended this to has quit... it's a bit unconventional, but it works.  I smoked packs a day for 8 years, quit once, started again a year later and smoked for two years, then quit again and that time for good.  I've been smoke\nicotine free for 6 years now.
Find a long weekend where you can literally shirk just about all responsibilities for 3-4 days.  A lame holiday like MLK Jr. day where there isn't a lot of family stuff, etc going on works great.  On the day you decide to quit, go as long as you can without having a smoke.  The second you know you're going to cave, go outside an jog for 30 minutes.  It's going to suck balls, but just fucking do it.  As soon as you step back into your house\apt\abode take a sedating dose of benadryl.  About 50-75mgs.  Take a shower, by the time your shower is over you'll be ready to fall asleep.  
Repeat as necessary.  Sure, you'll lose your entire weekend, but after the 2nd or 3rd day, you will get surprising relief from the exercise and you won't need to sleep through the craving.
It sounds stupid, but it's not dangerous and it works."
"Whenever I wanted to go for a smoke, I ate something really tasty. I am amazed to this day how relatively easy it was to substitute tobacco with food. Not just any food, it has to be really munchy/crunchy/tasty!"
"Rubber Band Method: place a strong rubber band around your wrist. When you feel a craving pull that sucker back as far as it will go and let'r go..WHAP! Then say, ""I don't want to be addicted any more"" 10 times. (you can just think it). Two weeks and you will not want to smoke again."
"I know how to stop smoking.
The addiction in smoking isn't nicotine, it's dopamine. Every time you light up, your brain gives itself a nice little burst of the most enjoyable drug known to science.
Being a long-term smoker means you've trained your brain to deliver dopamine whenever you smoke. It's not just the act of smoking, because the brain learns to anticipate - from the second you *decide* to have a smoke, as you get up, walk out, get out your pack, put one in your mouth, and light it up... the whole time your brain is licking it's squidgy lips at the thought of all that dopamine it's going to receive.
You can only stop smoking by retraining your brain to deliver dopamine every time you *reject* a cigarette.
This is why ex-smokers so quickly become holier-than-thou. Because the feeling of smugness is an excellent way to put dopamine into your brain. ""I'm better than those idiots still smoking"" - this is the type of thought that will give you a dopamine buzz as long as you truly believe it.
I don't know what the answer is for *you*. But unless you find a way to turn off the connection between smoking and dopamine production, you are going to have a very difficult time quitting, and staying quit.
edit: I should mention that I still smoke after 30 years. But I've had more serious problems to worry about - I'm just this week clean after 4 years in a methadone program. The funny thing is that I'm in excellent health for someone my age, smoker or not. I think the primary reason is that I stopped drinking alcohol 20 years ago, and stopped overeating about 10 years ago.
The second thing perhaps worth mentioning is the value of cutting back. I tried various things and none of them seemed to work. Then I tried smoking a pipe. Traditional pipe tobacco is a fucking wet mess and is actually kind of tricky to use. What I do now is buy a pack of cigarettes and break them up to get the tobacco out. Then I smoke it through a pipe. Usually one or two puffs is all I take when I would previously have a whole cigarette.
This way, one pack lasts me about two weeks. I was previously on 30-40 cigarettes a day.
I'm not particularly interested in the difficulty of giving up completely. I've had enough of that in recent years with my other vices. At this reduced level I'm just hoping lung cancer is curable by the time I'm dying of it. I can't wait to get my new lungs grown from my own stem cells on a scaffold. ;)"
"Here is what I did, I got a big ass jar and threw the money for a pack of smokes in there whenever I would normally buy a pack... I just let this save up and I quite cold turkey. This jar was right next to my bed across the room so I could see every morning the money I used to smoke away and now that money is sitting in the form of a big ass TV in my living room a constant reminder of what a waste smoking is."
Cold turkey. Smoked for 10 years and haven't had one cigarette in almost 9 months.
"I wasn't smoking for very long, maybe half a year at most. One day I kept feeling nauseated after each puff. I gave up half way through and decided to quit. Took me my third try to be successful.
"
"Cold turkey! I said ""this is it"" and gave it up. No smoking less and diminishing the amount until you only have one a day. Just quit. Mentally reward yourself for every hour you're able to make it, then every half day, then every day. Keep giving yourself a pat on the back and constantly remind yourself how much better you will feel. The hardest part is wanting to give in. Just think how far you've come and what a waste it will be to give that up. The first day is the hardest and gets easier as you go. Chew sugarfree gum. After about a week you'll notice you can breathe a bit better and your head feels clearer. Another thing that helped me was the support of my family and knowing how upset my kids were at the thought of me going back.
Good luck to anyone that tries. Don't give up on yourself. Force yourself to do it and don't let anything get in the way of quiting. 
End rant."
"Pneumonia. I got it really bad last February and couldn't get out of bed. My apartments are completely non-smoking anywhere on the grounds so between the sickness, the rules, and the snow outside, I didn't smoke for about a week. When I felt better, I just never started up again and have been smoke free ever since.
Also, shout out to my people at /r/stopsmoking."
"Put a patch on, have a cup of coffee when it starts to tingle/itch. It's a great buzz. Almost like having a drink. Wears off in about 15 minutes, but kept me going.
I tried gum, ecigs, tapering off, cold turkey, etc. this was the only thing that worked."
"I smoked a little more than a pack a day, from a habit that spanned the better part of ten years. The last time I had a cigarette was on January 4th, 2012. I've saved $4125.65 by not smoking. Haven't missed it one bit, I can still hang out around my friends who smoke like chimneys and it doesn't bother me. 
What worked for me was nicotine gum. I'd been sick with a really bad recurring case of bronchitis (go figure), it was cold as balls outside, and simply by not being able to breathe, I'd only had about 4 a day for the first few days of January. I eventually said ""fuck this!"", went and got nicotine gum, and haven't looked back since. The combination of dedication, and a crutch to help me withdraw from the nicotine dependance was probably the winning combo.
My lung capacity has improved dramatically, along with the improvement in taste and smell. The vivid dreams of smoking, then waking up feeling guilty still linger, but not nearly as often as they did initially. It is totally worth quitting if you are serious about not wanting it anymore. "
The look on my co-workers faces when I went outside to smoke.
Could I also add to the question? How have you successfully stopped chewing tobacco?
I was fairly determined about quitting and humble enough to admit that there's no middle ground (rare cigars or occasional party smoking) for me. I switched my addiction from smoking to the nicotine gum. I used it the same way in same places and went for cig breaks with coworkers and all that. After few years of that stopped that too at point there was no way in hell I'd ever smoke again. I still miss the nicotine gum though. Tl;dr after 15 years of everyday smoking nicotine gum worked well.
"I knew an Englishman in his 70's, had been smoking most of his life. He quit cold turkey. I realized if he could do it, I could too.  "
"My pops used a variety of dried fruits as a way to curb the oral habit (after smoking 2 packs a day). I think that's a pretty good way to go about it since you'll obviously still want that 'release' (taking a break) so finding something to replace it (some people just suck on a straw, but that looks a bit odd) can help weaning off."
"Weaning off a pack a day habit now for a month and a half, cold turkey. Recently read that drinking black tea helps with curbing the nicotine craving. So, I've been delving into tea as my new habit. It takes as much time to properly prepare a black tea as it would to smoke a whole cigarette, so it's soothing the craving and replacing the ""ritual"" aspect of smoking with steeping the tea. It's really helped out, because it tackles not only the physical addiction but the mental reliance on it. "
"Cold Turkey.
It was in tandem with pulling wisdom teeth."
"Can't speak for myself, but for my Dad who quit way before I entered the picture. He said to do it he bought a carton (or maybe a few packs, can't remember the details) of the grosses unfiltered cigs he could find and then chain smoked them till he was nauseous. After that it was -easy- to go cold turkey."
"**FEAR**
* I don't want to talk about it but you can imagine why I stopped cold turkey one day after 20+ years. Previous attempts- nic gum, nic patches, nic lozenge, chantix"
"You have to want to stop. If its done by someone else suggesting it, it probably won't stick. I decided that there's no real reason to smoke. Still smoke 'erb without tobacco but I looked at it like "" this cigarette dosen't get me high. Fuck it these are boke!"" The first day in which you would normally be smoking a lot (work, studies etc) is fucking murder! For myself after the first day all thoughts of smoking were gone. Twas like the first hurdle if you like. Now I just have to stick to it."
"Honestly for me it was will power and being ready, oh and lots of coffee and tea.  I simply was ready mentally and quit after 20 years of smoking a pack a day.  I drank an excessive amount of tea and coffee though."
"Cold turkey here..  Finally I became disgusted with the habit and got it in my mind to quit.  The first week was the worst, and then I just figured if I started again why did I waste that week or two weeks etc.. Today I cannot stand the smell of smoke and smokers 
Before I finally quit for good, I quit buying several times.."
It was a slow thing of thinking about the pros and cons over a couple of years. Was at work and realized I hated the taste so much I gagged while smoking. On the way home picked up some patches and used them for two weeks after almost 10 year at a pack and a half a day. The funny thing was that the smell of cigarette smoke after that became nauseating and really helped me keep from going back. Even five years later I can't stand the smell bow and it is the largest turn off for me now. Scarlett johansen could be about to go down on me but if I see her or smell smoke on her Id lose all attraction to her and go flaccid immediately.
"I am on day 60. I was a pack a day smoker for ten years. The vaporizer really helped with my cravings. Buying a vaporizor is the only thing I did differently, I am also not addicted to the vape, I bring it with me in social settings because I know there will always bee a slight craving for cigs, but this satisfies the crave. 
 The thing that got me to resent cigs the most was imagining my Fiance or my parents watch me die from some stupid disease that I could have prevented by quitting smoking. Watching the ""truth"" commercials, and seriosly imaginging one of those people being me in 20 years was just unfathomable.   
I came to realize that I am better than cigarettes, and THIS SUBREDDIT really showed me how evil cigarettes are, and that there are 20,000 others right here with me.

 I know this sounds cliche' but if I can do it, anyone can!"
My mom bet me 500 bucks I couldn't quit.
Wanting to quit more than wanting to smoke.
"My method is a controversial one; I used an e-cig.  I used it for 3 months, progressively tapering my nicotine level down to zero, at which point I stopped using it.  It's not typically recommended as a quit method, because it basically prolongs the withdrawals, and people end up not tapering off, but I was able to muster up the will power to make it work.  I'm still not completely out of the woods, but I haven't smoked in 6 months, and cravings are pretty rare at this point.
Also, I took the first 3 days off work to get through the initial withdrawals.  If you have to do this, it's absolutely worth it."
"Do NOT take the first one again. 1 is too much, 1000 is not enough. Addiction."
Low dose Bupropion (generic Wellbutrin) and the patch. Chantix is overpriced garbage. The Wellbutrin helps you to be less of a dick once you've quit and helps with the cravings. 
"I was stressing out about not having money ever. Pay $60 towards credit card, use that $60 towards cigarettes. Then one day after the price of a pack went up again I was driving home from work and decided I was gonna quit. Got home, ran my last 5 cigarettes under the faucet and went on the patch.
The patch messed me up. I was having crazy dreams but it ended up working. Now I only smoke when I'm with my friends. Some say I didn't really quit, but when I can see that $80+ in my bank account because I stopped smoking on a daily basis, I feel like I quit."
"I quit three times in total. The first time was cold turkey and I stayed clean for a year. The second time was champix and I quit within a week for 6 months until life happened, then the last time which was successful, I quit using champix again. I've been clean for nearly three years now"
"I never wanted to quit. I miss the 5 minutes to myself or the comraderie of a break between classmates. I was broke and cigarette in Seattle were $8. It was eat or smoke. There was a time when I ate a cup of rice a day. Unemployment really blows. I smoked Marlboro Red and weened myself off. That was 5 years ago. I'm good now. Sometimes I'll have a cigarette or two if I'm out drinking with other smokers, but I definitely feel (and smell) like shit the next day. My parents quit with medicine, again slowly weening themselves off. I truly believe it takes 21 days to kick (or start) any habit. I stopped drinking soda and biting my nails that way. Good luck. "
"one day my lungs started to hurt. I mean they really hurt. Breathing hurt. Then as time went on i realized that the poison in the smoke does to my body. I saw how it wrinkles your face, makes your body turn green in color. your eyes sink into your skull. The smell. The awful smell."
"First of all I always felt guilty about smoking because my parents quit. I tried cold turkey but failed hard. I then started chewing nicorette and stayed on the largest dose (4mg I think) for a year. This tranferred the addiction to chewing instead of puffing. I still chew 3 pieces of gum a day, but my lungs feel 10 times better."
"Ecig. You said you already had one and its not working for you, but what do you have? The blue type cigalikes or an ego type kit? You have to approach ecigs as if you are quitting analogs cold turkey, its just much easier as you keep the oral habit and the nicotine but in auch safer medium. Head over to r/electronic_cigarette and browse around. If you invest a little more $$ you will get a much more satisfying experience. "
Cold turkey!
Ziban did the trick for me.
"Kurt Vonnegut jr described smoking as ""a socially acceptable way of committing suicide."" This, together with various statistics about smoking (not so much death rates as data about *who* predominantly smokes - prisoners, mental health patients etc) led me to the revelation that I wasn't smoking because I enjoyed it, or because I wanted to, but because I hated myself and needed to. It's like any form of self-harm. You need to stop fooling yourself about your motives before you do anything else.
Once I came to this realisation, I gave up cold turkey. Each time, I destroyed the cigarettes I had last thing at night, meaning the next morning the only way I could smoke was to buy more. It took me 4 or 5 attempts, but I haven't now smoked for over 10 years."
"I quit cold turkey, 15 years ago.
I kept a pack next to my bed, and personalized it - if I dug into that pack for a smoke, Tobacco would have won.
It was difficult for about a month, and after that the cravings came less regularly.
At this point I can smoke the odd cigar (maybe once a year) and still not have a craving for cigarettes.
And I can run half marathons, do triathlons, bicycle races and open water swimming races without wanting to die :-)"
"1) Cold turkey, 
2) Convince yourself not to buy smokes, Make it a financial decision. I can say ""I don't wanna spend 5 bucks,"" but i cant say ""i don't want a cig."" 
3) the most difficult, don't drink. At least if you don't want to smoke. 
"
"When trying to ween yourself off, DO NOT smoke during trigger situations. My triggers were: 
1. Driving 
2. After eating 
3. After/during drinking 
4. After sex 
5. After smoking cannabis
This really helps to break the habitual addiction and makes smoking less convenient and more uncomfortable. Also keeping track of how much money I saved helped. $580.89 in the past 77 days!"
"When I quit I was up to about 2 packs a day. I quit cold turkey. It took several tries, but after the third attempt I quit for good and its been about 9 years."
"I found that having a goal really helped. I had a huge hike planned in a few months so every time I wanted one I'd just think about how much more I would struggled if I didn't let my lungs recover. 
That being said I started smoking again a few weeks after the hike...Trying the ecig thing now and planning a new adventure so, I dunno, fingers crossed?"
"Here is what worked for me. 
I quit cold turkey. About three weeks later I ended up throwing a party for my bday. Had a great time and got very drunk. At the end of the night, I was offered a cig. I thought ""it's my bday, why not"". I got about halfway through the cig and it was pretty gross. Then I got the spins, threw up. That was the last cig I ever had :)
tl;dr Quit cold turkey, couple weeks later got drunk, smoked, puked...quitting successful.
"
"20 years ago I decided that if I kept smoking I had about 4 more years to live. I was tired of the stench of my clothes and my furniture. I was tired of being ostracized by my peers. I envisioned my lungs with years of built up tar. I'd quit a hundred times. Finally decided I wanted to live rather than slowly commit suicide. After the first two weeks it got easier and I found myself less disgusted by myself.
It helps to quit habits that precede smoking...unfortunately this often includes drinking. chances are if you are a heavy smoker you're also a drunk."
"In all honesty - knowing that I was ready. 
I smoked for 10 years. Heavily. Tried to quit around the 4 year mark but really liked smoking still. 
About 3 & a half years ago I realised I no longer enjoyed smoking. 
Smoked my last cigarette at a friends birthday party. Woke up the next morning & never touched another cigarette. Cold turkey. Even bought an emergency packet which I gave away, unopened, 3 days later.
Sure, I still get cravings - but when you can smell what smokers smell like,  you won't want to pick another one up. Ever. Again. "
"My doctor needed to screen me for lung cancer after being sick for a long time. I was in my early 20's and learned the reality of the damage smoking causes very quickly. I decided to quit immediately after thinking how me having cancer and dying would affect my wife. Luckily, no cancer."
"I've mentioned this before on reddit, but get yourself put in a coma. My dad was in one for about a month after a heart surgery, and when he woke up, he never wanted one again. He's been a pack a day smoker for something like 25 years. According to the doctors he basically went through withdrawal while unconscious. 
So yeah. Get a friend and a hunk of concrete. There's no way it could end badly. "
Cold turkey is the only way to do it. Just stop buying them and smoking them. After the first and worst 72 hours its easy street
"I actually just stopped smoking 6 months and 25 days ago, when I moved from California to Canada. Long story short, in California, I was around alot of negative shit, going from the people who I hung out with (Who most were felons and stuff reputable people) and did alot of drugs. The few good people I hung out with, would always ask me to do things for them (Everything from moving furniture to paying for entire trips for us to travel up and down the state, at the time I truely did think they were my true friends)
I quit smoking 100 different times, for a week sometimes to an entire year. What finally did it for me, was when I started realizing how much money I was spending on cigarettes, realizing very quickly that it was why I couldn't move out of my mom's house, it was why I couldn't get a car and everything else. From there (I smoked pot for the first time) and cigarettes never tasted the same afterwards, they actually tasted like absolute shit.
Apon moving to Canada with girlfriend (Who is now my wife), she told me I wasn't allowed to smoke anymore. We now live with her parents (Who both smoke) but I don't get the urge to smoke anymore. Mainly what did it for me, was when I smoked pot, I realized how much money I was wasting and truely how much damage cigarettes were doing. I also started realizing, I was paying about 2000 dollars a year for what? Somthing to shorten my life. I also realized that I was in a very negative environment and I needed to get out of that.
TLDR: Smoked pot for the first time, it made me start thinking about how much money I was paying a year for a product that was just ultimately killing me. In other words, I was paying for someone to kill me, which seemed counter productive."
"Hello reddit.
Just wanted to share my situation with you.  I still love cigs.  Fucking love'em. And I've been clean for about 4 years.  At my peak, I smoked about 2 packs a day.  How did I quit? My gf promised me bjs, and lots of sex... and it worked.  While it's easy to hide from a non-smoker that you're still smoking (febreeze/shower/listerine), one thing you can't hide is the smell of cigs that oozes from your lungs in the mornings. Trust me, they can tell if you're still smoking or not! 
My gf's dad is a heavy smoker, and she's always hated guys that smoke.  I had promised to quit Jan 1st, and it really took me until Jan 15th or so to truly go cold turkey.  Was I cranky all the time? Yes.  Did I struggle?  God yes.  The hardest day was the first time I drank heavily at a birthday party.  That night, I picked up a cigarette, looked at it, and just shrugged... gave it back.  And that night, I had more sex.
After 30 days, it was steak and BJ Day.  60 days?  steak and BJ Day.  100 days?  She let me finish inside her for the first time in our relationship.  (Besttttt feeling.... everrrrr) O_O
We're not together anymore, but damn, I am so thankful of those days, and thankful that she helped me quit.  Thank you Jina, for saving my lungs, my life, one hump at a time..."
"My insurance broker told me he can reduce my premium by almost $100 a month if I tested clean for nicotine and it takes about 8 weeks to be able to do that (allegedly). So I knew I couldn't slip up and have that ONE cigarette. I planned on going back to smoking after, but once all was said and done, I was smoke free for around 3 months, so I didn't want to undo all that work."
"Cold turkey. I smoked for 5 years, and one day while playing basketball I felt like I was having a heart attack. It shook me. I went home, broke the rest of my pack in half and threw them in the trash. The first month sucked and the rest of the year was filled with cravings and trying to bargain with myself to pick up a pack for old times sake. Stay strong. If you truly want to quit, you will. "
"Have a child.  Once they're 5 years old, have them tell you sincerely to stop smoking because they don't want you to die.  Stop smoking cold turkey the next day.  Fin."
"I switched to cigars, so instead of a filthy daily habit, I have classy indulgence about once a month."
"I set a hard date about 3 months out. Every time I lit up, I told myself hey you've only got ___ till this isn't happening anymore. I didn't taper off, I didn't do patches, gum, or any of that. Then, on the date, i just woke up, kept myself busy all day and then... that was it. 
I just kept reminding myself that, a craving only lasts 8 seconds. Its pretty much like riding a bull. Just hang on for 8 seconds. Don't try to kid yourself that you're not on a bull. Embrace the craving. Swim around in it. It SUCKS! But, just don't kid yourself. It's either these cravings or going back to smoking. 
I've gone 14 months and haven't touched a smoke. Not a puff. I barely even think about them anymore. 
Good luck!
EDIT: I smoked for 16 years. Pack a day. "
"I quit years ago, when I was 22. Lots and lots of chupachups lollys and I decided to take a break from going to bars for a few months"
"Electronic cigarette!!! Havent had a smoke in three years, cuz of my ecig. Now even the thought of smoking is disgusting, anytime I smell someone smoking, I in no way want to join them. E-cigs are a good way to go."
"Snus. It gives a bit of that roast flavor. You can pop them in your mouth at any time, and no one would know. Plus, it gives a strong dose of nicotine.
While I'm still addicted to nicotine, the delivery method is so much safer. I read a study done in Australia that switching from smoking to Snus had the same health benefits as cold turkey.
Also, starting an exercise program helps a ton. It provides that bump in adrenaline and dope, but also stress relief at the same time (akin to cigs)"
" I know you said you had an electronic cigarette, but do you have an efficient one that produces enough smoke? If you arent satisfied with the quality of vapor your ecig produces its hard to want to use it as a substitute. I work at an Electronic Cigarette (Vape) store, and I help people with there smoking problem all day. I feel that we are so lucky to finally have an effective way to stop smoking. PM me if you have any questions!"
My friend quit with me. I didn't know we were going thru with it until he called me out on it. Haven't had one since. Its been over a year.
"Edit: disclaimer: I too worked in health care and I feel your pain dude. Snacks. Hidden, secret, snacks were my solace.
So about your quitting question.. Well...death stopped my dad. Not the threat of it, he just actually died. If impending lung cancer doesn't do it for ya I don't know what will.
They say it's more difficult to quit than heroin. Availability and addictive properties & all that.
My advice as a smoker survivor, REPLACE YOUR ADDICTION. I know that probably seems like bad advice or something but trust me, you need something to wean with. Cold turkey just does not work for everybody. 
Some people use bud, some use sweets, some use just a fake cigarette rolled from paper. Now they even have ecigs.
Replace it with something you enjoy, that mentally soothes you. What you have to accept is that the drug has become your crutch and without it, you are going to feel uncomfortable for a time. 
It's like if you stopped wearing pants for years then suddenly had to go back to the straight and narrow of wearing pants at all times. It's not comfortable, not desirable, not fun. But wearing pants is a good idea for your well being and we have concrete evidence to support that.
It will take time & you'll always know what it felt like to ditch pants for so long, you'll crave ditching your pants, maybe once, twice, more etc. but you must always put the pants back on. For you see, you can always put the pants back on if you slip and take them off. But you have to have the will to say, I will put on my pants today, even if I take them off again later, putting them on now is good for my health. 
See what I'm saying? If you slip up and smoke again, you can still keep quitting. Failure is the necessary first step to success.
As far as replacing the habit, I recommend a food you love, some kind of sensory reward. Maybe a soft drink you never allow yourself. Perhaps a specialty item of produce. Maybe a video game that you left behind due to adult life but you still immensely enjoy. 
Heck, adopting a pet will occupy your time, attention and give you a psychological reward everytime you pet or play with them. Plus you're saving somebody.
Also, I think it's important to note, at the end of all this you actually can take off your pants and relax guilt free. Maybe enjoy some beef jerky with your pup or cat. And without constricting pants! Your freedom is calling you! Just some stuff to consider."
"Temperature played a big role.  Back in January of 2009, there was a span of about a week where it was single digits.  Just too cold.  So a day went by, then another day, then another day.  Each day was easier than the previous.  Took 5 or 6 days before my wife even noticed.
I smoked for 15 years.  She had been pestering me to quit for 4 years.  I wanted to quit.  But those reason weren't always enough.  Took everything.   
My Dr. told me, ""You did the single best thing you could have done for your health, but the single worst thing you could have done for your weight.""   "
"It's been 9 and a half months since I quit. I had tried gum and weening myself off slowly, but it never worked. 
I had recently moved from a city where 90% of my friends and people at parties and bars smoked to a city where almost no one does. I became that gross girl who stank like cigarettes all the time, and I didn't like it. They guy I was talking to, who's now my boyfriend, didn't like it, even though he said he didn't care. I finally got fed up with being a burden by asking my friends to wait while I smoked or being looked down upon by people who didn't smoke. Also, I have so many fancy perfumes, and it seemed like a shame to use them when I knew I would stink later anyway. 
I got an app that tracks how long it's been since you quit, the health benefits you have reached and the money you saved. I basically went cold turkey because I decided I was finally done."
A shrooms trip made me realize how shitty it is. Plain and simple. So I guess cold turkey.
Getting pregnant 
"Cold turkey. You just have to make a decision, pick a date, and refuse to fail. Worked for me and everyone else I know who succeeded. I've never seen anything else work. "
"Weed.
It helped me to realize how bad tabacco is and it made going cold turkey a lot easier."
"way lat to this...  But you just have to stop..  Pick a date to quit. Smoke and enjoy your last one.  Then just stop..  Also figure out what your triggers are.  For me it was drinking, so i layed off drinking for two weeks.  Then when i started again i switched what i was drinking.  If i was a beer drinking, i drank wine now.  Or i had a vodka or scotch..  You need to want to quit though.  Thats the most important part."
"Not mine, but a family member's.
The doctor told him that each and every single cigarette in the world had enough nicotine in it to trigger an angina attack and kill him. He went from a 5 pack a day smoker to never smoking again that day."
"I went through five different models of electronic cigarettes until I found one that satisfied my craving sufficiently to let me stop. And once I found the right brand, I stopped real cigarettes in two days flat.
I'm not affiliated with any company - but in case you want to try it out, the e-juice from vapornine.com (I use crisp menthol for the throat-hit), and a cigarette from the SoCal chain VaporSpot (model iTazte VV) is what I use."
"Smoker of ten years here. I was always fortunate to be able to cold turkey when I wanted to. I was never a pack-a-day, mostly just a pack every 4 days.
What I did was I finally stopped and realized what I was doing to my body, tasted my last cigarette and came to the conclusion that it was a pointless habit. To help the cravings I bought a huge bag of Fire Jolly Ranchers and kept those in my pocket for when I had the urge. It surprisingly helped a great deal.
TL;DR cold turkey, fire jolly ranchers."
"Buproprion/zyban, the original smoking cessation drug.  I think chantix only game on the market because zyban has been a generic forever now, but it absolutely works. 
My doc gave ms zyban and said ""go ahead and keep smoking, we'll talk about how that's  going in a month"". 
I believe it works by blocking the nicotine receptors in your brain, meaning not only do you not get a nicotine buzz, but the WDs caused by open receptors aren't nearly as bad. For me it was mostly the addiction I had to fight, the chemical addiction was totally blocked by the zyban. By week 2 cigarettes stop tasting good or giving a nic rush.  By week three they were downright awful. Even when you don't think you're getting a nicotine hit, you are, it subconsciously effects you're taste of the cigarette, because sans nic, it's totally disgusting. 
Tldr; ask doc for zyban/bupropion.  It's also used as a mild antidepressant, btw. Pretty low side effect profile too, other than totally blocking nicotine.  "
Don't forget to curse Sir Walter Raleigh....stupid git. 
Set a wristwatch and one cigarette on a table next to each other. Nothing else. Stare at both. You may only put the cigarette in your mouth OR the watch on your wrist. Choose ONE. Don't leave the table until you've made a decision.
"I quit by using ecigs and reducing my nic content over time. used o$ juice for 2 months, and realized i don't need it any more. "
"I bought a nice e-cigarette as a hobby, for the novelty of smoking indoors whenever I wanted, and enjoyed it so much that I stopped craving cigarettes and practically quit without trying. So I decided to commit and never looked back. It's true that e-cigs aren't for everybody, but if it works for you like it did for me, it's totally worth it.
/r/electronic_cigarette"
"I did cold turkey. Admittedly this is not the first time. You just gotta make up your mind, quit and then give yourself no excuses and no options. After being arrested by the police and taken against my will to a non smoking jail where cigarettes are treated as a criminal offense like drugs, made me realize that I really can quit. Once you recognize your rationalization and excuses for what they are and realize that quitting is the slow walk of changing a learned human behavior you will stop wasting your time with quitting strategies and go about quitting by actually quitting before you start the internal conversation about the details and daily realities you'll face."
The love of a good woman 
"A guy, who later became my husband.  We've been married over 16 years, and I've been cigarette free for over 17.  :)"
"Personally, I quit smoking 3 or 4 times as well. I've read that relapsing makes quitting harder. Keep that in mind, but don't let it deter you. The best way to quit (without medication/doctor's visit), IS cold turkey as the top comment mentions. But adding to that, it helps to change vices along-side cold turkey. When you get a trigger, chew a toothpick, chew gum, drink a soda, eat candy or sunflower seeds. Anything that involves your mouth. A lot of the romance in smoking cigarettes comes from our oral fixation. Sounds inappropriate, but true.
If you're desperate to quit **smoking**, you can also switch to a different form of tobacco. Chewing/spitting tobacco is arguably the lesser of the two evils and could be considered the methadone of nicotine. It's easy to dismiss the idea because they're both terrible for you. Personally, at my worst, I could smoke 2 or 3 packs a day, but averaged 1 pack per day. At my worst with smokeless tobacco, I'd use 2 cans per week and on average, 1 can a week. If you've never done it before, use an unflavored tobacco and what ever is cheapest. It's disgusting and essentially tastes like dirt.
Whatever you decide, be sure to figure out how to quit your vice and good luck!"
"I just stopped thinking about it
I tried helping pieces like e-cigarette and pills but they never helped.
One day I said to myself: 'After this pack of smokes I quit' and then I just did. 
That's really all there is too it, you come to a point where you actually do WANT to quit, and only then will you be able to, if a small part of you doesn't want to quit (don't mistake this for not enjoying cigarettes anymore, I still would love to smoke one but I don't want to smoke one if you understand what I mean) then you wont make it"
"Some cunt that I worked with at a bar told me and the kitchen crew we all had absolutely no self-control, and she bet us we couldn't quit. No money or reward, just the satisfaction of the bitch eating her words. To me, that was enough satisfaction. I quit the next day and have been cigarette free for about 12 years.
So, I also believe cold turkey works, but the key is YOU have to want to quit first and foremost, as your will is going to be tested."
"Ecigs, baby. "
"I smoked from 18-26. Started off as a social smoker and before long I was a pack a day all the way through college. When I was 26 my grandfather, who was 72, was diagnosed with lung cancer. He smoked since 17 too. I was in the hospice room with my grandmother when he took his last breath. I walked outside and smoked my last cigarette. I decided I wasn't going out like that. I'm 34 now. "
"The absolute most important thing to keep in mind is that eventually the cravings will go away and it won't matter that you don't smoke.  First week was always pretty easy, but by the second week into it I'd be thinking ""this sucks, I can't live the rest of my life like this, fuck it"" and would buy a pack and be back to square one.  At some point you'll stop being a person who is quitting smoking, and just be a person who doesn't smoke.  I promise it gets easier, and once you realize that you're actually working towards a goal rather than just making yourself miserable for the rest of your life it gets exponentially easier to quit."
"I've tried everything short of prescription drugs. The gum, the patch, cold turkey. I find that everyone has their own thing that gets them to quit. For me none of those things worked. The urge to continue smoking was too great. I might make it 3 months without a smoke, then BAM I'm right back at it. Finally I go an electronic cigarette.  It gave me what I needed. I was able to ween myself off of nicotine while still enjoying the act of smoking (minus the harmful parts). I still vape today, but the juice I use contains no nicotine. I get to enjoy my bad habit without the bad."
"Cold Turkey doesn't work for me.
Only thing that works is a mixture of all the gimmicks (gum. E-cigs) AND THE SUPPORT OF YOUR COLLEAGUES/FRIENDS. Sorry for shouting, but this cannot be stressed enough. It makes all the difference in the world when someone keeps you from going outside and having that cig (because 15 minutes later, it will be ""ok"", even if chewing that stupid gum is fucking shit compared to lighting up).
Oh, and don't take any shit from non smokers. They just don't get it. As my Dr. said to me once: ""Look, rockenrohl, There's several hundred wonderful chemicals in your cigarette, and they make your brain's sinapses light up like a firework. It's not just the nicotine, you know that. It's an amazing thing, smoking... the problem is: IT HURTS YOUR LUNGS. The stupid pharma industry should investigate what's happening in a smoker's brain and come up with a safe device that does the same thing. They should have done that for *decades*, goddammit. But as these idiots *haven't*, it is my job as your doctor to tell you to quit as quickly as possible. Because you are killing yourself.""
Yes, I love my doctor. Have been off the cigs for seven months now. Still difficult when there's coffee. Still difficult when there's beer. Oh, and most difficult when there's typical triggers (some extra stuff to think about at work... I know how you feel, man). But hang in there, it can be done. Just talk to everyone there, people *will* support you. You just have to let them. You have to *want* this."
"I picked a date with meaning, told everyone about it and smoked with abandon up until that point. For me, it was the day I graduated college. I made such a big deal about both everyone externally and internalized it myself that a failure to live up to the promise really would have changed how I thought about myself as a person. Date came, still remember staying up late chain smoking.  3 days on the gum. I've never had another drag - that was 15 years ago.  Also remember thinking - statistically, you become more likely to stay a non-smoker than to revert at six months.  So that was my intermediate goal.  After that I relaxed and felt like I'd made it. Also interesting to me - I still feel like if I had one cigarette right now I'd go back to smoking. I loved that shit. "
"Be 100% committed. 
I was 28, and a 1-2 pack a day smoker. I got a cold, a really really bad one. I usually smoked through sickness, 'cause the addiction told me it makes me feel better. But this one was bad. 3 days of no smoking with the cold, I decided what the heck I'll see how long I can go - I was not at all planning on quitting. 7 days of no smoking and I was in the hospital emergency room. 
It was 3am, and I jolted awake out of a deep sleep thinking my heart had stopped. I thought for sure, this is it, I'm a gonner. My girlfriend rushed me to the ER, and I was perplexed how I was even walking since my heart felt like it was non-existent. I could not sense a heartbeat in my own chest! Why was this happening????
ER doc laid me on the table, and I was curled into a tense, tight ball. I had no idea what was going on. Doc says to me ""Do you smoke cigarettes or do cocaine?"". What a strange and precise question, I thought. I said no, never had cocaine, but that I had not had a cigarette in 7 days. He says ""You are going through withdrawal. You have a few options, start smoking again or fight it out.""
I was dumbfounded. Cigarette withdrawal??? He gave me a Xanax and I slept like a baby. 
This experience scared me out of smoking ever again, and made me feel vulnerable to addiction for the first time in my life. I went through diagnosis of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and all sorts of stuff afterwards. I had to reconcile lots of issues in my life, issues and stresses I often buried in the comfort of my cigarette addiction. It has been 6 years since I quit and I want a cigarette all the time - but its OK. I love tobacco. I love the taste, the smell, the way it feels inhaling and exhaling. I love the way it changes food and drink experiences. I allow myself to be OK with loving it all, but no longer partaking in it. I go out on smoke breaks with friends, and just enjoy the smells and the comradery. I want it, I want it bad, but I just don't need it after-all. 
Full disclosure - I do have a cigar once in a blue moon. For me, there is a psychological disconnect with cigars though - I can have one and be done for months on end. I know if I had 1 cigarette, I'd be a chimney in no time. I could also go without a cigar for the rest of my life and would not think twice about it if I had to. 
It's a personal journey. In my mind, cigarette smoking is no longer an option. There is no doubt about it for me. You have to get to that point, too, and unfortunately it is one of the most difficult and personal journeys to take. 
I will say, however, its never easy but it certainly gets easier over time. The first several weeks are the worst - especially if you are not 100% committed to it. But, if you are 100% committed, strangely, in time you just stop thinking about it. You simply stop those seemingly-autonomous reaches for the cigarette pack. As more time passes, you just feel proud of yourself. It's great.
So, in answer to your question, ""what actually worked for you?"" Being 100% committed, whatever route you take. Personally, I see E-Cigarettes as a stop-gap, allowing your brain to still identify yourself as a smoker. You have to identify yourself as a non-smoker - 100%. That is not to say you have to ""hate"" cigarettes (I LOVE them) or deny the cravings due to the addiction, but you can't allow yourself to smoke them anymore. Many people can quit cold-turkey and experienced none of the issues I did, and I wish this was true for everyone. Even still, quitting smoking was the best decision I ever made in my life. Not only for the physical health benefits, but for the mental health benefits. It forced me to create time to work on my life stressors, to listen to doctors, to care about my physical and mental health in a way I never thought about before. Cigarettes were no longer my reward system. There is no right and wrong way, this experience was as unique to me as it will be for you. Good luck, I hope you succeed in the long run!"
"If anyone has any advice on how to get past the cravings that hit you after a couple drinks, I'd love to hear it-- that has been my undoing every time. (And I really don't wanna have to quit both...) "
Slowly weaning myself down over the course of about eight months. Smoking being banned in bars helped as well.
"I got married. It was enough of a shock to the system that quitting smoking seemed easy. Rough honeymoon though. 
I had quit several time before that. Keep trying. I haven't smoked since 1980. Gum, pills, e-cigs, and all that only prolong the agony."
Will power. I woke up on Tuesday morning and decided I was not smoking anymore. Not smoked for over 2 years now.
"We found out christmas of 2012 that my grandfather had stage 4 lung cancer in both lungs. We was a heavy smoker for about 50 years but quit about 4 or 5 years before his death thanks to chantex. I was a 2 pack a dayer for about two years, so when my family heard the news they asked me to quit cigs. I quit cold turkey after i made em a promise that i wouldn't touch another cig . I occasionally smoke my pipe or a cigar, but i haven't even done either of those since my birthday this past November. It's ultimately about will power. You decide you will not smoke anymore no matter what. If you get the jitters then try taking a quick 10-20 min nap if u r able, chew gum, fidget with things, etc. when i got a new car a month after quitting i got manual transmission so my hands would be occupied, as i smoked every time i was in my car. when you get headaches coffee helps. While i would not recommend this as a method of kicking nicotine, dipping gives you the fix without the chances of lung cancer. I found it less habit forming (dipped for periods when i was a smoker) than cigarettes. Understand that it has it's risks as well, although i see them as less likely than cigarette's risks as it doesn't contain the chemicals that cigs do. Set milestones and goals for yourself. This past dec 23 i hit one year cigarette free (didn't have a cgi for a few days prior to finding out about my grandpa). Remind yourself each month that it has been another month. Tell your friends and family about your progress so that they can encourage you."
"I only allowed my self to smoke at one place, a friends house. After a while it was the only place I wanted to smoke. Then I told them to punch me if I smoked."
"I've been cigarette free for almost 3 years now but prior to that, I was a pack and a half a day smoker. 
What made me really want to quit was when I went on a hike with some friends of mine and on the way back up, I was getting so winded that we had to take several breaks so I could catch my breath. I felt so embarrassed that I was a liability.
I tried the patch several times, and the longest I lasted on those was about 4 months. While on the patch, I was avoiding potential triggers such as drinking of being around smokers. At the 4 month mark, I had 1 too many drinks and i ended up smoking again.
What I realized then was that I shouldn't avoid doing things that I used to associate smoking with(i.e. Drinking, eating, studying, taking a dump, etc) but rather, learn to do them without having a smoke. Also, I started working out the same day that I quit cold turkey, and I began to count each day as an achievement. A day became a week, then a month, then a year and so on. 
Hope that helps man, good luck!"
"Snus. Snus, snus, snus snus."
"1) Actually wanting to quit. This I think is the most important one, because without real motivation you will cheat constantly.
2) Hanging out with people who don't smoke. Less opportunities and you'll just smoke less, this is a good way to start. 
3) Consciously breaking physical habits. Smoking I think is mostly about habit, even after you shake the actual NICOTINE craving you have to shake the physical habits. For me it was the car, I would always smoke in the car. So I stopped keeping cigarettes IN the car. Things like that helped a lot, just making them less available to myself helped stave off moments of weakness.
4) Just doing it eventually. Its easier to go cold turkey if you've taken those other steps to like, break some of the not-smoking-related smoking habits. Once you no longer feel like you HAVE to have one after your morning coffee and you're no longer part of the work smoke break club, then when you go cold turkey its actually about just quitting smoking instead of changing your whole life. "
"Icy pops, that ones you put in your freezer.  And lately Blow pops.  Every time I wanted a cigarette, I had a sugary and orally fixated treat.  That is for the physical part.  
For the mental part, I started doing more cardio based exercises, and could noticable tell smoking had an impact on my lungs and performance.  So I would know I am working out on friday, so I wouldnt smoke thursday leading up to friday to increase my performance.
And not buying any packs.  I would bum them from random people, but never actually buy a pack.
Those things combined, I formed captain planet.   "
Working out and eating healthier. The lifestyle change caused it to spill over into other bad habits so I just stopped smoking.
"Take a pack of cigarettes, get the pack soaking wet. Start yelling how these things are gross. Start putting the wet cigs in your mouth. Feel how gross they are. You might throw up. This is a way to essentially scar yourself from liking cigarettes. Laugh all you want it worked for me. "
"To much time playing WoW, didn't have time to smoke. "
"I quit cold turkey. My father had a massive heart attack when he was only 42. He was very thin, athletic, and cholesterol of only 202 at the time. His only risk factor was smoking a pack a day Marlboro man. In fact, everyone in his family who smoked either died from sudden heart attacks or strokes. I put 2 and 2 together as I walked into the ER to see him near death, took his smokes, took mine, threw them in the ER trash and neither of us smoked again. I was 21 at the time and was a pack a day Marlboro man too, for about 5 years.
My father ended up needing a heart transplant 5 months later. This was back in 1988, he's still with us today doing very well. Went back to work, hasn't missed a day of work in 26 years since it happened. He never returned to smoking. His latest scans show the arteries on his new heart to be completely open and functioning perfectly. His donated heart is now 48 years old, he'll be 69 in April. The donor was 24 at the time of his death.
Thank you donor family, I think of you often.
Don't smoke. If you manage to avoid cancer and cardio diseases, you will drown in your own fluids. Also, my father's MI was on the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, A.K.A. ""the widow maker"""
"My mother has COPD already from smoking, and then came down with pneumonia. I was already considering quitting, but seeing her so sick from something preventable was terrifying... especially when I realized I started smoking at the same age she did. It was like seeing my future. After that realization, I became physically ill every time I lit a cigarette until I decided to throw away my pack. I used the electronic cigarette to keep down the horrible effects of withdrawal, and weened myself slowly off of those. I only allowed myself to use the electronic cigarette for a week, and each day I decreased the amount I used it. I've been smoke free for a month so far and have absolutely no desire to ever start back. When I get stressed, I get a sucker and use that instead. "
"Have a different break habit, like squats. Also, create a magical token that reminds you to make the right choice."
I was convinced I had erectile dysfunction cause of smoking
I went out on Mardi Gras night and got drunk and chainsmoked two or three packs. The next day I felt truly horrible and quit cold turkey.
"I quit by accident... I went out and got incredibly drunk off of margaritas and tequila shots for a friends birthday.  I had just purchased 2 'buy one get one' packs of camel Lights, So i had 4 packs on me.  I woke up the next morning with half a pack left, and the worst fucking feeling ever in my entire body.  I felt like I had been poisoned.  I tried to smoke a cig and got violently ill.  I couldnt smoke for the rest of the day.   
  
The next day all I could think about was that feeling, and the rest is history.  I have tried cigarettes since then, usually while drinking, and they are just completely tainted for me, I simply do not enjoy them anymore.  "
"Being lazy, I just decided I cbf walking to the shops any more, after 2 packs a day for 10 years lol. That and my Dad admitting to me he used to smoke 30 years ago, and he still wants a cigarette. Some things you just have to get over."
"**bupropion** (aka wellbutrin).
I've quit cold turkey, used electronic cigarettes, etc but always resumed smoking.
I used bupropion for a month and half last summer and have truly quit as a result. 
**It was an awful month.** I barely slept, had crazy dreams, was unbelievably cranky, had anxiety and a foggy head. I'm not sure how much of this was nicotine withdrawal vs. the bupropion itself, but I stopped early because I couldn't take it anymore and my senses returned to normal shortly thereafter.
I've had an occasional cigar since - and even a cigarette when I was drinking - **but honestly, it's like a switch flipped - I find them as repulsive as I did before I smoked.** There is a bit of nostalgia, from time to time, but that's the closest thing to a craving I've had in 6 months."
"Yoga. I dont mean taking 1 or 2 classes. I mean getting a real practice or routine going. Learning how to beeathe. It will releive stress and anxiety and will naturally transform your body to dislike things that arent good for you. Try yin. Try ashtanga. Find a teacher you connect with, or a studio you like and will go to regularly, or even try some youtube videos at home to get started. "
"I feel like I got lucky - either that, or I just picked the right time. 
It was my second attempt. The first time, I tried electronic cigarettes, same as you, and I couldn't do just those for long - for some reason, I needed the real thing after a while.
The second time, I tried the patch. I had just moved into a new house, and coincidentally, had just bought a new car. So a lot of my triggers were gone. I was worried about the patch, because I'd heard a lot of people were allergic to it, and I seem to be allergic to *everything*.
Despite this, I set myself up thusly - I signed up for NY's smoke-free assistance program ahead of time - they sent me free patches, enough for the first two weeks. I worked alone at the time, doing the night audit at a hotel. So I timed smoking my last pack of cigarettes so that my very last cigarette would be two hours into my shift, forcing me to go six hours without. I don't remember my logic for this, but it seemed to make sense at the time.
After my last cigarette, I put the patch on. I expected the cravings to be terrible, but the patch worked as advertised - I had a couple of small cravings, but after the first hour, I found I didn't even really want a cigarette for the rest of my shift. I was worried about how I'd sleep, but I slept like a baby. Confidence bolstered, I changed my patch religiously.
The first month was the worst of it, a lot of my friends smoked, and every time they did, I stayed inside, alone. But one by one, they started quitting too. Now there's only one or two left, and I can freely hang around them. I still occasionally get cravings, but they're extremely rare, and they go away quickly.
And I've been smoke-free for 3 years and 27 days. "
"Nicotrel.  Nothing works better.

"It's weird, but I just genuinely didn't want to anymore. I didn't feel like I HAD to quit, there was no real external pressure, I just finished a pack one day and didn't want anymore. My dad said the same thing. He was in his car in his driveway ready to go get more and just said ""nah, I don't feel like it."" And he had been smoking for decades at that point. Not really helpful because it's not exactly a method, but it is good motivation."
"A document called ""The Easy Way"" by mister Allen Carr is what helped me. Here's a link to the PDF, http://media.wix.com/ugd/74fa87_2010cc5496521431188f905b7234a829.pdf
He basically talks about how most people's approach to quitting cigarettes is fundamentally flawed and how he (a three pack a day smoker for several decades) realized one day how to change his thinking and quit for good. Give it a read, and on to happier days."
"I took part in a paid medical study focused on smoking cessation. During the study, I was given Chantix, Wellbutrin and NRT patches. They encouraged me to smoke for the first week while on the meds, but I couldn't manage more than 3 a day. When my quit date arrived, it came with ease. I stayed on the meds while not smoking for 3 months. I never got urges to smoke, even when they took me off the meds. Been clean for a long time now and it feels absolutely amazing. :)"
"I tried to quit for years. One day I just decided I was done. It may not seem like it, but there is a big difference between trying to quit, and deciding to quit. As Yoda said, ""Do or do not. There is no try."""
Making the conscious decision to stop and sticking to my decision. Kurt Vonnegut said that his smoking was a classy way to commit suicide... I don't want to die bc of smoking  
"One day I just woke up realizing how disgusting it was and the desire went away.  I still went through withdrawls but after a week i was fine and I started spitting sunflower seeds instead.  I'm now 5.5 months of being a non-smoker and couldn't be more happy about it.  It really is just about you WANTING to actually quit.  I was just driving the other day and saw a really nice car and then noticed the guy driving was smoking with the windows up, and for the first time in MY LIFE, it looked gross and trashy instead of cool and soothing.  You have to look at it differently."
"E-Cigarettes.  Not the Blu shit that you buy at gas stations, but the things you get at vape shops.  You'll have to spend a bit of money on it, but it's a good investment.
They may not work for everyone, but they've worked for me, my parents (both of which smoked for 20+ years), and multiple friends.  After making the switch, I never looked back.  "
I told my wife I was quitting. I didn't want to lie to my wife. Smoked for 15 years. It's been 11 years since I last smoked.
Fell in love with a nonsmoking girl.  That was that.
"I am very vain. I google searched old lady smokers and would look it up when I had a craving. I started to associate smoking with this lady....http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110615153803/en.futurama/images/4/40/Petunia.png

"I had the same kinds of sticky-ness issues you talk about. SUPER hard to quit. I found a couple of things out along the way that absolutely helped.
* 1) I used to smoke Camels, then Marlboro's then Merit Ultra-Lights here in the US. I found they all had different levels of nicotine that all had different affects on my cravings. The Merits were much lighter in terms of nicotine and the attendant craving. I started to smoke them and it was much easier to 'forget' to go outside for a break.
* 2) As already noted, you have to want it and be ready for the cravings and just suck it up with mints or whatever
* 3) Break your routines. I found that I was really tied to smoking in bars, and distinctly at certain specific times and places. Start by NOT having that cigarette right after you roll out of bed in the morning. When you go out for a drink, go to a non-smoking place and/or leave your smokie treats at home. The point here is to break your dependence on the rituals so that you're more comfortable walking away from cigarettes and you don't get twitchy when don't have them. Something to watch out for here is that when you do this, at first you'll find yourself standing there going ""this is when I normally go outside to smoke and now I don't know what I am supposed to do"". Have a plan to replace that smoke-break time with a trip to get a cup of coffee or something.
* 4) Reduce your need by specifically eliminating cigarettes. For example, make it a new rule to try and go all day without a smoke. Or, no smoking over the weekend or whatever. 
* 5) I am someone for whom Self-talk works. What worked for me was a daily, sometimes hourly, reminder that ""it's time to quit"". At first my inner demons fought fiercely about quitting. The anxiety around letting go was huge. And then gradually, by constantly reminding myself it was time to quit. I was able to work out in my head all the ""But what about...."" internal dialog clingy neediness BS. I don't NEED a cigarette, I have an addiction and WANT a cigarette. I need to move on now. They are holding me back.
* 6) The Zen of Smoking - You can always have a smoke, you're just not going to have one right now. When I decided to finally pull the trigger, what helped was going cold turkey but also reminding myself that if it got too bad, there was always more tobacco. No one is taking it away from me. It's right there in the store. I am just not going to have one right now. I can have one later if I need it. This reduce my anxiety a LOT.
Good Luck. You can do it.  "
"I quit cold turkey, before a 15 month tour in Iraq I decided that during the deployment I wouldnt smoke and id work out everyday (in addition to regular Army PT). I kept at it every single day and came back a changed man. Never picked up the habit again. (previous pack/day for 3 years)"
"You Say you have used electronic cigarettes, What ones? My guess is the ones you buy at Wal Mart or at 7/11. If that's true give an electronic Vaporizer a chance. Its the same thing as an electronic cigarette but way way more potent.
A good starting point in the world of vaping are the iTaste VV 3.0 and the Kanger mini Protank 2. For the ejuice to put into the tank your best bet is to visit a few of the vape shops in your town. They normally have a bar setup so you can try out their flavors, normally for free. If you need some websites for ejuice id be glad to link you to the ones I use. 
Here are ebay links to the two items i suggest. Ive ordered from this person a few times. If you dont want to order online you can get similer items at your local vape shops. Its just going to cost $10-$40 more.

"e-cigs, but it's not as easy as just buying an e-cig.  I weaned myself off of cigs while transitioning to e-cigs."
Having my first child. Never smoked again.

"I became scared shitless of the possible damage I was doing to my body, and was convinced I had cancer for a few seconds there."
"While I've never smoked, like many of us I had a lot of friends who did. There is one sure fire way to quit, that is really easy, just kind of gross.  Get a little jam/jelly jar with a tight lid, one of those about the size of a golf ball. Stuff a couple of cig butts in it, then add some water so it's about 2/3 full. Let it sit for about a week. Then, when you are ready to quit, just take it with you in your pocket/bag/purse.  Whenever you feel the urge to have a cig, take the lid off of the jar and take a big whiff of the rotten cig butt smell.  If you still want a cig after smelling that, not sure what else to tell you. I know more than a few people that have quit this way.  Also, don't ever drink it, it will supposedly kill you."
"Been smoke free since last spring, the only thing that has worked is e-cigs.  I'd given ecigs a chance twice before, and both didn't really do it for me.  On a whim, I bought a V2 express pack, and the improvements they've made in the business since the last time I'd gotten one made it doable.  Ecigs CAN work, you just need to buy the right kind.  Stay away from blu, Njoy, etc, in my opinion, they just don't yield enough vapor or give enough throat hit to quench that craving.  Give a v2 disposable a try, or order the express pack, it really can work (I don't use v2 anymore, I use bigger ""mods"" now with tanks, but v2 got me started)."
My e-cig. Never touched a cigarette ever again.
"You basically just need to keep on trying. I tried many many things, patch gum (this was before e cigs), but really when it got down to it cold turkey was the only way. You really have to want to do it, ditch all props and nicotine, it'll only prolong the process.
One thing that worked well for me was keeping track of the day that I quit, and telling myself ""you got to 2 weeks, what kind of idiot would I have to be to restart at zero again."" "
Tea tree toothpicks 
"Not a smoker here, but i think its bullshit places with ""no breaks"" make an exception for smokers.
I've only successfully gotten around that once. Only needed to once though.
Started going outside with the smokers and grabbing a coke from the vending machine. When i was questioned about it I said I was having a Coke break while they had their smoke break. Explained that caffeine can be addicting as well and successfully got my coke break."
"I was 19 (had been smoking since 16). I had $20 in my pocket, which was all of my money. I owed $20 to my uncle.
I said ""fuck it, I'll buy cigarettes and figure out a way to pay him later"" and walked down to the gas station about a mile from my house. 
When I got there I was about to open the door and go in and thought to myself, ""this is a really shitty thing to do,"" turned away, and haven't bought a pack since. (I'm 27 now)"
"I had always ""planned"" to quit when I graduated college, but I ended up doing it before that.
I did have a girlfriend who bugged me non-stop and supportive friends, but what did it was one day I decided I was going to start jogging and the pain in my chest was unbearable. I up and quit right there about 18 months ago after smoking for 5 years. Not that I haven't cheated a bummed a couple here and there since then but I haven't bought a pack since that day. 
I was up to about 10-15 a day at that point, and being a delivery driver it was highly ingrained in my work life as well. As soon as I looked at a ticket I knew immediately if I would have enough time to finish a cig before I got there. It was difficult and I still get urges to this day but overall I consider myself an ex-smoker. Being able to enjoy exercise is the thing that keeps me going strong

"My wife stopped shortly after beginning nursing school. Seeing the images of peoples lungs and then reading about the damage smoking does was enough to convince her. 
TL:DR, go to medical school of some sort. "
"I haven't had a cigarette in just over month. Honestly, dating a non-smoker was the biggest kick in the arse I needed.
There's also an app called ['Smoke Free'](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/smoke-free-stop-smoking-now./id577767592?mt=8) which I've found really useful. It's part of someone's PhD research, and tells you how much money you've saved, where your health is in relation to a non-smoker, as well as giving you daily missions to stay on track."
I used to get sinus infections and bronchitis about twice a year when I was smoking. It was miserable and breathing was painful from all the coughing (when sick). I decided to stop doing that to myself in August 2012 and haven't looked back thankfully. 
"I went cold turkey. It was the hardest thing I've had to do in my life but it was and still is the most rewarding.  For me, it was the same as pulling off a band-aid quickly.  Doing it slowly just dragged it out.  It was a living hell for me.  3 days of physical symptoms, and then mental symptoms for a hell of a lot longer than that.
My best advice?  Just friggin' do it.  It will be shitty.  But that's what a drug dependency will do to you."
"I went to my doctor asked for something to help me quit smoking and she gave me welbutrin An antidepressant that helped me quit, but everything just becomes blah, bland, and dull when your on it.
"
"In my mind, I'm still a smoker. It has been two years since I actually touched a cigarette, but I acknowledge that if I do, it will be as if I never stopped.  But I stopped suddenly - Cold Turkey.
There were a number of factors contributing - cost, social pressure, health, etc. but ultimately I stopped because I was ready to. This has been my fourth, and as of yet most successful attempt.  
There were a number of thoughts that helped fight and maintain. I kept a written journal for the earliest and hardest days. I maintained an Excel spreadsheet keeping track of how long it had been since I smoked, and used it to calculate how much I had saved at my last rate of consumption. I subsribed to the notion of NO Nicotine Ever! (NONE!) which I found when Googling the physiological effects of not smoking over time, another source of strength.  
Ultimately, no aide, no person, nothing will help you unless you are ready in your own mind to be done with it. Forever.  
Good luck! 
Edit: words"
"I quit in 2009. My husband at the time didn't smoke and didn't particularly like me smoking. I was already on anti-anxiety meds, but my psychiatrist added wellbutrin to assist with quitting. I also used those weird lozenges occasionally. I was extra bitchy for a while, but between my ex, the meds, and the lozenges it worked. 
"
"I guess this isn't really going to help you much, but here's my story.
I was all set and ready to quit for the umpteenth time, got myself an e-cigarette to use that to help. Had my good reasons, health, money, etc. All reasons I'd used to quit before. I'd used Nicorette gum before, too, which helped me quit for my longest previous stretch of no-smoking which was 6 months. 
So yeah, I was all set for another round of quitting--armed with an e-cig this time, so surely it'll work! Then I had to have two wisdom teeth removed. Was in too much pain to even think about cigarettes for awhile, then the idea of smoking with two healing holes in my head turned me off, and the whole idea of smoking at all just seemed gross. I've now quit for almost a year, my longest stretch yet, and the whole idea is still nauseating to me. "
"I am a longtime lurker here.  I created an account just to answer this question.  I was a 2-pack-a-day smoker for 17 years and have now been smoke free for 7 years.  After many failed attempts, my success hinged on a 2 part strategy-one physical the other mental.
My physical strategy was to separate the chemical addiction from the mental addiction so I could fight the battles separately.  It is hard enough to give up the social aspect of going out to smoke with your buds and having a smoke while driving, drinking, or right after eating.  This strategy used nicotine replacement therapy.  I used the lowest dose nicotine patch I could find (the ""step 3"" patch of the most popular brand) to give me a slow constant feed of nicotine all day.  I supplemented with the lower dose nicotine gum when I got those strong, out of the blue cravings.  This allowed me time to figure out how to cope with the change of habit, etc.  After I was comfortable as a non-smoker (several months), I got rid of the patch first but kept the gum to handle the urges that swing by and assault you randomly.  I then started slowly transitioning from nicotine gum to regular chewing gum by increasingly choosing a piece of regular gum over nicotine gum.  After a while, I was just chewing regular gum.  I was a half-pack-per-day gum chewer for a while, but at least it was a healthier habit.
The mental aspect was more important than the physical, I think.  The predominant think here was a shift in perspective.  I had always made excuses about my failure to quit or why I could not quit now.  There was always some life stressor that was my crutch.  ""I can't quit because XYZ is stressing me out and I can't handle quitting at the same time"".  The perspective change was to look at all of those stressors (my Mom being diagnosed with dementia, new job, family troubles,financial stresses, etc) and decide to change my tune.  I started telling myself ""If I can handle all of these things, surely I can handle quitting smoking"".  In one sentence, you are flipping your excuse around and deciding that instead of allowing the stresses in your life to control you, you will use them as a source of strength in the battle against smoking.  This statement became my ""mantra"" during my battle with nicotine. I feel this was truly the weapon that helped me succeed. It wasn't until I hit my first year smoke free that I truly felt victorious.
Hang in there, good luck, and I hope this helps.
TLDR - nicotine replacement therapy and major attitude adjustment"
"Cold Turkey, with some lifestyle changes worked for me. I'll be 15 years on 2/5. I started a new job and moved into a new place with a non-smoking roomie. That really helped. Also, every night after work I'd stand out on the deck and smoke a big, fat joint. That helped too I believe. Good Luck!"
"I think your success just depends on what motivation you've got. Telling myself that I would get cancer did nothing. Thinking about wrinkles, nothing. How it smelled bad and how my coworkers disdained the habit, nothing. 
Now, insurance company coming down on me like a ton of bricks did the trick. I am fairly frugal and didnt want to pay the extra premiums, higher deductibles, etc. So I started by gradually cutting back. I stopped going inside gas stations, for any reason. I paid outside and stayed away from the temptation of buying them. 
The first three days of 0 cigs sucked. After the crankiness wore off I started to gradually feel better. I had cravings for years though, and I still will smoke if I get drunk. Luckily, I'm not a drinker, so that maybe means once or twice a year I smoke one or two cigs. 
I'm glad I quit, but there have been some side effects from smoking that havent gone away after. Overall, I do feel better. I don't run out of breath as easily and my sense of smell came back a little bit. Not a lot though. I smell more than my still smoking husband, but I dont think it will ever go back to being what it was. 
I also have become very prone to migraines from scents since I quit. Perfume, scented candles, and cigarette smoke in particular trigger them. I never had them while I smoked. I'm not sure why I became more sensitive. "
"Worked in an office and smoked about 10 to 15 through a work day. Then a guy moved into the space opposite me who smoked nearer forty a day. Every time he lit up, he passed one to me and I had to return the favour. After a week I was buying 2 packs a day. I simply stopped overnight as I was just suddenly sick of everything about them. Not one since. That was 1984, 30 years ago. So glad I did, I felt the benefits within days. Larry the lung as we called him, passed away a few years ago. Nice guy."
"You have to stop seeing yourself as a ""smoker."" I smoked for 8.5 years and tried to quit 4-5 times, once made it almost 6 months. But each failed attempt I was just thinking of myself as a smoker who wasn't smoking. It wasn't until I decided I was no longer a smoker that everything changed. If you're not a smoker, you don't smoke. It's about how you define yourself."
"Cold turkey worked for me. But instead of just quitting one day, I set a date like two months away and designated that my quit date. I wrote in on the calendar what changes were taking place. For example, the improvements that have been made to your body within 1 day or 2 weeks etc after the last cigarette. I bought a ton of chewing gum and had it ready for my quit date and I pulled out one cigarette and set it aside for the night before. 
The night before my quit date, I smoked the last cigarette and went to bed trying to focus on what changes and improvements were being made in my body with each hour, day, week etc. Every time I wanted a smoke I tried to focus. ""If I can make it one more day, then my risk of heart attack has decreased by x%"" and I'd chew gum. Lots of gum. I also put away the money I saved each day from not buying cigs. I used it to reward myself with something like a video game or whatever thing it was that I wanted. Maybe a dinner at a nice restaurant. Sometimes I bought lottery tickets. So there was additional motivation there. 
The biggest motivation of all of it was my friends. One of the hardest things about quitting is always being around other people that smoke. I had the advantage of having a lot of friends that were non smokers. They were very supportive and seemed to stay involved and interested in my progress. I quit Apr 10, 2004. So I'm coming up on 10 years. I have wanted cigarettes. I still want cigarettes. I sometimes dream about smoking and have this feeling if relief of having a cigarette and guilt for giving in. But I've come this far. I feel like I'd have to erase all the progress from my calendar if I had another cig today."
For me it was just not being around it and quitting cold turkey. If I needed to smoke a cig I would find something to do like eat a bag of chips. It's helpful and eventually you won't even think about it.
I was able to just stop plus I was getting sick a lot so that helped me kick the habbit
I just stopped.
"Marijuana.  [There is even evidence to show that it can be used to treat addiction to harder drugs.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24069004)
My wife and I smoked 3 packs a day (each) and tried quitting several times without success.  What finally worked was rolling about 20 joints and smoking those instead over a period of about 3 weeks.  In hindsight it really helped with the anxiety, aggression, and feelings of insanity that came with trying to quit.  I could not have done it without Marijuana.
It took around 3 weeks for the daily urge to jump out the window and violently snatch a cigarette out of some strangers mouth to subside.  Six months after that and I was not even thinking about smoking that often at all, perhaps even going a few days without thinking about it.
It is now 15 years later and I have not had one cigarette, but I still always want one.  I will want one until the day that I die.  The reason I don't have one is because quitting was too hard to do again.  The difference is that these urges are muted and easy to ignore now.
If you have not heard of [Ibogaine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibogaine) then take a look.  It is a drug that can cure any addiction, sometimes with a single dose.  It is for real and you can only get it in Mexico or places outside of the US.  I hope one day to get my hands on some so I will no longer have even the slightest desire for a cigarette. 
"
You have to break the habit somehow but it will never entirely go away.  I smoked only at work so instead of going out and smoking I either read a book or messed around on my phone or ate.  Using that I was able to break the routine and establish a different one that didn't involve smoking.
"I completely ignored the daily dosage limits on those lozenges.  If I wanted a puff, I would pop out a lozenge and suck away.  If I wanted a puff an hour later, I would have one.  I also ignored the official schedule for tapering down.  After a week I noticed that I reached for them less often.  It probably took about 2 months total."
I used the gum. I'd pop a piece whenever I felt like a smoke. I also avoided drinking for a month or two... Nothing goes with a beer like a cigarette. I've been smoke free for 11 years.
"I succeeded by using Nicotine lozenges. Whenever I had the urge to smoke, I'd pop one in and it not only satisfied my craving but also the oral fixation that can occur with smoking."
"I quit cold turkey, I feel it's still the best and quickest way to quit smoking for good. Sure the next few days will be shit but just keep thinking of the long run. 7 months smoke free and I can now wake up in the morning without coughing up a lung or spitting out that nasty morning gunk. I can also last a lot longer on runs/ long walks, I plan on running in this years toronto half marathon! Good luck in your journey of quitting, it'll be the best decision of your life."
"I was purchasing a house. Mortgage officer said he needed me to find another 200$ a month.  Mission accomplished.  I quit cold turkey, if you have the right motivation, should be fairly simple assuming that motivation is important to you. Good luck... Oh and there was a quit counter website that made me feel better about my decision to quit... Kept track of money saved, smoke free breaths to date.  "
"Cold turkey worked for me eventually but I also did some things leading up to quitting that might have made the transition a little easier:
Only smoked outside
No smoking at work
No smoking in the car
I went from a pack a day to less than a pack a week.  I did that for a year or so and finally said WTF am I doing and quit."
"First thing is that you really have to want to quit.  After 10 years of a pack and a half a day, and a six month old daughter I wanted to quit.
I used the 21mg nicotine patch, then after two weeks stepped down to the 14mg patch.  A week into it, I forgot to wear my patch one day.  I didn't notice until lunch.  No more patches after that.  During my quit cycle I ""smoked"" cinnamon sticks.  I still do this today, 7 years later."
"e-cigs, but the more advanced setups like egos clearomizers, not the gas-station e-cigs.  Then quickly moved into rebuilds like a provari-igo set up, that gave me something to fiddle with.  Then I discovered tobacco flavors (not really the same taste as smoking - but better) - sealed it for me - never going back to smokes.
Smoke free 5 months now - no desire to go back what-so-ever. "
"For me, cold turkey was the only successful approach.  I tried patches, gum, and e-cigarettes, and none of them worked.  Prepare yourself for about 10-14 days of feeling really crappy and pissed off.  But after that, you will feel soooo much better.  It's been almost 15 months since I quit, and I have no intention of ever starting again."
I gave myself asthma. Now when I have even half a cigarette I start wheezing an hour later. No more cigarettes. 
"I would say learn from your mistakes. did you try to quit 5 times the same way and fail each time? then don't do that again! Get help from others, ask for their support, go to the doctor and try Chantix, maybe?
For me, the only thing that worked was quitting drinking and smoking pot as well. i was/am an addict, and quitting those drugs was hard. I knew it was going to be hard, so i figured, why not just quit smoking at the same time? its already going to suck...might as well...
I tried quitting smoking several times before, but i always bummed cigs when drunk or high. 
So that's what worked for me. Good luck!"
"I smoked 2-3 pack during a night (and drink a lot of everything). The next day was spent with vomiting, but after that I really did not wish to smoke for a few days. As usually the first days were the hardest (I also had a few attempts), the above was a big help for me."
I had a stop smoking buddy (we both decided to quit cold turkey in July 2011) which made it easier to hold myself accountable. 
One of my older friends from work for the last 7 years passed away from lung cancer two weeks ago. I no longer smoke
"I just decided that I wouldn't buy anymore. It worked. I actually didn't want to, and I think cigarettes taste solo good, but I have horrible allergies and like to run 10k a couple times a week, and when the summer was coming up last spring I had so much difficult breathing already without the smoking, so I just quit because I wanted to be able to run better :)
First 24h was difficult, because i had a hard work evening then, and liked to hop out for a nerve cigg while working, but after that first day it was all fine. "
"I had an evil and persistent cough for months which I thought had to be emphysema or lung cancer. After much self-inflicted misery believing I was dying I eventually went to the doctor who prescribed a simple course of antibiotics which cured me within a week.
It left me with the thought ""What if it *had* been cancer?"", which in turn made me realise I didn't want to smoke any more. 
Allan Carr's EasyWay book helped enormously, as did taking up the guitar (new hobby that gives your hands something to do)."
"I got the flu,  it hit hard,  I was bed ridden for 5 days.  When I got better I did not crave a cigarette.  Smoke free 6 years.  Get the flu,  break the habit!"
"Smoker of 13 years. I started at 16, now im 29. March will be 1 year smoke free.
I started with the Blu E-cig. I used this for about a month. One of the redditors over at ecigs works for blu and sent me a bunch of cartridges for promoting the blu ecig. It did wonders, although  I always had it in my mouth. AT work, at home, in the car, at hockey, in the locker room, it never left, because, well I could use it anywhere, and you dont realize how long your puffing away.
Slowly I started to time myself to other people. When they lit up, i pulled out my blu, when they tossed their butt, I put my blu away. same at work on smoke breaks. Eventually it got colder outside and I said fuck it, ill just do my smoke break at my desk
after about a month, I ran out of menthol cartridges. I had to order more, with the free points I got from a redditor. The cartridges I got, tasted like burning rubber. Absolute shit, to the point I was gagging and felt nausea from using them.  That was it. I tossed my blu back in the box, and in the center console it went.  That was the final straw.   From then on, I was smoke free. I went from april, till about june, when a friend offered me a drag of his smoke while were drunk in Atlantic City. I said sure lets see what happens, and I took a drag. Man that tasted like pure shit , I was gagging, hacking, i looked like a beginner on his first cigarette. Thats when I realized, i was happy I quit. I then turned most of my friends over and they all vape now.
I only use a vape for trees , but im glad im smoke free now. I feel better, although, the smell of 2nd hand smoke makes me gag, and I hate coming home from a night of poker and stinking like an ash tray, only now I can actually smell the difference between clean clothes, and clothes covered in smoke. I have to immediately through them in the wash when I get home so the house doesnt stink of stale smoke (to me)
not to mention. the amount of $$$$ i have saved, and put towards gas instead in my damn Hemi "
"First thing, the FIRST thing is super simple and is also the most important step; you have to decide how badly you HATE the habit. This is ESSENTIAL to having a successful quit. You can't kinda want to quit; it has to be firmly planted in your heart of hearts that you are disgusted with smoking. Also, cold turkey is your best bet statistically. something to the tune of +90th percentile of the permanent quitters are cold turkey quitters.
You have to have a solid support system around you. You need to be in a circle of other people who are doing the same and its important that you keep track and keep each other accountable. This can mean therapy, it can mean forums/support groups etc. For me, it was as simple as using the Livestrong app for about 2 weeks while I was fighting the 72 hours (nicotine leaves your body after 3 days!!) of legit cravings and the next several days after that fighting the mental cues. I had to log how many I smoked (0) and how many I craved (on average, 12 a day). 
I wont lie, it took a lot of focus and I had to take time from work for the first 3 days so I could sweat it out. I put my headphones on (I listened to Metallica's symphony version of ""Sad But True"" a lot), stayed on the app while I watched TV and I soldiered through every single craving. It was rough those first 3 days. I kid you not though, after that little period passed, the cravings began to feel like mini orgasms. I'd get that weird rush up my chest and I started to ENJOY the cravings, rather than fight them. My brain was making like it was caressing the sensations little by little until they became no more. I was able to drink alcohol, coffee and eat a meal and I could leave without need of a nic fix. It was beautiful, man.
 Its been over a year now since my last cigarette. Cold turkey, no e-cig, no patch or gum. You can do it.
"
"Chantix/Champix.  
My wife and I both smoked, which made it hard to quit.  If we tried to do it separately, the Quitter was always exposed to the smoke of the non-Quitter.  We tried to do it simultaneously once, and it was....rough.
So I decided to go alone and got a prescription for Chantix.  Not going to lie, this drug messes you up. The nausea/stomach problems were difficult at first, but seemed responsive to antacids.  The dreams were extremely vivid, and sometimes I would bolt out of bed due to nightmares.  But it worked, and     seemed to hit the ""off"" switch for any cravings or positive associations with smoking.
After a few weeks, I couldn't stand the sight/smell of cigarettes. And then being married to a non-smoker really motivated my wife.  She wasn't eligible for the drug, so used the patch and gum.  It took her much longer, almost a year, before she stopped ""slipping,"" but she's good now as well.
This weekend will be my 3 year anniversary as a non-smoker.  I still think about cigarettes occasionally, and even have a ""fond memory"" (not really a craving) once in a while, especially if I see smoking in movies.  But sometimes I pass a doorway to a building, or chat with someone in an office or elevator, and you can instantly tell they smoke, and it is nauseating.  I'm not judging them, but I do think the drug re-wired my brain to be repulsed by cigarettes."
"I used the same trick I use when I go by the candy isle, just say no to myself.
It might sound easy, but it took me alot of dedication to listen to my own no, but looking back at the hard times, I am really happy that I have learned to listen to myself."
"I wanted to quit.  I think that was the most important aspect.  I had been smoking since 17 and I had quit several times but relapsed because I didn't really feel the need or desire to quit.
Fast forward to my mid-20's.  I am dating a non-smoker and all of her friends are non-smokers.  I knew that she hated it when I smoked because she could smell it in my breath for days afterwards.  She didn't like kissing me or being that close to me after I had smoked, so I knew that if I smoked, I sacrificed physical intimacy.
I wanted to quit anyways.  I was hanging around a lot of non-smokers.  I was drinking less.  It happened naturally.
Now I have completely quit smoking for over a year.  I smoke when I drink heavily with smokers, but that happens every once in a few months.  I removed myself from these situations and I don't hang around smokers' circles.
tl;dr you have to want to quit and it helps to not hang around smokers or engage in habits that make you want to smoke."
"
Everytime I wanted a cigarette i reminded myself that I didn't and told myself having a cigarette was a stupid idea because they are disgusting.
The important thing is you really have to WANT to quit. Thinking you should quit is no use. And you really need to avoid triggers for the first week, while the idea gets stuck in your head.
The important thing is to find a focal point in time as to when to start. Use a time that is important to you."
"The money.  Cigs are expensive as hell in MA, and I was wasting too much money on them."
"After about a decade, I successfully quit using 2 simple items;  Sugar free lifesavers and wooden toothpicks (plastic ones can and will shatter in your mouth).
When a craving would come up, I pull out a toothpick and start chewing away.  If the craving got worse, I would start popping a few lifesavers.  I know it sounds simple, but It worked for me."
"I chewed the gum.
For like 3 years.
Then I went cold turkey on the gum and chewed normal gum like it was the only thing keeping me alive for like 6 months.
Now I'm done chain-chewing non-nicotine gum.
You never stop wanting to smoke, despite what anyone tells you. It's always there, lurking.
The trick is to not be a little bitch. If you want to not smoke, stop smoking. "
" I smoked from the age of 16 till 30ish maybe a bit before. I was also close to having a kid but i knew i wanted to quit before i found out. I had said i wanted to quit many times before but only half meant it.  Honestly the thing that worked best for me was actually wanting to quit in  the very core of my soul as well as a small book called The Easy Way to Quit smoking by Allen Carr. This book was amazing. its not long or hard to read and it even encourages you to smoke while reading it. this helped both me and my wife quit smoking. I haven't had one cigarette since and look back on all the money and effects that it may have caused to my health and am appalled that i ever did it for so long. 
P.s cold turkey is the way to go dont use patches or gums or pills imo. Only you can tell if you are ready and serious about it"
"I quit about four years ago, and I occasionally still get cravings if I'm too idle. I carry a thing of nicotine lozenges, so I'm not technically 100% habit free, but I'm tobacco free."
"I had tried to quit about 10 times before with patches, gum, and even hypnosis.  I just wasn't ready to quit I think.  Then I tried Chantix.  This drug was the worst.  While I didn't feel like smoking I also couldn't sleep or take a crap.  The little amount of time I did sleep I would have crazy dreams that would wake me up.  Actually, saying crazy dreams is an understatement.  Dreams like me, riding a flying Polar Bear naked while fighting daemons with a sword made of paper in a land made of Rock Candy.  The dreams were so vivid and real.  I was always irritable and I was afraid it was going to get worse.  Anyway, after about two weeks of this I had to stop taking it.   After going through that, I decided that cold turkey would be the way to go.  No E-Cigs, No quit aids because those just put nicotine back in my body.  I actually wanted to quit, which was a big factor for me.  ItÛªs been a little over 400 days now.  I have no desire to smoke and I am happy that I do not spend the money I used to spend on something that gave me very little happiness and eventually was going to kill me.   I also had to quit drinking while I quit smoking.  They went hand and hand for me.  So to make sure I gave myself the best chance possible I quit drinking for about year. Maybe itÛªs a little soon to say I have ÛÏquitÛ smoking, so IÛªm a smoker who hasnÛªt had a cigarette in over a year.  The hardest thing for me was what to do with my handsÛ?I chew straws now.  It sort of looks like I devolved a coke habit because there are also cut up straws around me. 
TL;DR: Really do some research if you are thinking about taking Chantix.  I personally think you have to want to quit to be successful.  Try cold turkey first, you can do it.
"
"The main reason why I quit is because I wanted to be healthy, at the time I was going to the gym more, eating good & working hard to achieve my goals. I figured there is no way that smoking is helping me at all in goals to get fit & healthy. I read a lot that when you quit smoking that you usually gain about 10 pounds or more because smoking suppresses your appetite & it did, I noticed pretty quickly that I was getting hungrier quicker. 
Well I smoked my last cig one night after I left the gym. I still had half a pack left, I figured cold turkey was the ONLY way to go cause I wanted out of the bad habit! I even kept the half a pack in my jeep, maybe to tempt my self I don't really know but after 2 weeks I crushed the pack up in my hand & in the trash they went. I've been quit for close to 4 years now.
Oh and it also saves a lot of money, smoke a carton a week, in Kentucky that's $45 a week. "
"my dad smoked 4 packs a week for about 30 years, then one day he woke up sick with the flu.  He went outside to have a cigarette, but what with being sick it gave him just the worst taste in his mouth, so he couldn't smoke while he was sick.  When he got better, he tried to light one up, but that taste immediately came back.  he never could smoke again after that."
Force yourself to smoke when you are sick and have no desire to smoke. It will taste so bad and make you want to puke and it made me never want to smoke another oneÛ?..unless I'm drunk
"My Dad smoked for forty years. Started when he worked at a hospital, and it only got worse when he started working on oil rigs. He was a two pack a day smoker at his worst. He used e-cigarettes to kill the really bad urges, and slowly killed off the habit. Hes been smoke free for six months now."
"Next time you get really sick, take full advantage of it! I developed a really bad bronchial infection. later my Dr would tell me that if he had known how bad, I would have been hospitalized. Funny thing about being really sick is that it prevents you from feeling hungry, thirsty, or much of anything else. It also prevents you from acting on pangs or impulses even if you had them. The only actions I could manage voluntarily were: bed -> bathroom -> couch and variations there of. On about the third day of being feverish and miserable, I realized that I had not had a cigarette for three days.  I had always heard that the third day was the hardest and if you could get past it, then you had about a 50/50 chance at being successful. Also, as I lay there drowning in my own fluids, I realized that this is what it would be like to die from some form of lung disease. You're in a constant state of panic because you can barely breathe. Not fun. So there I was; half alive but wanting to take advantage of the silver lining this illness had brought me. I took my last pack and buried it at the bottom of the trash can. I then began to assemble the most horrendous collection of garbage a sick man could accumulate to pile on top of it. If I was going to give in, I would have to dig through that nightmare. Believe me, I would never have made it. It's eight years on now smoke free. I was a pack a day smoker for twelve years prior to that week-and-a-half of hellish deliverance."
"E cigarettes did the trick for me. Admittedly I was only an occasional smoker, but if I was drinking it was almost necessary. I bought an ego twist and mini vivi nova and haven't looked back since. Been about 8 months now, haven't touched a cigarette.   "
"It was easy for me so I can't help
Someone asked me one day why I smoked, hen I failed to come up with a reason, I threw the cigs I had on me away and never smoked again. 
I can say, when someone asks you if you want a smoke, don't reply ""I'm trying to quit""
Instead say ""no, I don't smoke.""
That simple change will drastically change how both other people and you view you. "
"Cold turkey and persistence.
Edit. I want to add that it also took me sacrificing my body.  When I was young I felt no real ill health effects from smoking for the first 10 years of smoking.  But as the years creeped on my health very slowly eroded that I just adjusted to every new low.  Short of breath and overweight was not a sudden state of being, it took the last 10 years to become how I am.  During this 10 years I tried to quit, but every time I did my health returned, I would smoke a casual cigarette at a bar, then over next month I would inevitable start smoking again.  This cycle continued for 10 years, until it came to the point where I was wheezing and short of breath all the time.  If I did manage to quit for 2 months, the wheezing and shortness of breath stayed.  My blood pressure was high and I could feel my face and neck throb while at rest, my heart rate was always high.  I've quit smoking for over 4 months (my longest stretch), I'm always a little short of breath, I really feel that it has taken a toll on my body."
"Every time you crave a smoke, jug a cup of warm water"
"hear me out on this one, do dip or pouches to ease out of the habit of smoking. Your still getting a nicotine fix, but after a month or two, youll have broken your habit of actually smoking cigarettes, plus a tin only cost 3$, lasts like a week, and is alot easier to quit. once you feel you have no desire to smoke, just tamper off of the dip. i havnt had a single cig in like 2 months, and after 2 months of dipping i went from 5-7 lips a day to only 2 or 3 and then i stopped. I Found this method really easy, because doing dip as you can imagine is alot more of a hassle and nastier than smoking cigs, making it much easier to quit."
Vape. :)
"I just stopped one day. I tried quitting a bunch, but I took three days off from work and that was it."
"Switching to pipes.
No, seriously.  I was almost up to a pack a day and in the middle of being unemployed.  I started smoking a pipe (because I grew up around my dad smoking a pipe, my grandfather smoked a pipe, and I *loved* the smell of it) and learned a few things about smoking pipes:
* there are a lot of rules  
* a lot of rules = inconvenient for chain smoking (light up more than once every few hours?  ha!)  
* there are a *lot* of rules  
* Pipe smoke smells 1000x better than it tastes (which is still better than cigs, but come on)  
* seriously, have I mentioned how many rules?
And I just.. kind of stopped one day.  I've still got like five pipes and a ton of tobacco because my dad's thrilled that we have something to connect over, and I don't have the heart to tell him that I've quit.  I get a craving for a cig every now and then when my stress levels really spike, but I haven't smoked in months.
I know it's kind of unusual, but hey, if it works, right?  Hope this helps, OP."
"Hey there I'm super late to the party here. Like a lot of people on here I quit smoking cold turkey July 2 2011. I did 3 things I went on a vacation for ten days, there was no triggers at all. When I came back I moved, again the normal triggers were gone,  third I told my wife to support me, and she did- we didn't drink and avoided triggers. Worked great for me. 
My mother and brother Inlaw both quit using chantix. I have heard great things about it. It stops your craving and make them taste bad. You could maybe try that?!"
Cold Turkey was the only thing that helped me.
"The only thing that worked for me was when my dad had a heart attack. He had 3 stents put in and is perfectly fine, but the whole thing really scared me. He smokes and heart disease ruins in the family. I realized that I do not want to have a heart attack in my fifties so I quit cold turkey. Feels great."
"Honestly, I just got away from everything. Went on vacation, away from my friends that were smokers, and didn't take any cigarettes with me. One week later I was back home and wasn't smoking. Now believe me, there have been times where I've been dying for one, but when I tried again it was awful and didn't want to keep going.
Tldr: smoked for 6 years, quit in one week."
"Mass Effect 3. Ok, actually it was game planning on how to keep me away from my smoking hot spots while I got over the chemical addiction. 
Work and my car were the two main places I did most of my smoking. I set up to take 3 days off work (wed-fri) to have a 5 day weekend. This was planned for the week that Mass Effect 3 was released. I also prepped by purchasing some tootsie pops and grabbing a handful of McDonald's straws. So for 5 days I pretty much didn't leave my house. I played ME3, chewed straws, ate suckers, and suffered through the withdrawals.
You just need to realize that smoking is a chemical and habitual addiction. It takes time for the nicotine to leave your body and it takes time for you to not have your smoking hot spots.

Hypnosis.  No Fear.
"I bought an oz of kush and locked myself inside with zelda the windwaker, only going out for the grocery store and 3 hrs of walking every day.  After 2 wks I had broken the habit."
"7 months w/o a cig at this point. Using an e-cig. Is it better than patches, gum, mints ect? I think so. But what I attribute my success to is the frame of mind I took on when I quit. I said to myself - I know this is going to be hard but I don't want to be afraid to let this friend/crutch go anymore. It's not who I am or want to be anymore. Cold turkey is not for everyone, no matter what everyone says about it being the way. You can quit, however you want to quit...if you really want to quit.
Edit: smoker 26/42 years"
"I smoked for 8 years. I equally loved it and hated it. I agree with everyone saying cold turkey is the way to go. It was the only thing that worked for me. The gum and patches did nothing but give an itty bitty buzz. What I really craved was the process of putting a cigarette up to my lips and taking a long drag. 
I also became super aware of what triggered my cravings. It was habit to smoke in the car or whenever I talked on the phone. And it was very hard to not buy a pack after a long phone conversation, or driving to work, etc... 
The first week, it was all I could think about. But you have to deal with that day's cravings only. Only focus on the day you're currently living, and you can get through it. I guess that could be said about nearly any problem."
"Bladder cancer.. was given a choice.. a lifetime of cytoscopes, surgeries through the natural port to the bladder and dumping chemo.. or quit smoking

"I quit cold turkey with training for a half marathon as my motivator. The hardest part for me was the behavioral triggers, drinking and smoking, coffee and smoking, driving and smoking... you get the picture.
It wasn't until I started running about 3 miles in a single clip that I realized smoking was doing serious harm to my time and ability. I know it's an ""Oh duh!"" moment, but still, if it wasn't for wanting to run a half marathon at a respectable time, I wouldn't have quit.
It sounds silly to say, but it really is day by clawing day. I got to two days without a smoke, and it felt good to be that far, then I got to a week, and I knew that if I lit up, I would have to go back to 0 days of not smoking. Once the time starts piling up, you will want to keep gaining days of not smoking, and when you think about smoking, you instead look at it from is giving up the 880 days that I haven't smoked worth having a cigarette? No. No it is not.
A note on the behavioral part: I joke about this, but this is really how I overcame the drinking alcohol and smoking relationship. I quit cold turkey, then I would get drunk as fast as possible and then go to sleep early. This way I quickly tried to train myself to know there are times you have drank but not smoked, and it wasn't so bad. It probably is ill-advised to do this, but hey, it worked to get me over the hump of having a drink and a smoke."
"This will probably never see the light of day, but the only true answer is willpower.  Quitting smoking is a testament to how strong your will is.  I was a smoker for over 10 years, so quitting wasn't easy for me.  I don't care what the 20 year smokers say, I believe I would have had an equally difficult time quitting then.  I tried the electronic cigarette, but it only made me crave regular cigarettes and gave me nightmares (too much nicotine).  3 days before my 30th birthday, I told my fiance that I always convinced myself that I would quit smoking before I was 30.  She proceeded to take my cigarette pack, and rip up the contents.  It was just the ""shove"" that I needed.  It motivated me to not only stop smoking, but completely change my entire life-style.  Honestly, you don't realize how miserable the entire ordeal is without exercising.  And believe me, as much as I loved smoking, I loved to not exercise.  Now my perspective couldn't be any different.  I actually enjoy working out, and I couldn't fathom having another cigarette.  I have been smoke free for 536 days.  The smell disgusts me.  But I won't allow myself to become a snob about it.  I'm at the point where cravings are now very rare.  I found that the first year was the most difficult.  The idea of experiencing every day on the calendar year without a cigarette, was actually frightening to me at one point in time!  But for a good reason though.  Afterall, close to 15 years prior I had been experiencing every moment in my life with a cigarette either in my hand or in my mouth.  That was the thought that provoked me seeing quitting smoking as a life style change.  And I might as well take better care of my health completely!  I began exercising/running, eating healthier, even taking better care of my teeth!  It all goes hand in hand.  Quitting smoking is a lifestyle change.  And the only thing that can get you through it is having the willpower to acknowledge that and live accordingly.    "
I should also add that I've gained about thirty pounds since then. Make of that what you will.

"Believe it or not, I quit Drinking, smoking and caffeine all within a couple weeks. 
First up was Drinking. I read the Alan Carr book ""The EasyWay to stop drinking,"" Jason Vales book ""Kick The Drink Easily,"" and ""The Alcohol lied to me"" by Craig Beck. They are all the same message and philosophy regarding stopping drinking forever and same philosophy on breaking addiction in general.
From there, I read ""The Easyway to quit smoking"" by Alan Carr. Again, same method, just applied to smoking.
Then I quit caffeine on my own by applying the same method.
All since New Years and haven't looked back.
Edit: In case it hasn't already been recommended,  /r/stopsmoking/ is very supportive."
"Chantix for two weeks, Wellbutrin for a year. Believe it or not the medication really helped. I smoked for 15 years prior to quitting. Also pick a date to quit and stick to it. If you fail, don't get upset and start smoking again, just stick to it. Don't let one slip ruin what is a great life change!"
"Poverty.
I was to the point where I could only afford maybe 1 pack a week unless I had some coupons. I'd smoke half the pack the first day and then try to make the rest last as long as I could. I I'd roll up the butts and everything. I decided to switch to cigarillos, and only when I was drinking. I started smoking weed around this time and stopped drinking so much so my need for tobacco to go with my beer went away, couple months later I couldn't stand the shit. That was about 2 years ago."
"Nicoderm patch plus nicotine gum when I got bad cravings.
After about 2 or 3 weeks, didn't need the gum anymore.
Rode the patch out to the end of the 3-step treatment and haven't smoked since."
Had to stop drinking for the first month. Drinking and smoking are so closely related it's too strong a trigger.
"No sap story here: Schedule your cigarette breaks, then take one away per week until you reach 0. Just set the times you smoke and set a number of cigarettes, then reduce the times and amounts accordingly. This will put your body on a scheduled system of gratification (which is less addictive, see Skinner box) and you'll be free. Worked for my mom and it worked for me. 
Also, don't bring your cigs to a party or bar and stick to your smoke breaks like religion. For example, your afternoon smoke needs to be at a specific time and you only have 1 or 2, then as you progress you can get rid of that break and just have your after-dinner smoke. 
I smoked throughout my late teens to mid 20s and I have touched a cig in over two years nor have I had a craving. "
Will power. If you want to it's not hard. If you think you should quit it's not the same as wanting to abd you will probably fail.
"Rock climbing helped me cut back alot, I got down to mostly bumming them at bars and buying maybe a pack a month. One day I mentioned I had only had about 6 in a month and a friend said ""dude your not a smoker if you've only had 6."". It really helped me bury that side of my personality and by not considering myself a smoker buying a pack doesn't feel normal anymore. I'll still have one occasionally when I drink but it's no longer some nagging shameful thing in the back of my head."
"I wanted to. 
Seriously, thats it. If you WANT to quit, you will. Thats it. All this ""Oh I need Nicotine patches, or gum, oh I think Ill use a vape pen for a while so I can still spend time and money ensuring that I have a supply of Nicotine that I can inhale on a regular basis while pretending I am not"" is a bunch of bullshit. If you want to quit, you will. If you dont, youre going to pussyfoot around, ""taper off"", switch to a vape, etc. 
All you need is the desire to quit. Chewing gum and Sunflower seeds will make it easier, but if the desire to quit is truly there, you will. 
Source: Smoked 1/2 ounce of rolling tobacco and 1/4 ounce of weed daily for about 3 years. Quit on willpower alone. "
How in the hell did you not only afford the weed but your lungs continue to work after your weed/tobacco Olympics? 
"I had a major bug that put me in bed for three days which gave me a head start. Once I was well, though, the hunger raged back. So for all psychological intents and purposes, it was cold turkey driven by defiance and anger.  
""Fuck you, smoke. You're not my supervisor!"" ~ Cheryl/Carol

"A lot of people are saying cold turkey's the way to go, but that never worked for me.  When I quit, I weaned myself off them.  Of course, it helped that I was never that heavy of a smoker (3-4 cigarettes a day on average), so I can't speak to this method's efficacy when it comes to heavier smoking.  
Basically, I decided to go down to one cigarette a day by date X.  When that was manageable and I was settled into the ""one a day"" groove, I kind of made it a game to see how long I could go without one.  Eventually the stretches between smokes got so long (2 days or so) that my body's natural aversion to inhaling poison came back.  Then when I tried to smoke, it burned and my throat closed up.  The physical reaction to smoke at that point was so bad that it outweighed any pleasure I got from smoking.  Pavlovian conditioning FTW, as they say.
Good luck quitting.  I feel fantastic now, my clothes and stuff don't smell, and I've gotten into long distance running.  You can totally do this, just remember that there's no wrong way to quit except not quitting.  Whatever gets you there is the right way!
EDIT: Spelling"
"I quit using ecigs as well. If you want a cheap great way to try them out most gas stations carry ""Enjoy"" brand, feels and looks just like a real cig, VERY LIGHT...they are disposable and I believe cost like $8...HIGHLY RECCOMEND for a first time ecig user, you will want to upgrade eventually but these will have you sold. "
"""My trigger is being at work""......  wrong. Your trigger is between your ears and you can control it by wanting to quit and live more than you want to die from cancer or heart disease at an early age. When you quit your life will suck for about 3 or 4 weeks, you'll get insomnia and be irritable but then soon after, you'll be free, richer, have more lung power, will smell and taste better, be more attractive and more confident because you just did something many people cannot."
"Three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia. Couldn't smoke. Came out, decided to keep going. Completely unplanned."
"Cold turkey and Wellbutrin. I went cold turkey, it was difficult and I still occasionally smoked but still less than before. I was then prescribed the Wellbutrin (not for smoking cessation reasons), and I found it easier to give up smoking for good."
">You only get a break if you step outside and light up.
I've never understood that. Plenty of jobs seem to have the idea that if you take a break, you're slacking, but if you take a _smoke_ break, you're fine.
If you can handle being around other smokers _without_ lighting up (probably pretty hard), you could just continue to take the smoke breaks, but not smoke. That sounds nearly impossible from a willpower sense, though."
I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this but accupuncture really works! I believe it was the ones he put in my ears that did it!
"I would smoke a cigarette then gag myself. Not by sticking my fingers down my throat, but by just doing a bit of a dry heave until it felt like I was about to throw up. After doing this every time I smoked for about a pack I quit cold turkey. Today the thought of smoking makes me feel sick. It may be fucked up, but it helped me kick a 5 year habit.
TL;DR I gagged myself into feeling sick after every cigarette. "
"Cold turkey and commitment.  You have to really want to quit and not just sort of want to quit.  It still took a bunch of tries, but eventually I was able to do it and I don't take being able to breathe normally for granted anymore."
"I tried going cold turkey a year ago. For me it didn't work 100%, I've had maybe a pack worth over the last year. Mainly when I'm out at a bar. In my opinion it's a win. I was smoking 3 packs a week before. Maybe I should buy a electronic cigarette for when I go out."
I smoked and chewed so I quit smoking and started chewing more.
"Finding a sport I like. 
Since starting to practice martial arts, I had so much fun doing it that I had to quit smoking since I wasn't able to catch up with the others. 
Sometimes I have a fallback when I'm drunk but since I stopped drinking alcohol too, I don't need to smoke. 
Anyways that is an important thing in my opinion. You have to quit smoking related habits too like drinking coffee or drinking beer. "
"My wife and i both had bronchitis for two weeks straight which made us go cold turkey.  Here's some tips that helped us out
* Going cold turkey only works if you actually REALLY want to quit.
* Try to avoid hanging out with smokers for a while and don't beat yourself up when you give in.  Just get back on the horse and expect to be an irritable prick for a short while. 
* If you have a hand-to-mouth fixation, try flavored toothpicks/cinnamon sticks/candy canes.
* Find something else to occupy your time when you have a craving like walking, music, exercise, those little chinese balls that have the chimes in them, a yo-yo.. "
"I smoked for more than 20 years and I just hated it towards the end. It was clear I was only smoking because I was addicted and that had to stop. I think really hating smoking helped me a lot.
My young son had also been taking jiu jitsu for more than a year and the gym was really great. I had always been into watching combat sports and I had been wanting to give it a try but it is very expensive. I realized in July that it cost more to smoke than it did to take jiu jitsu. So I quit the next day and showed up at jiu jitsu instead.
I'm still quit and I am still going to jiu jitsu. I don't have any cravings anymore and I think this is it, I'm going to make it this time."
"I started using grizzly (chewing tobacco AKA dip) and it allowed me to quit cigarettes without the huge nic fits my father was having at the same time (42 years of smoking h
e quit cold turkey) while only using it once or twice a day in the late evening. About a month later I quit dipping because the habit was so disgusting I couldn't handle it anymore. "
I quit the day I found out I was pregnant.
"I was pretty much just a social smoker but I started hanging out with this girl I was obsessed with and I just didnt want to smoke around her. She never actually told me to not smoke, but I used her as motivation."
"The only thing worked for me was being ready to quit.  I had tried 7 or so times, but I still really loved smoking. 
When I quit the last time I decided that I needed to make some changes in my life and the easiest thing for me to do to make my life better was quit smoking.  3.5 years later it is still one of the best decisions I have ever made.  
I will also say that it really doesn't get easier, which is why you need to be ready.  This morning I was really angry with my roommates and my comute to work was 50% longer than it should have been because of the weather.  I caught myself more than once thinking about how much easier it was to de-stress when I was a smoker.  "
Lung cancer
"I switched to an electronic cigarette. 
I've been without cigarettes for over a month now, which might not sound like much to non-smokers but to those who do smoke you will probably understand that even a month is quite an achievement. 
After 5 weeks, I feel a lot healthier. I can breathe easier, my taste and smell are a lot better, I have more energy and at the end of a long day my chest doesn't hurt from smoking. Plus I've saved a lot of money. 
I'm still getting the nicotine, but the switch wasn't easy at first as it is very different to actually smoking. I really enjoy the e-cigarette now though, and I'd really recommend looking into getting a decent starter setup for anyone who wants to quit. Something like an eGo-C Twist with an EVOD tank. 
/r/electronic_cigarette is a sub with lots of people happy to give advice and help anyone ready to stop smoking cigarettes. From the experiences I've read on there, it seems like it's a lot easier to bring down your nicotine levels with an e-cigarette as well. 
"
"I knew I had to quit smoking eventually but I couldn't find the desire to actually go through it. I stumbled on a post from /r/electronic_cigarette ordered a real e-cig kit and ""tried"" it. I feel in love with vaping then and there. My last cigarette was about 3 minutes before I opened e-cig kit on 7/1/13. Not a single cigarette since and it was super-easy for me. 
Other folks I know need to tinker with an e-cig that gives them the throat hit of a real cigarette. There are e-cigs in the stores and online that give a cigarette-like hit, won't kill you and instead help you wean yourself off of the nic. 
For a while, I still went outside to vape, to feed the habit, but now, I vape all day inside and don't miss going outside in the rain to smoke. I was a 1.5+ pack a day smoker for 18 years. I don't miss it a single bit. 
Good luck on quitting!"
Cold turkey. I then set aside the cost of a pack every time I would have bought one. Seeing how much I was spending really set in the fact that I needed to quit.
"I found I needed to start 3 or 4 days alone without exercise. Stress from dealing with people while craving was unbearable. Also, you might think that a little exercise would be healthy, but it just increased the cravings.
What will get you through it is knowing that the cravings will get more intense for about three weeks, but will become farther apart. And the cravings only last a few minutes at a time. Each craving feels impossible to overcome, but just wait it out. Each craving spell you get through increases your confidence and determination to overcome this lowly plant.
Also, remember to breathe deeply once in a while. It really decreases the stress. Smokers don't realize it, but they only ever breathe deeply while dragging on a cigarette, and then associate the relief with nicotine. It helps to inhale deeply through a restriction like a thin straw or your clenched fist. "
Marianas maintenance program
"I tapered down to one cigarette a day from one pack. It took about a year. Getting into fitness helped.
I have not smoked on a regular basis now for about two years. I still have one occasionally, but it usually only reaffirms my desire to not be a smoker.
OP, respectfully, using it as an excuse to take a break at work is total bullshit. Take a little walk around the building or something instead. Get some fresh air instead of putting poison in your lungs.
And I would avoid e-cigarettes altogether; they seem to only make it easier to continue nicotine dependency."
My dad smoked about 6 or 7 packs a day from the age of 12. On his 42nd birthday he had a heart attack but lived. He went cold turkey after that. He said he just didn't feel like smoking any more. I think it helped that his dad died of lung cancer the year before.
"I quit with the help of a Vapor E-cig.  It was a long process and I relapsed quite a few times. But finally it got to the point where cigs started making me sick. Good luck to you man, shits not easy. "
I read The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. I finished it in 8 hours and never picked up another cig from the time I closed the book.

"first and foremost - (as cliched as this is to say...) you have to WANT to quit. Even if it is just a ""somewhat urge"" to do so. 
Second - accept there will be temptation, and possibly 'failure'. 
Being able to accept that you might go out for a few beers and fall off the wagon as ""no big deal"" instead of damming yourself for not giving up is a big win for your mental state - you were momentarily weak, you gave in, get up and start again.
Third - doing something along the ""chain"" system - mark off each day you don't smoke. If you REALLY struggle, break it down - 1. Can you go a day? 2. Can you go a week? 3. Can you go 2 weeks? 4. Can you go a month?.... WHEN you reach your goals, you can decide how you wish to proceed - do you want to fall off and start again, or try and stay on target for the NEXT goal instead? No judgement on what you do. But give yourself only a few days to be ""off"" the wagon - then you jump back on.
Try to NOT smoke in the morning - set a time of day that if you wish to smoke, you can only do so AFTER that time, just not the morning.
Acknowledge your ""break"" points - do you always smoke after a meal? with coffee? waiting for a bus? walking to work? - can you break the association? listen to a song first, draw a picture of 10 chickens...anything to distract your mind.
It is a tough battle, but I think if you break it down into small victories and change your mind set - it is not that you have given up smoking, it is just that you haven't smoked for x-days/months/years and you just leap-frog from victory to victory, to a point where you might smoke a cigarette and say ""this is the 1st cigarette I have smoked this year"".... No shame in falling, just in not getting back up again!
Again - as cliched as it is to say - Fall down 7 times, get up 8."
"Probably get buried, but I hope this helps who ever sees it. there was a mind trick thread, and this guy used a mind trick to help him quit. He said whenever he had a urge to smoke, he'd think ' What a weird thing for a non-smoker to think.' idk if this mind trick works, since I don't smoke, but seems like a good trick. "
"After smoking for about 15 years, I finally just quit cold turkey.  Smoking was something I never planned on doing long term and I knew I needed to quit eventually because it's so unhealthy.  What triggered me to quit though was seeing my 2 year old son pick up an unopened pack of cigarettes and start ""packing"" them.  It was easy for me to quit after that and it's been 4 years now.  It was just easier when I considered how my smoking can affect my loved ones.
It has been harder for my girlfriend to quit, but she was finally able to stop smoking cigarettes by using a vaporizer.  Until proven otherwise, it seems at least better than smoking cigarettes. We aren't too concerned with the nicotine, being that it's just a stimulant like caffeine.
I do believe the bottom line for anyone has to be the genuine desire to quit.  Without it, it's going to be much more difficult to stop.  Also, I think planning to quit, by setting a date and/or deciding on a last pack, puts too much stress on quitting and even makes it more difficult.
Good luck!"
"I posted this in another thread as well, but what worked for me was going to a doctor.  I had multiple failed attempts at quitting.  So, I figured out that I needed to find out what I was doing to my body (which is the reason why people should quit is because of the health risks).  I went to the doctor and after some tests, I had early signs/stages of COPD.  I was 28 when I went to the doctor (I am in my very early 30's now).
I was told that I can either quit, or get put on an oxygen mask for the rest of my life.  Now, I have no idea if the oxygen mask thing was just a scare tactic or not, but it worked.  I quit that day.  Within 2-3 weeks, I no longer had any cough, food tasted better, I could breath better.
Also, let's hit the benefits that you may not realize.  When I first quit, I did not really think I would see many health benefits.  First off, I have been bad about smoking.  I started at a very early age.  I started when I was 15 or 16.  I had no idea that I actually lost my sense of taste like crazy.  I mean, you can still taste food, but it is more bland than you realize because of your lost sense of taste.  I feel like DareDevil, but with taste.  I am sure sensitive to spicy food now.  I used to be able to use Sriracha like ketchup, and now it is almost too spicy.
I lost my cough.  I had a small cough that never really went away.  It was not some big hacking cough or anything.  I never woke up in the morning hacking or anything.  Within a few weeks, that all went away.
I was able to breath very well.  Before, when I would work out, I would jog for maybe 20 minutes and stop because I was so out of breath.  I just assumed that was about the time I was too tired to continue.  Within 2-3 weeks of quitting smoking, I was able to go to 30-45 minutes of jogging before that happened.  I mean, sure, if I am doing weights or something, I can be out of breath in 10 minutes or something because of how physical that activity is, but when I am jogging, I normally need to stop before I am out of breath because I can feel my muscles burning (a good, workout burn).
But yeah, if you want motivation to quit, get a professional opinion like I did.  Go see a doctor, get some lung tests done, and see the damage first hand that you are doing"
"I lost a bet with my best friends. We were doing a doing a trip around Europe and I told my mates that if they guessed all 6 cards that I was holding that I would do absolutely anything they asked. 4 out of 5 of my friends guessed incorrectly but by some freak of nature the last person guessed correctly, who also happened to be my best mate. They all decided to get me to quit smoking. I guess I should be thankful that they didn't sign me up for a ballet class. 
EDIT: I made sure they didn't see, but based on the clues I gave them and the incorrect guesses off the other people the last person was able to guess correctly lol. "
"My good friends dad was a heavy smoker. After he was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer he quit. He said ""Death is a pretty good motivator.""
He was able to stick around for about a year and a half. Still miss that guy... "
"I know it sounds cliche- but I quit cold turkey. I just decided to stop. I didn't buy anymore cigarettes. Just passed the first month mark. Feeling good. My only slip up was with an electronic cigarette. I try to stay away from other smokers. And if I feel like lighting up, I find something else to do. Just keeping my mind off of smoking. It's not easy, believe me. Surround yourself with non smokers and supportive folks. Best of luck!!"
"I hate to say it, but the book ""The Easy Way"" by Allan Carr got me. I thought it was bullshit until about 3/4 of the way though and it's been a year and 2 days since I quit. PM me if you want to discuss more. "
"Sounds corny, but it worked for me. I made it my 2013 new year's resolution to quit smoking. I was out with friends, got wicked drunk, crashed at my friend's place. I had a pack on me that was full at the beginning of the night but when I woke up there was 1 left. So I had my last cigarette new year's day and I'm smoke free a year later.
If you really want to quit then you will find a reason to quit. If you say you want to quit, but keep putting it off or relapsing, you never will quit. Don't bother with patches, pills, gums, or whatever. Your willpower is all you need.
Your trigger is similar to mine. Find a way to deal with it. Instead of sneaking out to light up, step away and take a 5 min walk or shoot off an email, or hell browse reddit."
I had a girlfriend (now fiance) who didn't approve of the smoking. Not just because it's gross/unhealthy but her Dad had bad health because of it.  Made myself quit cold turkey for the relationships sake. Proud to say I'm 4 years smoke free.  
I quit smoking 8 months ago with great results. I recommend bourbon as a smoking cessation aid.
"Cold turkey worked for me.  One trick that helped me was to quitting smoking on a difficult day.  
In my case I quit smoking over a weekend bachelor party in Atlantic City.  After that weekend, whenever I had cravings I would always look back and say ""if I didn't smoke that weekend"" why would I smoke now.  
Also, never think you can have ""just one cigarette"".  I quit once for a year, another time for 2 years, and both times after thinking I could have ""just one"" I was back full blown smoking after a month.  I've been quit now since August 8th, 2006 and I don't think I'll ever puff a cigarette again."
"I went to college, and couldn't afford to smoke. Helped that when I did find money to buy a pack, after I had said I was quitting, my college comrades berated me into staying quit."
All my friends quit
"Decided I wasn't a smoker any more. 
Not, ""I'm quitting"" but rather,
 ""I don't smoke""."
"NICORETTE GUM. Have it on you at all times and when you feel the craving, ""dip it,"" like chewing tobacco and let the nicotine pour over your soul. There is always a large amount of will power that goes into quitting, but I have not bought a pack since September 11, 2011 and its all been because of two things. 
1. I WANTED TO QUIT, it will not stick without this quality
2. Nicorette. 
Here is something else for you, I still smoke. On a special occasion, once every three or four months I will have one and I never even think about going back to a pack a day. Wanting to quit followed by getting the help necessary to take control over the psychological addiction to smoking on a daily basis is the whole challenge. Once you quit, you will realize you the power over when you smoke, not the other way around. Although cigarettes are deadly and will kill you eventually, one every three or four months surely will not do anything. 
Get the power over it! Best decision I have ever made. "
"It took me three tries, but here's what really made that third one stick: cold turkey on 12hrs notice ( I used a coin flip before bed every night until one day it came up ""quit"") and then keep the half finished pack. That's right keep it. Keep it on you, or in your bag or coat pocket. I carried a half-pack for months, and it was torturous; but all day every day I had to actively choose not to smoke tobacco anymore. "
"Not quit but replaced with ecig, it helps even when your drinking or after a meal!"
"I stopped smoking in May of 2011. I smoked for about 14 years at that point. Tried many times to stop. Here's what finally worked. Going cold turkey and a lot of willpower. 
  Over the years I think I convinced myself that I actually liked smoking. The first step is telling yourself you don't like smoking. You have to really start to hate it. I psyched myself up for a while and all of a sudden quitting became something that was within my reach. 
I went from being a 40-a-day smoker to being smoke free in one morning. I just decided that enough was enough.

"The book Easyway by Allen Carr. Helped me and a lot of my friends years ago. Also, my best tip: don't light the next cigarette. Ever. Contragulations, you are now a non smoker."
Naggy Girlfriend. 
My mom did it with nicroette patches and e-cigs. She loved the e-cigs and I thought they were the coolest thing. She said she's never do them since that once person's cigarette exploded but she finally did it and quit in about 3 months
"Personally, the patch & Adrafinil let me get rid of the cravings and still focus at work.
But that was probably extremely unhealthy."
"I smoked for four years, up to a pack a day at some points. Was involved in a DUI accident where my bf and i had to literally crawl out of the back passenger window of his car to get out. (Yes, drinking and driving is stupid.) I broke my wrist in the accident. I was hauled to the hospital, he was hauled to jail (hospital first actually, so they could get his BAC).  My last pack of cigarettes was in that car. Sad thing is, I actually don't think I would have ever had the willpower to quit if it had not been for that. 
TL;DR : Car accident, pain meds.   "
"I've managed to quit using the gum.
Like 5 times :'("
"I quit because I saw my relative die a horrible and agonizing death with throat cancer, caused by smoking. The doctors couldn't do anything.

"The pictures of cancered organs and shits on cigs pack. Nah, just kidding those pictures are just bedtime scary story for smokers. At first you were taken by surprise and after awhile you were like "" awww, they put a picture of dead fetus now."""
Going to the gym so you can witness how much you are damaging your lungs and how much they dont work. I went just after a cigarette and sometimes high and come out coughing up brown phlegm. 
I don't smoke however I hear tea tree toothpicks are a great substitute for cigarettes.you can find them on amazon.
"Once you lose all desire to smoke you won't look back. If you feel like you're willing yourself to stop smoking that just means you still want to smoke but are forcing yourself not to. Force yourself long enough and you'll break and start smoking again. I smoked a pack a day for 6 years then one evening I quit. I didn't want to do it anymore. I cried a little but I got through the rest of the night, woke up the next day and broke the chain of having a smoke first thing after waking up.  Haven't had a smoke since and it's been 6months. I still have no desire to smoke, even when I get those little urges. I'm in the habit of not smoking and love it. I feel no different as a non smoker even after convincing myself cigs helped when I was agitated or nervous etc. you may feel as though the nerves have left but once you finish that smoke the nerves return again. Smoking does NOTHING to help ANYTHING!!"
"I freaking loved smoking! Smoked a little over a pack a day, but I had been contemplating quitting for a while because of cost, health risks, and the fact I didn't want to age prematurely. One day I ran out and just decided that was it. My friend thought it was because I couldn't afford them and foolishly bought me a pity pack. Turns out, this is what actually helped me the most. I kept that pack of cigarettes and would take one out and hold it every now and then when I really thought I needed one. Knowing that I could have one if the cravings got really bad put me at ease. Eventually, the cravings would subside, and by the time my SO had smoked the remainder of the pack, I was over it. I have 3.5 years under my belt. 
My SO quit by calling in sick for three days. Work days would include coffee runs, driving, and being around other smokers, so avoiding all of these triggers was the only way to start the process. He has been smoke free for two years. 
Good luck! "

"My girlfriend wanted to quit. So I got her an audio book. ""The easy way to quit smoking"" took her about 3 times listening to it. But she went cold turkey afterwards. That was a year ago and she's been cig free since. (Smoked for 14 years). It's even a good book to read/listen to for non smokers. Really helps you understand the addiction that nicotine is."
Cold turkey...with a heavy helping of pneumonia.  That'll do it every time.  I had tried everything short of hypnotism for nearly a decade.  One good bout of pneumonia fixed that problem.
"Hate to say it, but separating myself from the group of friends that smoked like chimneys. Not completely, but enough so I wasn't sitting around with them for hours on the daily."
"After many failed attempts, I took a years worth of bank statements. I added up all the $6-9 transactions at gas stations and grocery stores. That was about $2500 in a year I had spent on small little transactions. That's what finally got me to quit. It was technically cold turkey, but the fear of that money loss was a huge motivation. "
"I switched to e-cigarettes.  They are controversial in regards to the health effects, but the big things for me were:
1. No physical effect on my cardiovascular performance (in regards to my perception of my own stamina)
2. Taste great
3. No bad smell
4. Does not appear to stain my teeth.
5. Despite what many people will argue, it is not smoking.
The only downside is the addiction to nicotine that I still avoid dropping."
"Cold turkey is definitely the best method for giving up.
Keep in mind that after 3 days, the nicotine has left your body, everything after that is just psychological, in the mind. You do need to truly want to give up smoking to actually go through with it. If you're not too bothered, you're more likely to casually buy a pack and start again."
"i wasnt really that heavy of a smoker (a couple a day maybe, some days heavier/lighter), i guess a social smoker? started when i was 17 and lingered on until i was around 30 (33 now).. several cold turkey attempts, never really tried other ways.. i started getting into running in my late 20's so cigs definitely got in the way.. one day the cold turkey really stuck.. went months then broke down and had one because i was out drinking.. felt really bad about it the next day then that was the last of it.. the smell of smoke on clothes/fingers always disgusted me even when i was smoking.. also, i smoked a good amount of chronic from about 20 to late 20's.. when i first got into running i tried to make excuses on how it didnt really affect it, it definitely does.. i was conflicted for a while, but i eventually sort of gave it up.. i still toke on occasion but rarely now"
Motherfuckin e-cig.
"Losing my Grandmother to Emphysema, and even more recently, nearly a year since I had quit, my Grandfather to Cancer. Both were long time smokers, who had quit around 8 - 10 years ago. A big incentive and a reminder as to why to/why I did quit.
I smoked since I was 12, now 27. I will be a year smoke free in February. I was quite a heavy smoker, 90 grams of roll your own a week. I slowly cut that down over a couple months to 30 grams, then a few packs a week, then a pack, then nothing. Took maybe three and a half months all up to completely quit. But it was worth it.
Feel much better for it. I did use nicotine gum for the first week too, now I just chew regular gum. Feels good man."
"So I have quit cold turkey.  The thought of cigarettes repulses me now. I smoked for three years pack a day. Somehow I managed to associate my smoking with the most legendary hangover of all time. Now it's like a Vietnam flash back. Every time I see tobacco of any kind. I get these images of just projectile vomiting and slippery shlits. 
Or date a really really hott girl that doesn't like the smell of cigs. That seems to work. 
"
"I agree with going cold turkey, The night before I quit I had a really intense dream about cancer, I was so scared by it I woke up the next day and I didn't feel the need to smoke at all. 
Ive not touched them in 7 years.
My friend puts the money she would have spent on cigarettes in one of those ceramic banks you have to break, she saved over å£600 and now she just does it out of habit. "
"My issue is that I want to quit and I will go a few days without smoking but then as soon as the weekend rolls around and I'm drinking it is a NEED. I can't drink without smoking and it is so rough. Any tips on how to lessen the need? Or even just something that I can preoccupy my drunk mind with? I want to quit, I hate smoking around my non-smoking friends and boyfriend. "
I used an e-cig and slowly dropped the nicotine content to 0. I still smoke the e-cig for the oral fixation but with no nicotine.
"Chantix, sort of. I quite a few years ago using it. Got hooked again, and tried last year with it but didn't follow the protocol the way I should have. Just quit again 8 weeks ago and so far so good. Note: I was primarily a user of chewing tobacco, but occasionally smoked."
"I smoked an entire carton (200 cigarettes) of parliament full flavors in 14 hours. Truly awful, fingertips were stained yellowish for a bit, so much eye gunk and the thought of a smoke made me nauseous for months. 0/10, would not recommend, made quitting easier though. "
"I quit in a weirdly gradual way. I live in Michigan, first they banned smoking in bars/restaurants. Then they banned it at my old job (college campus) and then I wasn't able to smoke in my apt. and had to go outside. After starting a new job in k-12, you can't smoke anywhere near the property... I just got fed up with having to jump through hoops so i just kinda stopped buying them. It's been 8 months, but I got drunk once or twice with a few friends who smoked and bummed one off of them. plus with this miserable ass winter, the last thing i'd wanna do right now is go outside and smoke. "
"I read Alan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. It tells you everything you already know about smoking and helps you get past the fear of quitting. I have been 2 years cigarette free, will never smoke again, and I am loving it. 
edit: added:
I just wanted to add that I started reading the book without the mindset of quitting but it convinced me. One of the biggest reasons is that as a smoker you are in constant withdrawal unless you are smoking at that moment. Nicotine leaves our bodies almost immediately after we ingest it. So I thought, how hard could a few weeks of withdrawal be if I have been experiencing it almost constantly for 8 years? The hardest part I found after quitting cold turkey was that I felt I needed to go do something/go outside every hour, which gradually went away.  "
"I use the e-cigs you can get from the supermarket.  I've considered more complex things because they are cheaper (in the long run) and more configurable (if you mix and match the components and mix your own liquid).  The strength of the supermarket type e-cig is that they're now ubiquitous where I live (which is in a village), the cartridges are interchangeable (if you can't find your own brand) and they're very cheap (å£6 per week).  I switched to these from the Nicorette spray which worked kind-of, except when I was having booze.  E-cig lets me continue to enjoy my nicoteen stimulant without the known badness of the humble cigarette."
"My uncle smoked for years. Then he got lung cancer and died. That stopped his smoking.
It also was what actually worked for me, to get me to quit. No cigs for 8 years, I chew Nicorette whenever I get the urge.."
"On the one hand I don't know that I've ever been ""addicted"" to smoking, I did smoke for about 14 years but mostly casually. The one time I began feeling I ""needed"" it I decided to quit. 
About 3 days into quitting I woke up in the night desperate for a cigarette but knowing that in my 100+ year old apartment there were none. I began turning furniture upside down and opening drawers in a desperate attempt to locate a stray cigarette or undiscarded butt. 
I finally located what appeared to be an intact cigarette wedged between the hardwood and the baseboard. I dug it out with a coathanger, it was old and stiff and the filter broke off pulling it out. 
I lit up the unfiltered part and took a huge hit. It was disgusting. It tasted like mop water had soaked it and dried out repeatedly for years (probably did) and on top of that it was a menthol. 
From that point on whenever I craved a cigarette that taste came back into my mouth and I was pretty much free. 
I have smoked occasionally since then in the 15 years that followed, but along the lines of a pack a year (or less) always because others are smoking near me and I've had a few drinks - but I've never been able to get that taste out of my memory. "
"You have to actually want to quit.  I know that sounds like a no shit statement, but its the truth.  Once I had mentally gone through the train of thought of how really fucking stupid smoking is on many different levels.  I.E. makes you feel like shit if you smoke to much during an outing at a bat, how much money you are just pissing away, how I was getting short of breath doing small physical acts, how obsessive I was about getting one when I didn't have any left plus the PMS style mood swings.
After going through that to the point of being just pissed off over it I quit the next day.  Just dropped it.  Now I have had a few on the occasion of going out to the bar, but that has stopped as well.  I have been a smoker for 15 years have been an ex smoker for 6 months."
"Try, try, and try again. Took me 9 attempts before I was finally successful. "
"Cannabis! 
Roll it into something, gives the same feel as a cigarette but by the time you're done you forget what a cigarette even is."
"I tried several times to quit smoking. The longest and best attempt resulted in about 2 months of being a non-smoker. Usually one stressful event sets me off again. But I started smoking an electronic cigarette and weaned down on the nicotine levels. I started at high and move down from there, finally using the non-nicotine kind. Then I just started using it less and less until I stopped using it altogether. It was actually easy, because I started to prefer the taste of the electronic cigarettes to the taste of actual cigarettes. It was nice not smelling like an ashtray and being able to smoke it inside. It was all really easy, actually. Use nicorette lozenges to supplement if necessary. Toothpicks and candy also help. I just did everything and prayed that it would all work. "
"**TLDR: Nicotine gum. Chew it when you have a craving. Ignore the instructions in the box.**
It sounds like cold turkey is the preferred method, but I want to make an argument for nicotine gum. Not everyone is able to put mind over matter as well as the commenters who quit cold turkey, so perhaps this is a better option for them.
I quit smoking cold turkey for 14 months before I hit a particularly stressful period and decided I'd allow myself one pack, etc., etc. The habit came back with a vengeance (I was smoking double what I was before I quit). 
After a couple years of attempting to quit cold turkey again and then failing after a few months, I decided to get the gum. The instructions in the packaging are complex, and some people get addicted to the gum because of how much they suggest you chew, so I decided I would only chew a piece when I craved a cig. And I negotiated with myself - if I ever still wanted a cig after I had a piece of gum, I could have one. Never happened. The gum lasts way longer than a craving.
I began to crave cigs less and less and also was making an effort to only have the gum when I really needed it -- not every minor moment of weakness. And then one day I didn't need it anymore. I remember worrying toward the end of the box that I'd run out and then need to buy another box, which would tempt me to keep chewing, but that never happened. In the end, I had one sheet of gum (maybe 12 pieces) left that I kept in my office drawer just in case, but I never needed it.
*Side note: You should follow the part of the instructions that teach you how to chew the gum and then put it in a cheek pocket when it tingles. Otherwise you will get sick.*"
I smoked for 9 years and what worked for me was quitting cold turkey. I think the only way that this will work is if someone truly wants to quit. 
"I quit cold turkey. You can do it. Any time you crave, just know that the craving will pass. Even if you get a few waves of cravings in a row, they will stop. You have to really think to yourself, I'm bigger than this craving. And also keep any tobacco-related products out of your purse/car/home/etc. YOU CAN DO IT! It is worth it! "
Allen Carrs Easy way to stop smoking book... Clean 4 years on the 17th of January
The idea that continuing a habit makes it stronger.
"Just stop cold turkey, it's really that simple.  Sorry this is probably not the answer you're looking for.  I was smoking a pack a day for 4 years and one day literally just said ""fuck this"" and that was that."
"It's true. Cold turkey is the best way. I've been a smoker for ten plus years and I've quit so many times and it's been horrible failure after horrible failure. I have only been smoke free for about three weeks this time but I was ready. I said to myself, my boyfriend, my friends ""I quit. I don't smoke!"" And just haven't picked one up since. I do know, however that I cannot be around a lot cigarette yet because I will most likely ask for a drag or one of my own. It's not been going too bad but there are days when I really ""need"" to smoke but instead, u knit. I found something else to do with my hands. Something to focus my mind on so every time I want to smoke I knit. I've made three scarves so far.....cold turkey all the way. Why replace one addiction with another? Ecigs just make I all too comfortable to go back to smoking. The gum is gross."
"There's no miracle cure for cigarette addiction. You just gotta make a promise to yourself that you'll quit, and keep that promise. That's what I did.    "
"Add the cost of smoking/month and your vehicle payment/month, now go buy a vehicle that costs that much/month.  You will love your vehicle way more than you did smoking."
A stale Marlboro Light.
"I used the power of procrastination! I just kept telling myself I'd smoke in just a little bit. I even kept a half pack of cigarettes in the back room at the back of a drawer so it would be possible but inconvenient to smoke at any time. I'm really bad about procrastinating, but in this case it turned out to be a strength. 
I've read (and my own experience has borne out) that nicotine cravings last for about two minutes and then subside for a while. 
I smoked for 10 years,  and this March it will be 10 years since I last smoked a cigarette, by putting it off 2 minutes at a time. 
"
"So yeah, picking a day worked for me too. It was my birthday so I had a little more motivation. Plus, I got my wisdom teeth removed that day and didn't want to smoke. By the time I recovered I just stuck with it and was free if cigarettes forever. "
"Try running for a minute non stop,  your body will sound a million alarms,  the feeling you will get is how you will always be feeling 10 years down the road"
"Systematically cut-back your intake over the course of a few weeks. Excise self-discpline and try and limit yourself to a certain number per day, hour w/e
As your taste buds start to grow back become aware of how disgusting the cigarettes taste and the guilt you will have if you smoke one. ( I also used the gum, but mix it w/ regular gum because it tastes terrible)"
"Using Chantix!!!
Finally worked on my third attempt. Chantix makes cigarettes taste like donkey balls so you get sick of them. Must also make conscious ""quit date"" and effort to actually stop on & after that date. 
From time to time I do have the spare cigarette but they generally taste like ASS now and I have no inclination (FINALLY) to smoke. 
This is after twenty years of smoking, multiple efforts to quit (sometimes quitting as long as three years). I've currently been ""quit"" (not counting the occasional ass-ciggie) for just over a year (New Years 2013). 
Yay me, yay Chantix!! 
Also - it works by blocking the nicotine receptors in your brain so they can't ""get off"" on the nicotine so you stop getting jollies when you smoke. "
"I got nicotine poisoning from the patch, was sick as a dog for three days, and done with cigarettes when I recovered. 
Sometimes I still want one, though."
"Getting away from people that smoked. I was a contractor for DoD and it is so hard to get away from that since it is the only known way to get a break. Luckily it was easy as I got a new non-DoD job and it is much easier when you don't surround yourself with other smokers. The other thing to remember is 3 days. It takes about 3 days for that crap to work it's way out of your system and you will then start to taste things differently and smell others. There is an aura of smoke that surrounds smokers that they can't smell. I can even tell when a smoker had been in an elevator within the last 15 minutes at work because it is so potent. Once you start smelling that and realize that you couldn't even notice the pungent odor, it may make you think twice before trying again. Also running helped motivate me."
"I quit cold turkey. No drinking for a month. I smoked a TON of pot however to placate the smoking urge. I still had some urges after that first month, especially when drinking, but i was able to ignore them since they were rather weak.  It's been 6 years since I've quite. I was smoking a pack and a half to two packs a day for a decade. Reds/royals at that too. I still cough up black shit every now and then though lol."
"I didn't quit smoking, but a 10+ year chewing tobacco habit after watching my Mom go through three amputations before dying of lung cancer.  She was still smoking.
That was a compelling enough reason for me to not give any more money to tobacco companies."
"Chantix is a phenomenal solution for anyone struggling to quit smoking. I smoked a pack a day for 10 years and after 2 weeks on this pill I've never looked back. I've been a nonsmoker for 3 years now, the extra money you'll save really stacks up! "
"Then-girlfriend (now-wife) wouldn't kiss me for an hour after I had a smoke, and only after I brushed and used mouthwash."
"Turning 28, and realizing I've been smoking for half of my existence. Motivation and desire to quit, a lot of sugar free chewing gum, plus an app that keeps score of money saved has helped immensely. 
472 days, and close to 3000 USD saved."
"Some one might have said this, but after going a few days without a cig I was craving nicotine so I got a dip from my friend. Within a few minutes the mixture of the nicotine buzz, taste and texture turned me off to tobacco altogether."
"I agree with those that say cold turkey is the best method because it is. I think it strengthens your resolve compared to using patches etc, and keeps your resolve strong. 
The key to giving up smoking is less about the willpower and more about the technique and how you prepare for it. 
I spent several weeks beforehand only smoking outside, smoking a brand of roll ups that I didn't like the taste of, and extreme chain smoking. All for the purpose of turning me against smoking. 
I also made a list of reasons why I wanted to give up and what would keep me motivated afterwards. 
You also need to go into the mindset of switching off completely against smoking and building up a hard mental barrier against it. That means it's important to remember that ""just one won't hurt"" WILL hurt, and don't try e-cigs as a substitute. 
Even now I don't ever think about smoking but if I ever had just one cig I know that I would be back to 50 a day in no time because that's how addiction works. 
The truth of the matter is, if you've once been an addict once then you're an addict for life because no matter how many years you've given up it will get you again if you give it chance. 
Signed... 
Ex smoker of approx 2 years and 8 months who used to smoke more than 50 roll ups per day"
"For me it was all about not wanting my daughter to grow up seeing me smoke. I always tried to hide it from her, but as she got past the toddler stage this became harder to do. So I was ready, and I had a reason.
Then it came down to having a plan. I knew my biggest triggers were being in the car and after dinner. How was I going to handle those times? I decided to take a walk after dinner, and have lots of books around to read if I didn't feel like walking. I got gum for the car. I had my car cleaned, detailed, so it smelled nice.
I went on Chantix. It made me nauseated sometimes, but it it did help with reducing cravings. 
Lastly, I joined an on-line support group. I would say this was probably the least helpful thing I did. It was good to talk with other people going through the same thing for awhile, but pretty soon I noticed there were people on there that had been there for years, still talking about not smoking. I didn't want any part of that. I didn't want to in any way identify as being a former smoker. Smoking just wasn't relevant to me anymore, why would I want to talk about it? So yeah, that only lasted maybe a month.
Than I just decided I was done. Went off the Chantix and just decided I was not a smoker anymore.
I sometimes miss it if I'm out having a few beers. I think I could probably smoke a few without going back to it as a habit, but so far I just haven't touched one.
I do think you have to just decide to quit and quit. The gum and patches still feed the addiction.
One thing - people always told me that my senses of smell and taste would improve when I quit, and that was bull. Nothing at all changed. Maybe that's just me, but I was kind of pissed about it. Was looking forward to my new super-senses."
"Five alive; or some other sharp fruit juice.
When I got a cigarette craving, I'd pound a bottle of that.  It took my mind off the craving pretty instantly."
"I ended up quitting after I moved. New surroundings and creating new habits help a lot. I understand most people can not move, but you do have some influence what you choose to do in the situations where you usually smoke.. for example, I used to smoke after I ate every day so instead of smoking I would play Candy Crush after I ate instead. I do agree with the  other posts that say you just really have to find something worth it enough for you to quit. I finally had enough. After 7 years my friends and I bragged about how much control we had over our smoking, never realizing we really didnt.. I wanted the control I had lost.  back. ( I was also trying for a baby so that helped as well)"
"Coffee.
I never smoke and drank coffee together. One day I decided to try coffee, only having it once in a great while, and noticed that my urge to have a smoke was supressed.
I kept drinking a cup of coffee whenever I felt like smoking until I got to the point that I didn't have the urge anymore.
I am now heavily addicted to coffee as a side effect, but I've been able to cut back on coffee a lot easier then cutting back on cigs. Been two years.
Edit: I highly doubt this will work for anyone else because I am insane."
"This won't be helpful but I smoked for near a decade, tried to quit several times, rarely successful. Tried patches, hypnosis, gum, the works.  The only time I was successful was when I realized I was finished. I didn't set a date I just realized I didn't want them anymore and walked away. The point is once you're really ready it will be easier... at least that was my experience. Good luck friends"
Truly wanting to quit. 
"E-cigs.
You can't get those shitty Blu Cigs from your corner grocery store. Those things are mildly scammy, since they make you buy a new cartridge everytime you need more juice.
The e-cigs that have a tank where you can buy a bottle of liquid and fill it yourself are what you want. These are found at decent local e-cig shops, and online at a trusted site like [Halo](http://50ave.com/halo.php). Also, the vapor juice (your nicotine solution) that you use to refill with, make sure it's sourced from American/Canadian ingredients. Halo also has good American e-juice."
"I have quit for the first time. 
I haven't smoke since Jan 15th 2013
Over 379 days!
Secret : Nicotrol Inhaler

"[Here is what I did to quit, Submitted this a few years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mrqpj/what_worked_for_me/)"
"I tried to quit 6x times before I was successful. My success story was like this:
I didn't know I really wanted to quit. I read ""The Easy Way to Quit Smoking"" without trying to put down a cigarette until after I finished reading it. The cravings were still too much. I used the patch along with the knowledge I had from the book and distancing myself from smokers until I was ready.
You need to have some desire to quit. The book WILL help if you read it all the way through.
Good luck!!! "
"being cheap. I wasn't a smoker but a chewer. 1) Copenhagen became $7 a can. I was a can and a half per day chewer, so I was spending over 3k per year for nicotine. 2) My Dr prescribed Chantrix to help quit. The cost was $300. I figured I would try on my own first before shelling out the cash..and i was able to quit. First 3 days I felt like I lost my best friend, after that it get much much easier. 7 years now and I never think about it.
Also, I had recently quit drinking...way too hard to drink and not consume nicotine."
"My husband developed a blood clotting disorder and was told to quit but he wouldn't quit unless I quit too. The doctors said if he didn't stop smoking he would definitely speed up his expiration date. So I quit to save his life with Chantix. He has told me that if I smoke again, he'll go back to smoking too. It's the worst form of emotional blackmail but it's been working for more than 4 years now :)
 "
V2 brand e-cigs. They're the only ones I've tried that feel like you're smoking a real cigarette.
"Cold Turkey. If it's too hard to do that, just don't buy a pack. Bum a smoke when you really need it but never buy a pack. After about 3 weeks the cravings go away.
Also prepare yourself mentally or avoid situations where you habitually smoked. Mine was when I drove, so I took the bus for a couple weeks instead.
In summary, cold turkey, avoid situations where you habitually smoked, and never ever buy a pack"
For me it was twofold.  Number one- I bought a new car and didn't want to smoke in it.  Even as a smoker I knew how gross my old car had smelled and I didn't want that again!  Number two-I got sick.  I had an awful cold for about a week and couldn't smoke.  When I got better I realized I didn't have an y cigarettes and figured why bother.  
"I'm going on 9 months now and I will never go back (smoked for ~10 years). I used some nicco gum for the first 3 days. After that, it was all about the mindset. I had to tell myself every day for 2 months that I wasn't quitting anything- I was starting something new and fantastic. For 4 months after that, I only had to remind myself of that mantra once a week. Now, I can't believe I ever smoked. I'm a nicer, more confident person for it. That's my anti-drug.
Also, it helped me to not involve loved ones or friends no matter how much I wanted to. I would be too stressed about disappointing them or lying to them and it would make me crave. This may not be a good strategy for everyone- some people benefit from having a sponsor of sorts."
"VAPING! I swear to you, it works the best. I smoked for years, and one day I just decided to buy a vape! Have never looked back. I can't even take a drag off of a cigarette without wanting to barf. Whats nice about vapes it you get to choose your nicotine level. Start off where you are with cigarettes (usually 16mg) and slowly work your way down. I am currently only at 6mg. PLUS! you don't stink, and there are SO many incredible flavors. I recommend this to everyone and everyone. "
"AND you can vape inside. I vape inside at work all the time. My bosses don't care, they actually encourage it! "
"Hands down, the electronic cigarette.  From there I could control my nicotine levels and eventually quit completely. "
I've been cig free about 8 month now and it is all thanks to Allen Carr's book The Easy Way. I will never smoke again. 
"Tried loads of times before with patches, gums, ecigs, etc. What worked in the end was simple willpower. The moment was simply right. Combination of minor health scare (couldn't breathe properly - wasn't anything serious, but boy did it get the message home of how horrible a lung problem could be) and better half asking. Showed me that it's all in your mind. I smoked for 20 years and loved every cigarette I ever smoked, but quitting was amazingly easy if the mindset and moment are right. Never looked back. "
"What worked for me was taking Wellbutrin, an anti-depressant that did two things for me:  lowered cravings, and dealt with life stressors that were undermining my determination.  That, and the realization that I will always be a smoker who chooses not to smoke.
Prior to taking the medication, I didn't realize I had a problem with depression, but I did realize I easily became angry or anxious at things that wouldn't upset others in the same way, and in these situations I always reached for a cigarette. So I could quit for months and then have my progress derailed by a bad argument with my husband, or getting laid off the job, etc.  Poor me, have a smoke, who the fuck cares anyway. I was psychologically addicted as well as physically.
 When I went initially to the doctor to ask for help quitting smoking, it was after 4-5 failed attempts on my own over several years.  Two of those times were pregnancies, in which morning sickness helped me quit but I started again due to the natural stress of having a newborn and no familial support system to help me cope with that.  Another restart after quitting was due to being laid off a job. By this time I had smoked over 20 years and at various times had smoked nearly 2 packs a day.
  I expected the doctor to give me an anxiety medication and was surprised when he gave me this instead, but by golly it worked.  It came as part of a smoking cessation package that includes reading materials to help understand the double sided nature of the physical and psychological addiction, and access to online support tools for tracking progress, much like Alli uses for weight loss.  The main thing is you gotta keep trying again, after every failure, just realize it is an addiction and treat it like alcoholism....if you fall off the wagon just forgive yourself, get back on it again tomorrow, and resolve to try attacking it again in a new way.
My self control and resolve improved with the medication, and the physical cravings became low enough that I could deal with them with using the nicotine patches at first, then later I  switched to the  gum to taper off, once I had broken the mental habit of reaching for that cigarette when my daily triggers would kick in ( picking up a phone, after a meal, breaks at work, etc).  I used sugarless gum to replace reaching for cigarettes, I would unwrap a piece of gum instead.
 The reason I don't recommend e-cigs is because the goal is to transfer your addiction to a healthier and lesser nicotine source while you break psychological dependence and habits first, then to taper off the new thing you are addicted to.  How exactly do e-cigs help you break the psychological habit of what to do with your hands and how you spend your break time, since no change is being made to those habits?  And are they any easier to taper off from than gum or patches?  At least if you switch to patches or gum, your lungs are weaning off being bathed in nicotine all day.  And the patches give you less nicotine per day, so your whole body is getting used to having less of it circulating in your blood day by day, whereas e-cigs don't accomplish that.
I have been smoke free 15 years now, and can attest that life does exist after quitting, that you do eventually stop thinking about cigarettes all day.   So hang in there!  Still, about once a year I have a dream in which I realize I am dreaming so it is ok to buy a pack and light up.  I guess my brain still misses them all these years later, you may too, and that is OK."
i stopped doing other drugs first
"I used to smoke almost 2 packs a day when I was a Chef, I slowly started cutting back to under a 1/2 pack a day...
It took significant willpower to do the cutback.  After a week or so of zero cigs, I was over it.
It has been about 4.5/5 years now...I occasionally still crave them.
Benefits - Food tastes better, I can breathe, I no longer hack up the lungbutter, its wonderful "
My bf smoked for 10 years. One week before the new year this year he bought a ecig. He hasn't' had a cig since. I am happy.
"willpower - trying your hardest to not have one when you think you really want/need one.
eventually the longer you fight the temptation the addiction begins to gradually grow further to the point where they will most likely disgust you."
"ITT: Just Quit. 
Really nothing to it but to do it. I quit smoking 7 months ago and haven't looked back. You just have to want it enough."
"Bupropion (Zyban/Wellbutrin) worked for me. I've been smoke free for almost two years now.  Haven't had a puff since. Though, I'm the kind of person that can't only have one, so I know how dangerous it would be to cheat a little.  If you are a drinker, you probably need to commit to stop drinking for the initial month you quit smoking.  Since I was on the drug, I wasn't willing to mix the two.  I sure had some intense/weird dreams. I think it's idiotic to say that side effect is reason to stop taking the drug and to start smoking again.  About four weeks into taking the drug (three weeks nicotine free) I started feeling depressed.  It took me a couple days to make the connection that the drug was making me feel that way. I had never experienced depression before.  My doctor said to wean myself off by taking a half dose the next two days then stopping.  I felt better after a few days and was smoke free.  My only advice would be to take the warnings to heart about paying attention to your mood while on it."
"Chest pain. Hard, stinging chest pain, possibly my heart and lungs.  After every inhale it felt like knives were coming.  It's not good for you, indeed it does kill you."
"Well, I went to a doctor regarding the cysts I occasionally get. He told me they are harmless, and that because my skin has this quality, I should still look pretty good when I'm 50. I decided that I didn't want to waste this advantage by smoking, so I stopped. 
  "
"I had agreed on a quit date with a friend. She said she wanted to quit, and I decided I did, too. I made it through the first day. The second day, I broke down, bought a pack, smoked half of it in 2 hours and threw them out. Started my quit again after that. 
We went out two nights later and I was ridiculously drunk. I begged for one. I took two puffs and wanted to ralph. I haven't looked back. 
Occasionally, as all my friends still smoke, I'll catch a whiff that reminds me of all those ""good times"", then I catch the next whiff and my throat hurts. 
It's going to be different for everyone, but, also, reading Alan Carr's book helped me a lot. Not right away, but it was always there in the back of my head. 
Good luck!"
I hated smelling like the inside of an old man's anus. 
"I am close to being a year without cigarettes. I choose to quit this time because I was tired of being a slave to a tube of paper and leaves. I had panic attacks when I was down to my last cigarette in the pack. I would plan my day around breaks so I could smoke. Because I would not smoke at home I would invent reasons to stay late at work and smoke more. 
The best thing for me was the attitude change, tobacco smoke smells disgusting to me now, I hate getting in an enclosed area with smokers now. I don't associate with them as much because of it so the those triggers are not there anymore.
One day I hit a wall and got fed up. In the past I have tried gum, cold turkey and the patch. This time attitude had a lot to do with my success this time around. I did use nicotine replacement ( the lozenge )for 45 days while I worked on behavior modification . Break time instead of going out and smoking I now take  two laps around my building. "
"Smoked for 14 years. Was smoking a pack and a half when I finally quit. I haven't smoked for around 3 years now. I quit because my 6 year old son said to me, ""Daddy, don't smoke because you'll die and I won't have a daddy any more"". I used the nicotine patch. The patch was the only thing I could use to really get me to quit for the long term. You really do need to use it for the recommended length of time. I needed about 2-3 months without smoking to be able to go without the patch. The more I got used to not smoking, the easier it was for me to forget about it. I also tried the e-cig and it didn't work for me.If you use e-cigs to quit cigarettes, I suggest not using ones that look and feel like a cigarette. The less reminders you have about cigarettes, the better. Also, don't hang out with smokers too much when you first quit. "
"My mom smoked for as long as I can remember and I'm 17 about to be 18. She bought an ecig and chantx and quit in a couple of months. She's coming up on 2 years since the last time she smoked. 
EDIT:  My mom doesn't house her ecig anymore either. The same thing happened with my sister. She's smoked since about 16 and she's 27 and stopped smoking around the time my mom did, but i don't think she had chantx "
"Easiest thing for me? After college, I moved back in with family. Considering the fact my family is incredibly against smoking, it wasn't hard with constant support from loved ones. I still find I hit a cigarette on the weekends when I'm out with friends, but that might be once a month. I've next to no hunger for them now, and I plan on my next outing to ignore them completely."
"COLD TURKEY ISNT FOR EVERYONE. It's better to ween yourself off. I used to smoke analogs and then switched to electronic cigarettes almost 2 years ago. It's so much better. Granted it's not good for you either, but it is exponentially better for you and those around you than traditional cigarettes. While cigarettes have a laundry list of additives and chemicals, electronic cigarettes only have two, propylene glycol (it's used in ice cream and other foods as well as fog machines which if you've ever been to a big production concert, haunted house etc. you breathe in plenty of it) and vegetable glycerin. There is a MASSIVE selection of flavors to chose from and most of them taste exactly as advertised. 
Here's the best part though: the nicotine level is CUSTOMIZABLE. Meaning one week you can have 24mg, then the next have 18mg, then the next 12mg and the next 8mg until you are down to zero, then it's just a matter of time before you kick the mouth asphyxiation all together. 
I would head over to /r/electronic_cigarette for more info. 
I got a great deal on a pair of Kangertech EVODs. A little more work with them because you have to add the juice manually, but you save a shit ton of money ($40) for two and the juice and coil packs are cheap and last a long time (2-3 days charge and a coil will last you at least a week for one and a pack comes with 5). 
I hope this doesn't get buried but I would definitely look into this man it has helped so many people quit and is the easiest and cheapest route to take!"
"This is how it went for me:  I was having a real bad day.  I had no money, I had no cigarettes.  I just thought to myself ""This bad day is getting even worse just because I want a cigarette, why am I even doing this?""  That was it, I stopped right there.  I just stopped putting cigarettes in my mouth.  When I wanted one, too bad, suck it up and get over it.  I relapsed once and started smoking again when I started dating a girl who smoked.  She ended up getting pregnant and quitting smoking which made it easier for me to quit again and I haven't smoked since.  That was 4 years ago.  I had a smoke one time out of spite when my gf and I were fighting.  I threw up about six times after that and felt so sick for the entire day.  You just have to want to quit.  There are no secrets.  Just stop putting cigarettes in your mouth.  Stop doing it today and never do it again.  You will never regret it."
"Smoking Cessation Hypnosis.  Without question, the best $300.00 I've ever spent.  
I started smoking in college.  I knew I was addicted within the first few weeks, but I was partying a lot and it didn't bother me.  BUT, I also knew I'd need to quit someday so I promised myself I'd never smoke past age 30.
So, 30 gets closer and closer and even though I ""quit"" successfully over and over, it never lasted more than six months.  So I went to a guy in Phoenix for a 60-minute smoking cessation session.  Ironically, as I was handing him credit card I was thinking ""What a f-ing rip off, I'm going to go buy a pack on the way home.""  
But for whatever reason, I didn't.  I didn't the next day too.  IDK if it was him, me getting sick of smoking, the promise, or what.  But I didn't smoke after that day.  That was 4 years ago."
"I've never smoked, but: Has anyone here tried going on a low-carb diet and stopping smoking at the same time?
My idea is that the diet has worked well for me because it slows bacteria that normally would send out signals to make me hungry, to feed the bacteria. 
If my idea is correct, it's possible that bacteria also influence other addictions or compulsions, and that a low-carb diet (or probiotics, or antibiotics, or something else that influences bacteria) could make it easier (or harder) to give up smoking. 
"
"A few different variables lined up for me. I'm an asthmatic so I knew smoking was extra stupid for me. I was really sick at the time causing even further decreased respiratory function, so I could hardly even get smoke into my lungs. My mother bought me the medium strength patches and I just knew it was now or never. That was 3 years ago on Dec. 27. Tobacco is wack yo."
"""Seeing my sister die of lung cancer""
Is what my mother-in-law told me when I asked her that question.
"
Sinus. After a while you actually want to breathe and live 
Have you tried a vaporiser? It's worked for me for 7 months and counting! 
"Every morning when you wake up say to yourself, ""I'm not going to smoke today."" In other words, take it one day at a time. It makes it easier. Reward yourself ay the end of each week with a nice dinner or something to help encourage your quitting."
"I started using a cheap ecig with menthol flavor and quit buying cigarettes entirely. I would cheat now and again and try one and found them disgusting. I still do.If you quit long enough I believe you'll begin to detest the flavor like I did. I then eventually quit using the ecig except socially because I am lazy and cheap. I would use mint flavor juices because I liked menthol. It was hard and I got bitchy because I smoked for 6 years and hate to tell myself no when I ""need"" something but now I only puff my boyfriend's ecig now and again for fun. I quit regularly smoking last May. I believe it just takes willpower and being actually willing to quit and be proud of the decision. You're making it a bigger deal than it is. Overthinking and obsessing will only make you worry about it."
"A friend, who had quit 10 years before, told me -- ""Just hang onto this idea. In a few weeks, or maybe a month or two, you are going to be at an airport or train station. You will see one of those desperate people, cigarette in hand, frantically looking for an exit or a smoking area. And you'll think, 'How pathetic. I am glad I don't let The Man string me out anymore.'"" And in a couple of months, I noticed just that.  "
"Smokers bronchitis. Couldn't take a puff without blood and pain. Stopped cold turkey, and haven't smoked for the last six years. No temptation to either. "
"I hope you will read this, and sorry if anyone posted this before in this thread but here is my method ; 
Read the book "" easy way to quit smoking by allen carr"". This helped me , my SO and some friends of me to stop smoking as soon as your done reading it. Its amazing. "
The electronic cig. Works wonders and you can do it even inside your house!
"A good electronic cigarette setup. The gas station Blu brand will do nothing to keep you off it, but there's a lot of great smaller devices that are re-chargeable, re-fillable, and easy to use.
Here's my recommendation for a great set up:
* Innokin iTaste V3 Battery **$35-50**
* Kanger Mini Protank **$15**
* eLiquid from vendors like FuzionVapor, The Vapor Chef, Mount Baker Vapor **Price will vary depending on vendor/size**
The nice thing about the Innokin iTaste v3 is that you can charge and use it at the same time, so you won't be stranded with a dead battery and have the urge to smoke. Also, the eliquid thing is a great way to keep on the wagon, because there's so many great vendors out there with great flavors -- you'll want to keep trying different flavors!
With the Kanger Mini Tank, you'll need to replace the atomizer heads every now and then, but it's easy. Just get a 5-pack to have on hand.
Word of advice, forego the tobacco flavored eliquids for a while, most of them are pretty bad. The best bet is if you **have** to have a tobacco flavor is an RY4.
Good luck!"
10 days at a vipassana meditation centre
Book: Alan carr. Made me realize what was the mechanism behind my habit...
"I tried several different methods over a year to quit. First I tried Cold Turkey and aversion (you know, snapping a rubber band on your wrist when you get the craving). But what finally did it for me was nicotine replacement through patches, and all of the tic-tacs. 
Once I was effectively weened off of cigarettes, I had a hard time with the urge to smoke again here and there, and did relapse a few times. I honestly think it was more of an oral fixation... Anyway, I finally bought one of those electronic cigarettes with the liquids you add yourself. I haven't had a cigarette since, and the best part is I have been gradually lowering the nicotine concentration (my goal is to get to zero by the end of this year). "
"I AM NOT A SMOKER.  I want to get that out of the way up front.  I know three people that I would classify as chain smokers that have all successfully given up cigarettes by switching to an electronic cigarette.  They don't use the disposable kind you see at gas stations, they have the bigger ones that you carry around with you wherever.  My one buddy has a clip for it like a pen, and just always has it in his pocket.  Anyway, they all said that switching was seamless and they don't miss cigarettes.  Considering that everything I hear on them is that basically there are no adverse health effects, if you want to quit cigarettes, but not necessarily smoking, it looks to be an effective alternative.  Hopefully smokers that have switched to ecigs as well will chime in and give their two cents.  Like I said, I am NOT a smoker.  I do know that you can smoke them indoors which is a big plus for a lot of people. Good luck!"
"If you can swing it, go on a week-long vacation to someplace exciting.  It sounds like with you, as with me, smoking is very tied to location and routine.  I quit while on a week-long vacation with my fiancee to Italy.  Don't rationalize it that quitting while on vacation will ruin your vacation.  I was in a new location, exciting new stuff happening every day, I almost didn't think about it.  My fiancee also gave me an ultimatum more or less, which also helped with the motivation (she's awesome).
You'll still have cravings after you get back, but it will be much easier with a week under your belt.  Good luck."
"get your wisdom teeth out and then realize that you are turning into a big dirty piece of shit who has no more money in college. Make the decision to no longer be under the curse of cig smoking and put your mind to it. find another hobby. just don't go out and buy another pack
"
"I quit drinking for a couple months to prove to myself that I could. The second I was to crack my first beer, I told myself I would never smoke again. I love beer that much. Over five years cigarette free."
Mockery from my friends.  
The thing that helped me was electronic cigarette. When I was drinking I always wanted a cigarette mainly it was a hand thing. I had to be doing something with my hands and that helped me quit for 5 years now. Slowly I just got the mindset that I didn't need it. I loved waking up in the morning being able to breath and not having my mouth taste like a ashtray. Good luck. 
"chantix worked for me...  some crazy side effects which include ""night terrors"" and ""objects floating in eye"" but none as awful as the certain death my doctor warned me about with smoking (family history of heard disease).  Besides, the night terrors that i experienced were usually post apocalyptic in nature, very lucid, and lots of fun IMO.  The drug basically made my cravings much much shorter, so when i wanted a smoke, all i had to do was wait it out for about 5 min, and I would pretty much forget I ever wanted one."
I quit cold turkey over a year now. But I started smoking while i was drinking. So i quit drinking at the same time. Ill have a beer here and there for the tastes but Im nit out getting drunk anymore. So basically i saw drinking as my biggest doorway to smoking.
"Okay so. I have tried about every method of quitting. However I never really truly wanted to quit. No one depends on me, I'm not scorned for it, I have good health. What I found is that its not even cigarettes for me it is simply the act of smoking. Snus, gum, patches, nothing helped with the craving. So I went to e-cigs for a moment went back to cigs then found e-cigs again. What I want when I smoke is to FEEL it in my throat and lungs, so I got a variable voltage e-cig cranked that bitch up and put a 30/70 pg/vg juice in it. Its rough and I enjoy the everliving shit out of it - moreso than any cigarette. Its rough on your throat but not damaging, you can literally smoke it whenever, no more smelling like shit, and you save a metric dick load of money. Best two options in my book: e-cig or discipline "
"I too chose a date to quit smoking, and got some non-tobacco smoking herbs (damiana & mullein) that I used to roll and smoke spliffs for a couple months afterwards.
About a week before my quit date I came down with the worst sinus infection I've ever had, and was stuck in bed for about two weeks. I did not want to eat or move, much less smoke anything. 
I credit that sinus infection for making the process much easier than it could have been. 4  or so years smoke-free now :)"
"Electronic cigarette mods worked great for me but I really wanted to quit. They reproduced the tactile gratification that I got from smoking tobacco. Now I don't use anything for smoking.
I immediately noticed a difference in my health. I didn't get sick as easily. I noticed a difference in my disposition. I wasn't near as much of a dick as before. Down side, I did have to battle a weight gain but it was worth it."
"I quit smoking cold turkey because I should have known better, and should not have smoked at all. Think about how much it stinks, what it does to the air quality of the people around you, etc. 
All I did was slowly finish my pack and that was that... never went back. It doesn't matter if you crave one every once in a while, you don't NEED cigarettes, so you can live without them."
"Smoked for 24 years, I am now 1 month smoke free. I didn't use anything I just knew I had to quit, cold turkey is hard, but worth it.."
"Here's what I suggest before starting cold turkey. Find the nastiest, cheapest cigarettes you can find. If you hate menthol, use menthol. Then smoke those for your last pack of cigarettes. The nasty flavor will stick with you, and will diminish your cravings, since your most recent memory of the taste of cigarettes is nastiness."
"I had to go through a lot of attempts. After 20 years of smoking, a combination of Zyban/Welbutrin and electronic cigarettes broke the cycle.   I know this sounds odd, but try and quit right after/during a sinus/respiratory infection.  You don't want to smoke when you are sick  and it will help you get through the nic fits.  "
Cold turkey all the way. Granted I don't have an addictive personality and I've always been able to just walk away from cigarettes. The patches and gum have never worked for any of my friends. My dad bought an e-cig and that was the closest hes come to quitting.
"i accidentally smoked a cigarette with a tobacco grub in it, heavy vomiting, never smoked since (smoked for 10 years)"
JalapeÌ±o peppers. I carried a medicine bottle with them in it. Whenever I got a craving I'd pop one in my mouth. It will make you forget about cigarettes in a hurry. 
"I switched to electric cigars. You will get arteriosclerosis aswell, yet there are known cancerogenes in the steam. So I chose a very comfortable way which is probably not the best."
"A promise I made to myself.
I'm 30 days tobacco free as of today."
"I switched to dip.  Copenhagen.  I was smoking two packs a day, my lungs were all burned up.  I couldn't exercise or even walk up a flight of stairs without hurting.  And I couldn't just quit. So I started dipping.  For a few months i dipped and reduced my smoking, down from 40 Newports a day to 5-10 a day.  Then i just forced myself to dip only.  I understand that it's not good for me either but it feels great to be able to breathe again.  Not to mention I'm saving money. And I'm losing weight because exercise isn't such a horrible feeling.   I was certain that smoking was going to kill me. I had to do something."
"In Miami the Vapor Shark brand of electronic cigarettes is very popular. I smoke this now instead of real cigarettes. I quit smoking regular cigarettes as soon as I started the electronic one. Don't do both or you're not really helping yourself. The e-liquid can be ordered without nicotine or with any amount really. I found it helpful to spend some time in a e-cigarette store where they let you try out the different flavors. Don't just go with what you think will taste good.  Try them all out. Hopefully if you find something you enjoy, the cigarettes will be less appealing. I personally find nothing appealing about cigarettes anymore and haven't had one in 8 months. "
"Since I had other 12 step experience, I found [Nicotine Anonymous](http://nicotine-anonymous.com) via [Nicanon]( http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/unofficialnicanon/info) and [Voices of Nicotine Recovery]( http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/voicesofnicotinerecovery/info) to be helpful.  I have relapsed since, and stopped attending the online meetings held several times a day, but it is a successful support group program as long as you stick to the program.  12 Step Programs work when you  work them. 
Edit: their approach is ""smobriety"", which is pretty much cold turkey, but you reach out to the group and share with them when you are willing the cravings and just have to get through the day. "
"I was smoking 30-40 roll ups every day since i was 18. I am now 32. December 4th 2013 i was prescribed champix and on dec 18th i had my last cigarette. I just didn't want one. I thoroughly recommend these tablets. It is a 12 week course. It cost me å£7.50 every two weeks. Apologies for typos, on shitty phone."
"I went on vacation with my parents as an adult (23 years old and roughly 5 years into my habit). After sneaking out at the airport for one last puff before the plane showed up, I just threw my pack of cigs in the garbage and got on board. My plan was to buy some more once we checked into the hotel and go for long walks alone to get my nicotine as needed. 
Quickly into the vacation I realized that this was not a good strategy and it would be counterproductive to the concept of a family vacation if I was constantly lying to sneak out and smoke. After 5 days with my family I realized that they were far more important to me than my drug. Eventually our vacation brought us to Las Vegas, which before I had gone cold turkey would have been an absolute nicotine haven for me. Indoor smoking? All the booze you could want? Count me in!
Once I got there, I realized how much more I could smell the cigarettes as a nusiance. Watching all of the people glued to their slot machines and sucking their life through their cigs as they gambled away their income really solidified the idea in my head of what these little death sticks were doing to me. I've never even had an urge to pick up another pack of those things since.
Oh and weed. That helped a lot. "
"I suffered a traumatic brain injury - memory loss, physical therapy to walk right again...all from a head injury - I lit up a smoke right after impact (i was kind of in shock) smoked the rest of the day. When my ""bed ridden phase"" began, I simply never smoked again - its been nearly 2 yrs now. No patch - no nicotine gum or anything. So i dont suggest a head injury, but its funny how the brain works. "
I decided I wanted to be healthier more than I wanted a cig. I cheated now and then fir a while. But eventually I was able to see just how terrible they are for you. And now its a very rare for me to even think about smoking.
Ecig.  I smoked for 6 years; then one day I tried an electronic cigarette and never looked back. It's been almost a year now since I last smoked a cigarette. 
"I tried the e-cigarettes.  Those did not work.  I went back to smoking.  However, when I switched to a actual VAPOR e-cig that you fill with liquid..that worked great for me.  I currently use [Kanger Evod Starter Kit](http://www.kangeronline.com/products/kanger-e-vod-starter-kit) with [Halo Vapor](http://www.halocigs.com/) and it's a huge difference.  The e-cigarettes like the Blu, SafeCig, etc did nothing.  However, the actual vaporizors helped me quit the habit fast.  
**It's good to note these still provide nicotine, but you can lower the levels till you hit zero like a nicotine patch.  These are not made to help you quit, but you can use them and it worked for me."
"I was a smoker for 5 years and recently quit for New Year's Resolutions, I haven't had a cigarette this year yet.  Cold turkey is absolutely the best way to go, but you can't just 'go cold turkey' all the sudden, it probably won't work.  
What many people don't realize is that you actually start to quit smoking while you're still smoking.  This is exactly your situation OP, you've tried 5 times to quit.  You probably don't even tell people when you're planning to quit any more, because you haven't the past 4 times, and to them you're digging for compliments or crying wolf.  That's okay, I believe you're more than halfway through the road to quitting.
The first thing that happens is you consider quitting.  You could be reflecting on how long you've been smoking, the benefits you'd enjoy if you quit, or the smokey smell that's becoming an ever-more permanent part of your identity - no matter what the impetus, something will plant the 'seed of quit' in your mind.  BUT, you won't quit at this point, *and that's okay*.  
Once the seed is sewn, you'll either a) accept the fact that quitting smoking can only be a good thing, or b) make compromises to yourself that disqualify or override the reasons why you should quit.  In all likelihood you'll go with choice B, *and that's okay*.
It might take a week, a month, or a few years in this stage.  Your mind will subconsciously test those mental compromises and break them down one by one, until one day you wake up and feel **obligated** to have your morning cigarette, rather than **content** to have it. This is where you need to spring into action.  Cultivate that feeling, force yourself to smoke even if you don't want to.  Build up resentment towards the habit.  Then, pick a date a week or two into the future that is the day to quit.  It's almost like you're committing suicide as a smoker, once you pick that date, you'll feel a lot better about quitting.  This will only work if you've built that resentment towards the habit, however, so if you're not at this stage yet, keep on building the hate.  This is the same technique that my grandparents used on my mom when they found out she wanted to smoke, they forced her to smoke 10 cigarettes in a row, and it quelled her desire.
Think of something you enjoyed to do before you were a smoker.  This will be your reward for going a series of hours or a full day without smoking.  For me, it was either exercise or weed.  Your quit date will come, and you might even have a cigarette on that day, *and that's okay*.  You'll consider those few puffs, that last cigarette, or even the last two cigarettes as a last hurrah before your voyage.  It will be sentimental and you should experience nostaligia, like 'I remember now, this is what it was like to smoke'.  Because in your mind, you've already quit.  This last cigarette might as well be your first cigarette, because *you don't smoke*.
However you won't start the habit, like you did with your first cigarette, because you have months or years of contemplating quitting and all that evidence built up against the habit.  Instead you'll chuckle at your naive past self, and eagerly look forward to a smoke-free life as a wiser person.
Now, you may break down and have a puff or two during the next two weeks.  This will usually happen around your strongest trigger, which for most people is a person (who smokes, and who you used to smoke with).  You might want to try avoiding that person for two weeks.  Tell them it isn't personal, or just drop off the earth, they'll understand.  If it's your S.O. this will be especially difficult, but be strong for them.  They probably want to quit too, so be strong and don't give in.  Be the good example that they can follow, it'll make quitting so much easier on them.
You'll notice after a week that you're starting to feel happier, randomly, for no aparent reason.  This is your mind re-wiring its dopamine channels to activate when you do certain things, like pay a bill on time, see a beautiful sunrise, or get positive feedback from someone at work.  This is the biggest thing that people don't realize when they smoke - for smokers, having a cigarette is the only thing that makes them feel good, even if they do tons of other things that should make them feel good.  Once they stop smoking, they start to feel happier and more confident.  You look at yourself and feel good about what you do on a daily basis, rather than feeling good after having a cigarette, which happens on a daily basis.
Another quick tip:  It also helps to quit in the physical location where you started.  It's almost like you're un-doing this habbit, starting by quitting where you started.
This whole process that took me 3 years, *more than half of the time that I was a smoker*, so it certainly doesn't happen overnight. It takes time, but in the end, the only thing that will make you quit is *you*.  The patch, nicotine gum and e-cigarettes won't help you quit, it'll only put you in a werid limbo where you're not happy because you can't have a real cigarette, and you're not happy because you're still a smoker.
**TL;DR: You need to be the one to make yourself quit, not quitting products, and the process begins while you're still smoking.**"
"I smoked for about 15 years, I started smoking only when I drank or went to parties, but by the time I was 25 I was smoking a pack or more a day, taking frequent smoke brakes at work and home. Being single I would go out to bars a couple of night s a week and smoke at least a pack a night while drinking. I quit by going cold turkey and running. I seriously tried to quit about 12 times I even made it a few months one of the times, but when I would go to a bar or hang out with another smoker I would end up relapsing. I tried the gum one time but that made it worse, when I picked back up again I started smoking more than I did before the gum. E-cigarettes, gums and patches are meant to ween you off the physical addiction but they don't help with the emotional tie to smoking. I really liked smoking, even though I haven't had a cigarette in 7 years I still miss the smoke breaks. I replaced my smoking addiction with a running and work out addition. I didn't purposefully quit drinking and going out to bars, but it I did quit drinking for about 4 months and I attribute being able to quit smoking to running, quitting drinking, and instead of going for smoke breaks at work I walked up and down 20 flights of stairs. "
I bought a sports car. I couldn't afford smokes and the car payments. 13 years stopped cold turkey
"Negative association worked for me.
I wasn't necessarily a 'pack-a-day' smoker, but I had a tendency to smoke much more whenever I went out drinking or hung out with other smokers.  The morning after some of these serious benders were the worst-- I had MASSIVE hangovers and really couldn't function for a good part of the day due to the pain.  I mostly attributed this pain to all the smoking that I did.  During some of these hangover days it felt like my lungs ached to the point where I would decide not to smoke that day.  
Eventually when I thought about quitting I decided to extend my 'break' to the next day.  The next day then turned into the rest of the week.  I felt really good about it so I kept it rolling through the rest of the month, eventually quitting for a whole year.
Now, mind you there were maybe one or two days/nights where I did bum from a friend and cheated.  In the long run though, I was able to successfully associate smoking with the wretchedness my body felt during hangovers and lay off for extended periods of time.
I know it sounds so trite, but take quitting one day at a time and make it a goal to keep it rolling.  You can do it!"
"Will power man. It's the only thing will actually help you quit.  I tried quitting many times an kept failing. One day I just said fuck it as didn't smoke another cig. 
One thing that helped me a lot was the app My Last Cigarrette. Sounds dumb but shows you how many cigs you haven't smoked and how many people have died since you quit. Gives a ton of information. I'd def spend the dollar on it. "
"I've had several successful quits (over a year without lighting up). I'm currently on 13 months. 
All nicotene replacement failed for me. 
Zyban was extremely helpful. It made smoking less satisfying and reduced anxiety during the quit.
Herbal cigarettes were helpful. It allowed me to replace the ritual of lighting up and taking a break. Be warned, however, they smell awful and even other smokers will shun your second hand smoke.
Grit and guts were a requirement. It's fricking hard and you have to focus on quitting. Nothing, nothing you can do is going to make it easy to quit smoking. It's going to be the hardest thing you've ever done, no matter how many tricks, hacks, gimmicks, and remedies you make use of.
Know that once you get over 3 days, it starts to get easier. Don't waste a day of a quit with a slip up. After a week, you won't have to think about quitting 24 hours a day. After two weeks, your routine cravings will be just about gone. After a month, you might have a whole day where you don't think about smoking. After six months, all you have to do is remember you're an addict and not be a fuck up who tries one for fun.
I looked at the pictures of an emaciated man on his death bed at whyquit.org. Dying of cancer, a six-month old picture of a robust version of his skeletal self on the night stand, holding his child. Right next to his pack of marlboros. He quit when he was too close to death to be summon the energy to light up. Yup. I stared at that picture a lot when I was thinking about smoking."
"When my wife got pregnant, she quit cold turkey.  Naturally she didn't want me to continue smoking so I quit with her.  The motivation brought on by your kids (future or existing) is amazingly powerful.  We had tried many times to quit in the past with varying results, never lasting more than a couple months.  We are now almost 3 years smoke free."
"you have to want to!  I just stopped and am using the eGo-C Twist electronic.  I use the tobacco flavor and also some other flavors to mix up a little bit.  It seems like I use the ecig a lot more than I did regular smokes, but I don't really have a craving for a regular cigarette anymore "
"Former smoker of 10 years ,  the prescription pill Champix made it ridiculously easy to quit .  1 and a half prescriptions , roughly 3 weeks which included the first 10 days of me smoking as per normal.   If you cant quit with this method,  deep down inside you dont want to quit smoking. "
"I quit in 2008. Prior to that I was smoking about 2 packs a day, and had been for many years. The only thing that worked, unfortunately, was cold turkey and determination. The patch, the gum... these things just pull the bandaid off so slowly. 
I started chewing a LOT of sunflower seeds, and that helped take the edge off because at least it gave my mouth something to do. 
Quitting was the hardest thing I've ever done, but God damn if it isn't worth it. Another thing I did was start jogging. My lungs healed quickly and it felt like I was gaining super powers being able to run further and further. 
Don't ever stop trying. I don't ever even think about smoking anymore, quitting was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Good luck. "
"Hi, RN here, I'd like to add to what everyone else is saying, it sounds like the most effective method for the community is to quit cold turkey, and that sounds about right.  After all, other methods like nicotine patches just replace the dependence, and it sounds like you want to get rid of it.  I understand that the anxiety related to quitting can be a lot, so I recommend you try to find a coping mechanism that helps distract you from the anxiety, and use it whenever you feel the kick.  Also, you might consider asking your doctor about a mild anti-anxiety medication like Zyban (AKA Wellbutrin), the cool thing about this medication is there is unlike other medications there are usually no side effects and it does not form dependence, it can help with the anxiety, however the most important tool is motivation, find what motivates you and use it."
"The most effective method for me was avoiding other smokers.  
I had started out by not buying packs and relied on throwing a dollar or so at my smoker buddies every time I wanted to smoke - but I found myself just getting broke faster.  After that, I just stopped hanging around the smoking area at work.  
Cold turkey + avoiding my social smoking trigger did it for me."
"What started the process for me was switching to making my own with pipe tobacco.  You'd be surprised how many addictive chemicals are in regular, brand-name cigarettes.  Gradually, my smoking went down, until in August I was finally able to quit for good.  I don't miss it, either, even when my husband lights up."
"I'm sure it's been said, but Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking worked for me. I've been 14 months without a cigarette. The book really helped put my mind in the right place to make an honest effort at quitting. 
That being said, having my spouse quitting with me was a big factor as well. Not having another smoker in the house made it infinitely easier. 
Good luck! "
"I just stopped buying a pack ... helped me
"
"I quit around 3 years ago, from a 20 a day habit. Tried the cold turkey method and ended up a nasty piece of work, to be honest i wasn't too bothered about quitting, the Mrs had recently quit and was now a martyr for stopping! 
I got on the subject with a colleague at work who had at that point stopped smoking for 3-4 months.
He quit using a drug available on the NHS called Champix, so the day after i called my surgery and asked to be seen.
It was explained how the drug works, that i'd still smoke whilst taking the tablets, that i'd be required to visit the doctors once every 2 weeks for a further prescription and that i should be smokes free within 12 weeks...sounds good! 
So the program began. It took around 3 weeks for a noticeable change, i lit up one morning, inhaled and didn't get the usual feeling of satisfaction...by the end of the second packet of tablets i was lighting a cigarette, inhaling once or twice and then putting it out as there was just no point in smoking it all.
I decided that i'd try and quit at the end of the 5th week, by the end of the 6th week i'd not lit up, id twiddled quite a few pens but never lit up.
4th visit to the doc's, explained that i'd not smoked in a week and was advised that i should get a 4th prescription and try to cut the dose down by half... by the 7th week i'd still not lit up so began weening.
8th week done, down to 1/4 dose and still had a few pills left...so i decided no more Champix.
Safe to say i have never looked back, never once missed smoking, can be around other smokers.
Certainly wasn't that difficult!

I used to smoke a pack a day and going for more. Until I found Sweet mary jane. Every time I would get a craving I would take a massive hit and the cravings dissapear instantly. I did that for about a week and now I cant even take the smell of a cigarette now.
"The best I did for me was educating myself about the effects when quitting.
The addiction response is often too painful for smokers to endure--which is absolutely NUTS NUTS NUTS, in my opinion. The very reason that you CONTINUE to smoke is the addiction response. You continue to smoke BECAUSE it's more stressful to quit. As if smoking is relieving any actual stress, smokers have been convinced they feel more comfortable by smoking. THIS IS WRONG. Smokers are constantly being made more and more UNCOMFORTABLE because of the addiction. If it weren't for addiction, you wouldn't have constant headaches, increased irritability, or negative emotions like sadness (as often). You continue to smoke because the addiction response is being activated EVERY SINGLE DAY.
As a smoker, EVERY DAY is about enduring and relieving withdrawal symptoms. As a quitting smoker, one to two months are about enduring somewhat stronger withdrawal symptoms. The payoff is worth the sacrifice of comfort, because the comfort after quitting is much better than the ""comfort"" one gets by smoking.
The addiction equation is this:
Smoker needs a certain amount of nicotine at any given moment. Their nicotine levels are always dropping. As the levels drop, the body gets a little stressed out. As levels continue dropping, the stress intensity increases. They will stress more and more until they smoke. Once they smoke, the levels are replenished and the body is less stressed. Immediately, the levels begin to drop again, and the body begins to stress again. Until they smoke, the body will become more and more stressed.
After quitting, you immediately have more spending income. Your senses become more reliable. You smell is less repulsive to other people, making you more approachable. You're less stressed out because you're not going through withdrawal every single day.
All of these quitting side effects are temporary, and life after this is much improved over the painful life of chronic smoking addiction. "
"The doctor telling me that for the next month after skull base surgery, a single drag could kill me. 
Seriously, though, cold turkey's the only way. You're on a 30-day purge after your last drag. Any new drag, e-cig or analog, starts the countdown over. 
Find resilience and take each craving at a time. They'll last about 30 minutes at first, but they'll slowly get shorter and farther between. Godspeed. "
"I had to keep several reasons to remind myself: 1.) My father was one of the strongest and finest men I've known; the chemicals the cigarette companies slathered on this piece of paper with some weeds and a filter was so incredibly addictive, in his case, it killed him. 2.) I wanted to be an Example to my son in being able to overcome something, even though it was difficult (and I never smoked in the home - he would check on me outside, though) 3.) Determination: Even though it took me several times to quit for good; I forgave myself for falling off and the next time I was more determined to not allow Big Tobacco to win.
I had quit for 2 years once and an evening at a bar with friends I thought I could just have 'one'; was a year and a half after that 'one' before I quit again. 3.) Saw other long term smokers (especially women) and was horrified that my mouth would end up looking like my anus (vanity). 4.) Was also disgusted after quitting and realizing that I had smelled like a combination of a dirty ashtray and vomit when I smoked; a smell that a smoker doesn't smell when they are addicted - but everyone else does. I had tried several methods, including cold turkey (brutal); the patch helped me most. The e-cigs were not out when I was quitting; but those have helped my sister (one who would not even discuss quitting prior).  I have not smoked cigs for over 9 years now and am SO grateful to be free of that addiction. Please, keep trying, it is so worth it. Don't let those companies who addicted you win by killing off another good person. Others need you and you CAN do it. Just remember, however strong those urges are; they usually only last a couple of minutes: breathe deep, go for a walk, get through it. And, yes, things will happen the day you quit that will challenge you; mainly because you have to relearn to do almost everything - including dealing with emotions - BUT it is so worth it and the urges WILL pass. Good luck and I'm cheering for you.

Moving from where the price of a pack was $3 to somewhere it was $10+. 
Nicotine lozenges
"Cold turkey. It sounds so simplistic, but I finally managed to quit 8 months ago by just telling myself that is was just no longer an option. If you can say to yourself that cigarettes just don't exist for you anymore, you stop thinking of them as part of your life. It's hard as hell, but WAY easier than the illnesses and risks that come with being a smoker. Good luck!"
"Ecigarettes, yes I know I'm replacing one vice for another. I'm happy with it though"
"2 things worked in combination.  Started bumming my friend's American Spirit mediums.  Revolting.  Couldn't take more than a drag before I became nauseous.  Got conditioned Clockwork Orange style.  
Then, I moved to LA.  People only smoke in their own cars.  It's just not around.  
Had no intention of quitting really.  It just went away by itself."
Getting pregnant. Quitting was pretty easy once I knew. Smoked for 12 years but always said I'd quit if I got pregnant so that was that. 
"First off, wtf is wrong with your work/insurance? You only get a break if you smoke? Idk where you are, but that's gotta be a labor law violation. And what kind of health insurance gives people incentive to smoke? Fucked up.
Anyway, to answer your question, I have two triggers I've identified: falling out with a SO, and like you, work makes me crave.
Cold turkey worked well for me once, I quit for three years (until a breakup with a SO, a few bummed smokes on nights of heavy drinking and I was back in the habit). The first month was absolute hell, for me and everyone around me I'm sure, but after that it was smooth sailing.
This time around I'm using an e-cig. What kind of e-cig rig are you set up with? Maybe you need a stronger nicotine concentration? I didn't like Blu (the brand that kinda looks like an actual cig), so I got a rig with the battery and refillable chamber & mouthpiece. I had to shop around to find some juices strong enough where I like the flavor. I bought my rig four months ago and haven't craved an analog cigarette since. My advantage to you here is I can vape at work, so I don't even have to step outside to puff.
Also, find something to do to keep your hands/mind busy when you have a craving, a lot of my smoking habit was reinforced by the ritual of smoking. Find something productive and/or healthy: jog around the block (you CAN if you're not a smoker). Peel a banana and eat it. Knit a scarf for 10 minutes. Give yourself an alternative addiction, something that won't make you feel sick and guilty, but rather healthy and accomplished."
"I've been smoking the e-cigs (vaporizors, not those shitty plastic cigarettes) for over a year now."
"ECIG. Smoked 17 a day. Havent smoked in 3 years. I vape all the time though :P
Try the ""EGO"" or ""Riva"" Starter packs with BOGE low resistance atomizers...its the simplest way to go"
Getting bronchitis.
"I used to work with a guy that always gave me smokes, like 4 or 5 a day.  Then I quit that job.  "
Which Electronic Cigarette do you have? 
"I stopped buying them. pack and a half a day to 0, going 14 months and strong. It sucked for the first month sure, but if I didn't buy them, I couldn't smoke them. My laziness won over my addiction. Side benefit, after a month I figured 'well shit if I can quit smoking I can lose weight too' and thanks to keto and some exercise, I've lost 130lbs. From 335 to 205, hooray."
"Read the book 'the easy way to stop smoking' by Allen Carr. The guy has actual centers throughout Europe. His success rate is phenomenal, just look at the ratings on Amazon:D Can't explain why it works, it just does!"
"I'd be amazed if it's not already mentioned somewhere else in this thread, but a year ago when my wife got pregnant with my son, I was *strongly urged* to quit smoking. I was smoking a pack or two a day and even if I did it when she wasn't around the smell would linger and make her nauseas.. So, I *upgraded* to ecigs, or as I prefer to call it, vaping.
Those shitty little cigarette looking devices they sell at the gas station, IMHO, are complete garbage. I went all out and got some mid-high end gear and couldn't be happier. I can adjust the pull, the temperature, the amount of vapor, the amount of nicotine to be juuuuust right. I can set it to fog out my car with just a couple puffs, in case you were thinking that they are all too puny and won't quench your cravings. I've got some delicious flavors that smell and taste wonderful.. But best of all, my cough is GONE and I can notice a HUGE difference in my health. My lung capacity has skyrocketed and my sense of smell and taste sometimes make me feel like a werewolf. Me and my clothes don't stink, and I now find cigarettes smell abysmal and taste like an ashtray. Since vaping doesn't have the thousands of carcinogenic compounds found in cigs, I've found that there was something else in those Marlboros aside from nicotine that was making me crave them so bad. I used to only be able to go 20-30 minutes before needing to light up again, now I can easily spend a whole work day without even thinking about it.
TLDR: Vaping/ecigs have changed my life.. But for me, I needed a powerful, high end device that I could set just right. Don't write them off if you've only tried those crappy gas station specials.."
"I found a wonderful site that helped me understand how nicotine addiction works and gave me the information I needed to finally succeed at a cold turkey quit.  http://www.whyquit.com  There are some great articles and videos, free site no account required.  I started reading during a slow day at work, just to educate myself, and the info was so compelling that I simply threw away 1/2 a pack and have not had a single puff since.  That was 2 1/2 years ago.  "
"They also have links to download a few different quit counter programs/apps.  When I need to feel good about something I just check my stats.
 - Free and Healing for Two Years, Six Months, Twenty Two Days, 20 Hours and 22 Minutes, while extending my life expectancy 97 Days and 16 Hours, by avoiding the use of 28135 nicotine delivery devices that would have cost me $11,713.93."
"Discipline. The patches and gum didn't work for me, so I resorted on quitting cold turkey. It will be 10 months come the first. This may sound like a silly idea, but, I did 40 days of fasting before hand. No eating during the day only after dusk. My mind went crazy trying to convince me things like soup wasn't really food or yogurt wasn't either. After learning how to tell myself no, I became disciplined to my urges and I was able to transfer that discipline over to quitting smoking after those 40 days. Hope that helps and good luck!!"
I got pregnant. It's a lot easier to quit when you have something to quit for.
"Researching the Tobacco Industry. Learning how ammonia is added to reconstituted leaf which basically causes the nicotine to be freebased, making the addiction that much worse. I got mad at the industry and myself for spending so much money on such a useless drug.
I started buying American spirit pipe tobacco and rolling my own because pipe tobacco isn't taxed as much as cigarette rolling tobacco. The American Spirit doesn't have ammonia, so it lessened the nicotine effects. Rolling my own made it more of a chore to smoke. Instead of just whipping out a cigarette and lighting up, I had to spend a minute or more putting the thing together. For the first year, I also cut back heavily on coffee and alcohol since they were almost always accompanied by smoking.
I also started using a combination of a patch and the gum. The gum was something to reach for instead of a cigarette when I got the cravings, after a few minutes I forgot about wanting a cigarette. The patch lessened morning cravings right after waking up. The patch also caused me to have crazy vivid dreams, which I enjoyed for the most part.
I still carry nicorette lozenges with me for when I get really stressed and might think about smoking, especially while driving to and from work. I haven't used any tobacco products in over 2 years at this point, and don't see me going back after all the money I've saved and noticeable health improvements."
"> after a few minutes I forgot about wanting a cigarette.
Interesting how your mind convinces you it's imperative to smoke at any given time and how you feel you ""can't live without it"" then after a few minutes you forget about it entirely. Been there dude. Nicotine is a hell of a drug.
"
"What worked for me was the mantra, ""I haven't quit smoking. I'm just not going to have one today.""
Quitting was strangely terrifying and depressing. But that thought that I'll have one again sometime in the future got me through. It's been 15 years since I quit and I never, ever think about lighting up any more."
"Cold turkey. The only thing that worked. It was hellish for maybe a month, slightly less so for a few more months and by two years I knew I wouldn't go back."
"i had some sort of a bronchial infection with an embarrassing cough...totally humiliating cough. when it began, i would just light up when i finished coughing.  this time, however, people STARED at the fool smoking.  Basta! enough!! cold turkey.... 2 days later, i felt fine.  i found some smokes a few months later and tried one but the magic was gone.... haven't smoked since April, 2007."
"Chantix on the third try.  I think what helped most was that I stopped drinking for a few months beforehand.  Anytime I ever quit and fell back into smoking, that first cig came while drinking.  Been tobacco free for
4 years this April.  My wife quit at the same time and we both quit because she was pregnant.  Not wanting out son around second hand likely helped too."
"I wasn't quite the big smoker but I smoked for about 3 or 4 years half a pack a day (10 cigarettes approximately). The thought of quitting was always not far behind but had not put myself into it. So on one day (1 year and 3 months ago) I just woke up, had no smokes and decided to quit right away. It was really hard but the only thing that help you is to repeat your goal in your head. Seriously there is no magic trick. Only keep up and fight. 
oh and my gf just quitted 2 months ago, the same way!
We are now in complete disgust whenever we smell it :-P
sorry, english isn't my primary language..
KEEEPPP UPPP"
"I'm probably too late to this... but here it is anyway. 
I smoked for more than 10 years, typically more than a pack a day. I tried everything in the world to stop, including patches, gum, Chantix, some weird asian seeds taped to my ears, tapering down, and much more. The best thing for me was to quit cold turkey, with a half a pack sitting on my counter, just staring at me. 
Two things helped this process. First, I quit at night, so by the time I woke up, I already had 8 hours smoke free under my belt. That is mentally important. Second, was leaving that pack of cigarettes on my counter. It made me have easy will power during those first few days. Physically quitting is the easy part, which is why its important to physically stop yourself during those first few weeks to strengthen your mental ability to stop. 
So far, it is been a smooth 3.5 years. Not one setback!
"
"I used an Ecig to quit. Used it for about 3 months, weening the nicotine content of the e-liquid down the whole time. As of 2 weeks ago i've been nicotine free. I still have cravings occasionally but it was a lot easier than i thought it'd be. "
"I promised my future wife I'd quit before we got married. I'm a big on keeping my word. So that, and a full supply of nicotine patches and I no longer smoke. Before this I had smoked for 15 years.
The first week is the hardest. I also pretty much had to give up drinking for a month so I wouldn't fall back on it. 
Water, lots of water too.
"
"Cold Turkey .... Told myself ""Why am I smoking this? It makes me smell bad, taste bad, cost a decent amount of money, and quite honestly hardly makes me feel anything good."" Tried taking 2 weeks off... bought a pack. Smoked a few from it, realized It's happening again, gave away the pack and since then it's been 1.5 years and I think I've had 3 cigs people have offered me... usually say no."
pussy was my motivation. 5 yrs without a cig meow.
"What kind of electronic cig do you have? I had an evod for 7 months but still smoked as much as i used it, than upgraded to a better unit that produced more vapor and allowed me to adjust my hit so to speak. It's bern a wrap since. Using yhe evod was like smoking popsicle sticks compared to my itaste, which is like smoking top notch cigars(not really just a comparison)"
"Ask yourself....how much do I really want to be here? Why am I killing myself? Who made you believe that you were worth so little? Love yourself. 
Source...I smoked for 20 years and have been successfully nicotine free for 1 and a half years now."
"Well, I am less than a year quit but I have not thought about smoking or had even one drag since I quit cold turkey. A lot of people say it doesn't work, but I felt like it was the only way for me. I had been thinking about quitting for the longest time for all the reasons anyone wants to quit, but always kept putting it off for that last cigarette. One day I was having one and started feeling shitty in general, coughed up some nasty shit, and I just realized that it was my last one. I didn't even want to finish it. I just flicked it, went back inside, and crushed and threw out the new [minus one pack] carton I had just bought the day before. I have never been happier."
"I smoked for 16 years.  I am smoke free since Nov 12 2013.  It took patches and gum at the same time.  I also used the e cig when drinking or around people who smoke.  Every day gets easier.  If you fail, just keep trying."
"I know others will burn me at the stake for this, but I quit smokeing useing a personal vaporizer commonly known as an electronic cigarette. Im not talking about a blu kit or anything like that, those are garbage and will turn you completely off of them. The kind folks at r/electronic_cigarette will be able to answer and questions and dispel any myths you might have. Public fear mongering has really hurt the community and put out alot of lies about the products but there is actual scientific studys that have proven them to be less harmful and less carcinogenic than there analog counterparts. If any one has questions about these devices I did a research paper on the subjuct and would be happy to share just lemme know and I will post the link."
"Allen Carr's Easy Way worked wonders for me. I had come to the point in my life where I was embarrassed by any physical activity as well as ashamed to smoke in front of anybody. Let alone financial feasibility. 
I read the book with an open mind. I didn't expect it to be some miracle cure, yet I also didn't think it was a hoax. I followed each of the steps to a ""T"" and have been successful for 1.5 years now. I used to fear craving that dirty cigarette in the future. Now, I still have cravings. It lasts for exactly 5 seconds before I stop thinking about it. And I only get a craving once a week.
It is absurdly easy to get a copy of this book. I had an iPhone at the time and purchased the e-copy. My logic at the time was that it was $10. Cheaper than a pack of smokes (in Canada)!! I thought to myself that if it didnt work, who cares. It would have been like smoking 1 more pack. Little did I know that later on it would be the best 10 bucks I have ever spent. "
[deleted]
I have to disagree with step one. A lot of arguments could have been avoided with my wife if I just never told her I quit.
Worked for me. Switch to e cigs. They will he great for awhile until you get fed up with upkeep. At that point you'll just put them down normally. 
I had a blood clot a couple years ago because smoking constricts your blood vessels. That was a pretty good reason for me.
"I had been at 8-10 cigarettes a day since the 90's. Quit completely in 2011, absolutely no desire to light up again. It was essentially cold turkey, but actually a 2-step process for me. 
I started new job in 2007 and resolved to not smoke at work. It was a very busy job, so I hardly had time to pop out for a drag. This helped to keep my mind off cigs for most of the day, and soon I wasn't even feeling the cravings at work. I still needed one cigarette before work every morning and at least 4-5 every evening (more if I went out for drinks or dinner)
In early 2011, thanks to a various circumstances, I had to go to more parties/ social occasions than usual. Now, my biggest smoke cravings would always happen every time I was out drinking. This meant that over a two-month period I was out smoking, drinking and inevitably hungover very often. Everytime I was hungover, I wouldn't feel like smoking until the evening.
After one particularly bad hangover, I simply couldn't take it anymore (I was already in my early 30s at this point, so maybe age had something to do with it). Even the sight of the  was repulsive for a while. I decided to take this opportunity to quit. I spent more time at work (where I didn't crave cigs anyway) and in the evenings, I would just remind myself of how awful the last hangover felt.
For a few months, the cravings would come back periodically, but they were surprisingly mild. I had braced myself for some serious withdrawal, but I it never came - I guess I was just lucky.
Nowadays, there's no craving at all. I can be around cigarettes and smokers with no problem. "
I got really sick. It was either a bug or a flu and I felt like throwing up when I had a smoke. So after about a week and a bit my urge somehow went away and haven't had a smoke in >2 years.
"A combination of smokes going up to over $10 a pack and me quitting drinking for several months at the same time. 
I had ""quit"" several times before that, and I was fine until I had a beer or two. So I went for two or three months without any drinks, and I was able to quit. Still wasn't easy, but it was nice to finally have a beer again and not get a huge craving for a smoke. "
"Champix
awesome pill!
"
"Exercise combined with electronic cigs, patches and gum. The latter helped me cut down and distance smoking from certain activities. And believe it or not, nicotine was easier to quit than whatever other crap it is that they put in cigarettes. 
Exercise provided much of the motivation, I was doing sets and reps that weren't particularly hard but still spending a couple minutes trying to catch my breath in between. And cardio was a huge pain in the ass while being a smoker. At some point my lungs became the limiting factor in progression (especially being at 6k feet).
And that gasping, shallow panting breathing that you have when trying to exercise as a smoker... I kept thinking, this is very likely how I could spend the last few years of my life. Unable to catch my breath for years while slowly suffocating to death. Emphysema is a horrific way to die. And technically it could start any day. Fuck no. No thank you."
"Something I did was the day I thought, ""I need to stop smoking cigarettes,"" I told myself ""alright, I'm done. I'm free. See that was easy now wasn't it?"" 
I stopped because I decided I needed them too much in my life, and I didn't want to become dependent on them. "
"Setting a date in the nearish future, smoking my nuts off till the end (so much so that I was dying to give up by then). Then having some nicotine chewing gum and reducing the dosage over days, then weeks. Giving them up too, but keeping a pack (of chewing gum) in case of jitters. Gave up 15 years ago like that. "

I would agree with caution. Chantix has some pretty strong side-effects. I tried it a long time ago and I'll never forget the kind of dreams I had while taking it. It's how my mom quit though!
"The first time I quit cold turkey I made a big deal of it like I think a lot of people do.  At first it was great, having a lot of congrats and well done! thrown my way but after a few months those go away and I had no motivation left.  I was so concentrated on the number of days since my last cig and I think that hurt me.
The second time I straight up just didn't feel like having a cig one day.  I decided that was my time to quit.  I stopped paying so much attention to the date I quit and just took it one craving at a time.  I let myself have a cig at the bar if I was drunk etc. and didn't punish myself if I slipped up.  After a few months those random cigs started tasting like shit and made me feel terrible.
My bf then followed suit and we decided to start running.  The way your lungs feel after a run when you've smoked for 10 years.....that's what finally did it.  I didn't have high bp or cough a lot or any of the physical things people point to to get you to quit.  We rolled our own (another factor that I think helped us quit - not as many of the synthetic chemicals to intentionally hook you) so the money argument wasn't really there either.  But holy shit.....run a mile and see all the gunk come out of my lungs....that was a game changer.  
Fast forward 2.5 years we have run multiple half marathons, he's ran a full.  We're training for a half in April and a full later this year and we almost never have cravings.  It was also a motivator to eat better and pay attention to other health related issues.  It was a good chain reaction.
My advice to you: find something else to do with your hands that can be done in short increments (like the 5-7 mins you would spend smoking).  I had a friend that took up knitting and would knit for a few minutes any time she had a craving.  Most of all - stop punishing yourself for having cravings!!  Cigarettes literally change your brain chemistry.  You do not have low will power and you are not weak - your brain is literally producing less acetylcholine because of nicotine.  Good luck!"
"My friend quit after finding out the girl he was pursuing wouldn't date him because he smoked.
So, he quit cold turkey and tried again.
They've been married for eight years and have two kids.  He hasn't smoked since."
I used patches. Been smoke and dip free for 7 months now. 
"How were they? Before deciding the cold turkey route, I thought of using them but decided that I wanted to quit the consumption of nicotine all together. Was it hard when you went patch free? (assuming you have)"
"Wanting too, really, but I quit successfully twice (first time for 5 years).   The final time I quit using the patches.  I tapered off on the patches biggest to smallest, and cut the smallest patch in half, then quarters to really draw it out.
 First quit I got the flu and was deliriously sick for three days, and just couldn't smoke.  So I didn't start back up again when I was well enough too a week later.
Honestly though, if you can't quit, at least move to e-cigs."
Why would you want to quit? Smoking is awesome! Don't be such a loser.
"Had an xray that showed a spot on my lung, hacked up blood after I quit which helped me to stay a non-smoker. Ended up being nothing, but still haven't smoked cigarettes since. "
"One day, I just had it and I was done. But I couldn't stop obsessing about it. After about 3 days, I was freaking out so bad that I got some nicotine gym. It eased my cravings a bit. I eventually weaned off that after 60 days and switched to regular gum. That was about 9 and a half years ago. Also, at the time, I was watching my mother end her 2 year struggle with lung cancer. She told me, ""I am so happy that you quit. I couldn't!"" She died when I had about 7 months off cigarettes. So... there's that. 
I still think about having one every now and then. But then I think ""Fuck that."" and the feeling goes away."
"The most effective way to quit smoking is to ACTUALLY WANT to quit smoking.
I smoked a pack a day for 20 years... Then I decided FOR REAL that I didnt want to smoke anymore.
So I stopped smoking.
The end.
Thats it.
I said I really didnt want to smoke anymore. And I was honest with myself about it. 
Then I stopped smoking.
"
"Almost like you have to get mad at it, yeah? Saying, ""I'll finish this pack and not buy anymore"" doesn't work. You gotta say ""Fuck you cigarettes!"" and throw half a pack out the window.
Worked for me.. :)"
"I smoked for 40 years. When I finally decided to quit, (I got a new job in a healthcare setting), I used a hypnosis tape every day, and I used the patch. I think that teaming up those 2 methods was what made me successful.  If I skipped either one, I got cranky and demotivated.
I've been smoke free now for 2+ years, and I couldn't be happier and RICHER!!!!  Every year I get to spend about $2000 at Amazon instead of Marlboro.  That's motivation bitch!
Keep Quitting!  It took me many attempts to be successful.
OH also VERY important!!  I promised myself that I can re-start smoking when I'm 70 years old. Strangely enough knowing that I can have a cigarette in the future, that it's not forever, is very comforting."
"Not me, but my mom smoked for +/- 20 years. Got a heart attack, never smoked again after that."
"I was a freshman in college and had smoked intermittently throughout high school.  I started smoking more frequently when I moved to a big city and my girlfriend of 2 years came to visit and found the pack in my sock drawer.
The decision was made very quickly.  She turned off the tap until I quit and I went cold turkey.  So lots of coffee and bitching at my roommates for no reason."
"It may sound crazy, but getting hypnotized helped my grandparents stop. They both smoked over a pack a day for about 30 years and tried every method to stop. Decided to get hypnotized and haven't had a cigarette since."
I quit 8 times until it stuck. You've gotta condition yourself to genuinely hate smoking. 
"Started Muay Thai, I could feel all the shit gurgling around in my lungs when I was gasping for breath. I stopped smoking for a couple of weeks, noticed that Muay Thai was getting ever so slightly easier and my lungs were ever so slightly less gurgly. The improvements meant that I didn't want to go back no matter what so I stopped being a wimp about things that would normally have made me start smoking again - eg anxiety before job interviews and going out drinking - and just stayed quit. 
Basically I replaced destroying my health with becoming awesome and never looked back."
"I woke up from a bad night last Halloween feeling like shit, decided that day was the day and didn't pick up another one. I used an electronic cigarette to curb those extra strong cravings for the first couple weeks. It's only been 3 months, but I really have no desire for one at all anymore. Most of my friends smoke as well as my coworkers, and I don't want to be anywhere near them anymore because they smell awful to me now. Really helps deter me from wanting another. "
Also go to the sauna so you can sweat out all the leftover nicotine in your body. This'll make quitting easier. 
"I myself smoked for about 16 years.  When my wife became pregnant with our first child, I decided it was time to quit as well.  Coincidentally, I also had to travel to Toronto for work for 3 1/2 weeks.  So, I bought a 4 weeks supply of ""the patch"", which was a generic version sold via one of your typical Sam's Club/Costco or whatever and headed off.
In Canada, my brand of cigarettes (starts with an M) was hard to come by, and about twice what you would pay in the US.  Also, the local tobacco tasted horrible compared to US tobacco, which I had experienced from previous visits.  This all helped to discourage me from jumping from the patch while there back into a smoking routine.
That routine lis the key part to getting past the first few weeks.  Break all of your normal habits and do something different.  For me, it was locking myself in the hotel room when I wasn't working or going out for meals.  I spent a lot of time playing Wii games, which kept my hands busy and sustained the physical activity I was used to getting from walking somewhere every 30 minutes for a smoke.  At the end of the day to de-stress, I drank a LOT of awesome Canadian beer.  I guess you could say that the beer was my reward to myself for making it through another day tobacco free.  
When I returned home, it was rough at first as my usual routines would come into play and the habits began to return.  However, since I had made it through the past 4 weeks without a single cigarette, the act of buying and smoking one seemed strange to me.  I just had to get past the waves of tension nicotine withdrawal cause as I stopped using the patch all together.  By then though, my first daughter was born, so I had something new to take my mind off of the cravings, and ended up giving her all of my fee time and attention.
By the way, and I hope this doesn't discourage you, but for me the physical cravings did not go away for about 2 years after I started the patch.  Also, after the first couple of weeks, you will begin to feel like your getting a cold or bad allergies.  I later learned that this is due to all of the new healthy lung tissue which doesn't have that thin layer of tar acting as a protective seal.  It may take a while of getting frequent colds and congestion until your immune system readapts.
Good luck!"
Never starting.
"I quit cold turkey, several times. The last one worked (two years now) because I read about replacing smoking with another habit or ritual. I chose tea, on a schedule, so I had something concrete to look forward to, rather than ""clamp down on the craving every second of the day, and at some nebulous point in the future, it'll be gone entirely."" Instead, ""Oh, boy, tea!"" You could probably get a lab rat to quit smoking the same way.
Also, when I slipped up, which I did a lot at first, I didn't immediately consider the whole endeavour a failure; I just tried harder not to smoke the next time. Not being terrified of failure took a lot of the pressure and stress out of it."
/r/electronic_cigarette
ITT: bunch of quitters.
"I think it was a combination of things. 
My son asked me too when he was young and got teary eed and told me he didn't want me to die. That probably pushed me well into the fight.
Also, I read somewhere once that after three days you arent addicted and it is all in our head. I dont think it is true, but I just kept riding out the three days and after that I kept telling myself it wasn't real and I dodn't need it. 
After my first week, my wife quit also, so from there on out we did it together and that really kept me together.
Also, I couldn't afford a pack a day at ten bucks a pack. It just didn't make sense to spend that much."
"Throw away the tabacco, and don't buy new."
"I think what finally broke me was the fact that I was *going* broke paying 6-7 bucks for a pack of cigarettes.  If I had to tell you what factors actually led to my success, after 3 or 4 failed attempts at quitting, it would be the nicotine gum, then regular gum, then sunflower seeds.  And lots and lots of self control and self discipline.  Good luck, it's not easy!!"
"I picked a date that meant I wouldn't be around smokers for a good week or so. It was also christmas so no shops were open to sell me tobacco. I cold turkey'd it christmas morning. Didn't really tell anyone I was quitting apart from my mother. Binge ate christmas food, especially chocolates. 36 days and counting."
"Ecigs for a few months. I'd still be vaping, but I gave up trying to get the right taste and throat hit, and by that time the regular-cig fixation wore off."
"I smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and just walked away.
I think what really worked for me was that I was making a lot of changes at the same time. I moved half way across the country alone to a place I didn't know anyone. I smoked about 4 packs on the drive out and decided when I got there that I didn't want to smoke in the new place. 
Not exactly an easy way to quit for most people. The only time I ever wanted a smoke was after eating mexican food, but that faded after a year or so. haven't even thought about lighting up in the 10 years since I quit.
If you need to light up for a break, use it as a timer. Step outside, light the cigarette and jog around the parking lot instead of smoking it. Technically, you're following the rules.
If you really want to quit, you'll find a way. If I can do it, anyone can."
"I used candy cigarettes as real cigarettes, pretending to inhale and all. It worked like a charm."
"I looked myself in the mirror all the time and said ""iranianbastard you're no longer a smoker, so you don't need a smoke"" had a few slip ups but I kept counting how many days I was smoke free and I reset, when I reached the 60 day mark I knew there was no turning back. "
"Wow though I was in r/stopsmoking until I saw the number of replies.  Cold turkey.  No ecigs. Step outside for a break but walk around the building instead of lighting up. Ecigs keep you relying on a bad habit, instead, replace it with a healthy activity :)"
"Not me, but my stepdad has been clean for 15 years because of this. He cut a straw in the length of a cigarette and constantly held, and put it in his mouth as if it were a cigarette. He would chew on it all the time too. He said this tricked his body into thinking it was getting his cigarette fix, while also getting him off nicotine. I'm sure that doesn't work for everyone. But it did for him. "
The picture of the drapes in the bath on here made me quit. Cold turkey. It's been over a year.
Easy. I was in between jobs and couldn't afford to buy cigarettes anymore. 
"I have since started again(after 2 years) but I still believe this is relevant. Part of what is hard about quitting is the fear of it being worth nothing, that you'll just start again. When I quit for 2 years.  It was a week before a devastating breakup and a week and a half before a suicide of a very good friend.  
Rather than allow stress to bring you in, remind yourself this is still something you can overcome, and moreso that life can not make you start again regardless of what it throws at you. Essentially I quit during a very very stressful and devastating month but stuck to it.  I felt prepared for anything. 
For those wondering, I started again for no real reason.  I would smoke occasionally while drinking. Which worked fine for a year but caught up with me and I started drinking and decided I'd rather just smoke again, quit later, rather than lie myself into alcoholism on top of smoking. 
Moving this weekend and I will be considering my new property a non-smoking property so bracing myself for fist pounding torture again. "
"take a puff of your cig, put a white napkin over your mouth, exhale, inspect napkin."
I smoked since the age of 15 and was a pack a day by 16 for about 8 years. To me the only way I know people who have been successful and how I did it was cold turkey. You have to have the self will and motivation to force yourself to stop. Don't make excuses don't say well just one every now and then won't hurt because if you do you aren't going to quit. Its a matter of self will. Once you stop for a couple days you will get more confident. After a few weeks you will start to feel better and have more energy and breathe better. Then your at a month your first huge mile mark. Don't look at it as a time table though. Take it day by day and moment by moment. Resisting when you want one the most is the best way to build up your will and the confidence to quit. Believe in your self. Your brain is stronger than any chemical and you have the will and strength to quit. 
Cold turkey. Just quit. Tell yourself you don't smoke anymore. Don't count days. Don't replace one addiction with another. You're done. Non smokers don't do things like that and once you tell yourself you're a non smoker you'll do the same. 
"My dad quit smoking by just going cold turkey. I'm not sure how, but he just said ""I'm quitting, it's bad for you and I'm getting older"" and just... stopped. Didn't have any method of doing it, he just did."
"I managed to quit 2.5 packs-a-day of nonfilter Camels without suffering.
Every smoker knows the feeling of the 'nicotine nag', the mechanism that tells us to light up, to make sure we have cigarettes before we leave the house, make sure there are matches or a lighter, make sure the lighter has enough fuel, and when to take the next drag.
Every smoker also knows that slightly sick feeling you get when you light up too soon, and have to put out that cigarette. The sick feeling fades, and for minutes more the nicotine nag stays silent, but we'll hear from it soon enough.
That slightly-sick feeling holds the trick to breaking the habit.
You will need several weeks' worth of full-strength (21 mg) nicotine patches, plus scissors and a pencil.
Put on enough full-strength nicotine patches, not just to silence the nicotine nag, but to induce that faint feeling of too-much-too-fast, just to get to the edge of it, feeling a tiny bit sick, enough you can tell, but not enough to worry you. At that point you know you're not going to get sicker because you're not adding more patches, and you are not going to hear a peep from the nicotine nag. That slightly-ill feeling is now your very best friend.
Tally the number of patches because that's now your daily schedule. (It took 2.75 patches of 21 mg strength for me my first day.) At bedtime, take off the patches. After your morning shower, put on the scheduled number of patches.
Now that the nicotine nag has been silenced, start laundering all your clothes and bedding, wash down walls, doors, and windows. Clean furniture and carpets. Clean the inside of your car.
It will take a few days for all the stink to be gone from your sinuses.
Next week's schedule is nine-tenths of this week's. And so on and so on, week after week, knocking it down ten percent each week.
Mathematically, you will never finish. Practically, you will realize one day that you haven't patched up the last several mornings, so you had already kicked the habit and didn't notice."
"This is going to be longer, so please note the TL;DR in the bottom. Also, I am not native english speaking, so please excuse any mistakes. Here's my story:
I started smoking when I was around 14 years old. Soon after, I capped out at around a pack a day and went on like that for 12 years. My closest friends were also smoking and most of them still are. During these 12 years I undertook several attempts to quit, but never really managed much longer than 3 consecutive months until I started again. Most of these attempts were based on willpower to fight the urge of smoking a cigarette. Patches, chewing gums etc as my ""weapons"". A fight that I and most people will eventually lose.
Then, three years ago I finally started to see smoking for what it is and I stopped from one day to the next and never had to fight any urge, never went ""cold turkey"", didn't get aggressive or any of the usual side effects of stopping.
Here are the insights that I gained that changed the way I think about smoking today. They helped me in getting away from it and may help you as well:
* First, I realized that an argument used by most smokers (including me) is that smoking helps when you are stressed. It's calming and soothes the mind.. or so I thought. But if that was the case, how do non smokers manage their stress? They should be stressed like hell with no way to calm their nerves. So I asked myself: ""before I started smoking, was I more stressed than I am now?"" The answer was simply ""no"". Then I asked myself: ""After I started smoking, did I get stressed more often?"" and here the answer was ""yes"". So I realized that it was not everyday life stress that I soothed by smoking, but it was the stress induced BY smoking that I had to soothe WITH smoking. A viscious circle that would only end if I stopped smoking.
* Following the above realization I concluded that the cigarette was not a friend in tough times, but rather a little devil that once let loose manifests itself in ones head and keeps telling you that life is stressy as hell and you can only reduce it by feeding on cigarettes. And each time I feed that little devil, it allows me to feel for a short time as I once did as a non-smoker.. for a short time, until it tells me it's time again to pay (or smoke) the toll..
* I realized that there was only one way out. A pretty easy way actually; stop smoking and get rid of that little devil. Quitting smoking would not mean that I'd have to give up the company of a good companion and constantly think about wanting it back, but rather would I finally be able to get rid of that little devil in my head and forget about it forever. I compare it now to a situation of having a relative pass away; we all have relatives that we like and others that we (really) dislike. Now if the one I like dies, I might miss that person for a long time, if not forever. However, if the one that I dislike passes away, I won't waste two thought about him or her, hell, I might even be happy about it.
And that is how I see it today, I am happy that I don't have to run after my cigarettes anymore, that feeling in the evening of having only one left, debating whether to smoke it now or tomorrow morning. Going out late at night to run down to the store and get a pack because I cannot bear the thought of having no cigarettes left. All these things, gone, and I couldn't be happier. Why would I miss that? Why would anyone?
And each day that I don't feed the little devil, it gets weaker and more silent. From time to time it shows itself for a second or two, but fades away quickly again.
And am I more stressed now than when I was still smoking? No, I am as stressed as I was before I ever started. As stressed as any non-smoker is.
TL;DR: 
* Smoking doesn't make you more relaxed than a non-smoker is. It makes you AS relaxed as a non-smoker, but only for a short time.
* The cigarette is not your friend that you have to miss. It's that little devil you once let loose and have been a slave to ever since. Be happy to get rid of it. You don't ""give up"" smoking, you ""stop"" smoking. There's really nothing to give up, you only gain from stopping.
* When you are around smokers, don't envy them (there really is nothing to be envious of), instead pitty them for still being slaves to that little devil (don't tell them though ;)
I really hope this might help some of you to get rid of that burden. I enjoy everyday being without it and don't miss any of it.
Cheers,
Oxidan

"Wanting to quit.
Not kidding, 'tried' to quit twice before, but I didn't actually want to, I enjoyed it, made me more social, and made me feel like I wasn't as stressed, so I went back to smoking before too long. Second time I even tried an e-cig, didn't much care for it just because I couldn't find a single juice/mixture that actually tasted like a real cig (and I fucking love the taste, weird I know).
But, in about 8 hours it will have been 104 days since my last smoke. And only because I didn't want to. I felt like quitting so i quit. Every now and then, especially when dealing with idiots at work (and there are plenty) I think to myself ""man, I wouldn't mind a smoke right now"" but that's all it is. I don't even know if I can call it a craving, more of a 'meh why not' sort of thing.
Some people react differently, I'd say most do, but like I said, I wanted to quit so I did, and some people will hate me for saying this or call me a liar because it definitely isn't true for most people it seems, but it wasn't hard. I haven't had an actual craving (like I used to have when it had been 2 hours since my last smoke), or anything. Went from a little over a pack a day to 0 at the drop of a hat.
My main advice is to find out how to make yourself want to quit. And I don't mean in a ""well it is better for my health so I **should**"" or ""I could save a lot of money so I **should**"" kind of way. I mean you **WANT** to quit. If you don't want to quit you won't, you may go 4-5 or even 10 years without smoking but you'll go back because: ""it wasn't so bad, it helped me a lot with____ . besides I only quit because___ .""
Want to do it, then do it."
"Totally, TOTally agree. I tried many times unsuccessfully (obviously) but I simply loved to smoke. I liked the ceremony of it, the chatting with other smokers, the break taking, opening a new pack, etc. But at some point, it just didn't feel so great anymore and I didn't want to. Just like you, I just stopped and it wasn't hard. Going on 6 months. Not an official non-smoker yet but that book has definitely closed. Oh and the Quit It Pro App was cool the first couple of weeks."
"E-cigarettes are super for helping you wean off. You just have to be disciplined. After the first 2 or 3 days of only vaping, you'll becoming super sensitive to the odor/taste of cigarettes and they'll actually gross you out. I still smoke occasionally, usually when I drink or party, but I gross myself out when I do and I usually can't even finish a whole cigarette in one shot. 
Maybe try to limit yourself to 3 cigarettes a day (morning, lunch, evening) with the e-cig for a few days, then down to 2, then down to 1. Eventually you'l realize that you don't even necessarily *want* to smoke, you just do it out of habit. Once you;ve realized that, you take note that it has become something you do just because you do it, and it's far easier to tell yourself that you *don't* want to do it anymore and you can stop altogether. E-ciigs are alsoe great because they help you avoid the shitty on-edge phase after you quit, and you can slowly reduce the nicotine amount in them until you're just vaping flavour :) 
Also, for the break thing, I think that if you're allowed to go out for a cigarette, your boss will let you go out for 2 or 3 minutes to breathe fresh air and center yourself. Because that's all you're really doing when you take a smoke break anyways, isn't it? Just a few minutes to yourself to escape from the hectic workplace. You can do the same without cigarettes by taking full deep breaths and reconnecting with your inner calm. 
Good luck barbiesarthritis! It's not impossibruh, you can do it! :)"
"Nicorette worked for me. I went from a pack a day to chewing a lot of nicotine gum. The directions tell you certain amounts for only so long, but I just needed something to occupy me. So I'd start a piece and chew it until my jaw hurt (2-3 hours), take a 15 minute break and then start chewing a new piece. After a couple weeks and slowly cutting down, I switched to regular gum, and eventually stopped that. 3 years later, still no cigarettes. If I get a bad craving (rarely, and only when drinking) I'll buy a nice cigar and smoke that instead."
If gave myself a full year to phase myself out. I went cold turkey right off the bat. Then I would only smoke on the weekends and then not at all. The hardest part of not smoking was while I was drinking.......so I switched to weed and everything was fine.
"Cold Turkey. The first couple of weeks were complete hell, but you get through it and it gets easier and easier."
"This isn't encouraging, but here it goes:
I'm not a smoker, but my Dad was for decades. He was finally able to kick the habit when he went through major surgery and was bed ridden for weeks. During that time, his wife, my step-mother, told him that she would leave him if he lived through the surgery and picked up smoking again. Ultimately that motivation coupled with the fact he was confined to a bed was the combination that worked for him. "
"I smoked a pack and a half a day for 15 years.
I successfully quit 5 months ago using nicotine replacement.
I used 4 mg patches and 2 mg gum for the first two weeks.
I used 2 mg gum for the second two weeks.
I've done a shitload of pushups since."
Fear of dying young. I quit 3 years ago.
"Nicotine patches worked for me. Helps to break the habit of smoking cigarettes before you then break the actual nicotine addiction. But it would be totally useless you truly, truly want to stop."
"Get a better e-cig.  Seriously.  I smoked for 14 years, used an e-cig for about 4 getting more and more involved into the culture.  You also need a real kit, none of that gas station garbage.  The only thing worth trying at a gas station would be an Njoy King.  They're expensive and disposable, but probably the closest thing to the real deal.  After going through a variety of kits, I was finally able to cut off regular cigarettes entirely using a Joyetech E-Roll and Halo's HX3 e-juice.  It helped that the e-roll is the same size as a cig and comes with a case that charges the unit without taking it apart.  Bust it out, take a few drags for 5-10 minutes, put it back and it's fully charged for the next ""cig break.""  Once I started using it like a cigarette, during step outside cig breaks and all that, the transition was almost seamless.  One day I didn't want a cigarette.  I still don't.  Almost 8 months now.
*Edit: I still vape.  No intention to quit that at all.  Shoutout to /r/electronic_cigarette"
E-cigs get me my beloved nicotine while letting me not smell like a smoker.  :D
"Quitting is easy. Bear with me. Usually it goes as many users before me said: one day you just stop and don't look back. Every other method (patches, gum, electronic cigar) will fail sooner or later. What they don't tell you is that the real fight starts in the next hours after you quit smoking and it will last your whole life. You'll need to have a lot of self control so you can say no whenever you're sad or mad and you think a cigar will calm you down, whenever you go out with your friends and they smoke around you, whenever you feel bored and you think a cigar will help you pass the time. In the first year at least you will be craving a smoke more than ever, but as the time goes by it will be much easier to just say no. I've quit 3-4 times before finally quitting 8 years ago and there are still times when I think a cigar would be good. But I just remember myself how long has been since I quit smoking, how bad I smelled and how bad it is for my health. And it works. At least for me."
"Being told I had cancer, got the news went outside to think, smoked a cigarette, then thought *what the hell am I doing?*"
Moved to using an electronic cigarette with nicotine juice.. Really easy to quit smoking cigarettes but I am definitely consuming more nicotine now. 
"Nicotine Patches work like a charm. I started with the strongest one and second day on my was home from work I found one cigarette in my car. Naturally I decided that I should smoke it. Big mistake, because patches have lot of nicotine I got light headed and had to stop on the side of the road for about 10-15min. After that I simply didn't want to smoke anymore... I have to admit that after 3 years of not smoking I did started smoking again.  
P.S. My father also quit smoking with the help of patches. At the time he was a smoker for about 35 years. 10 years later he is still smoke free ... "
"I think regardless of what methods you try to use or incorporate into your plan, you have to genuinely want to quit. You can't want to do it for anyone but yourself. Pick a day and stick to it. Probably the hardest part is keeping perspective and remembering just because you may have a slip, trip or fall every once in a while, don't abandon ship because of one misstep. As for me, I took Wellburtin and it worked for me, but may not have similar results for you (^* ^results ^not ^typical ). What I really liked about that approach is Wellbutrin doesn't just help with smoking, but with many things you do compulsively. Bottom line, everyone tells you how hard it is and it is, but really, you are the one that makes the final determination as to how difficult this will be."
"I will say this.  Cold Turkey worked for both me.  I've been quit for one year and three days.  This is my third quit.  This is the quit that is for good.  It's hard for three weeks.  It's as simple as having your moment saying, ""I'm done.""  It's easy to say but hard to do.  It's hard for about three weeks.
I say this.  Embrace the quit.  Embrace the feeling around it.  Know that the pain you're going though now with the withdrawal will lead to something better and just never smoke another one.  Ever.
One year and three days later, I've lost 40 pounds and I'm running my first ever half-marathon on a trail next month.  A trail-half marathon! Started running 6 months ago and average 25 miles per week.
I'm 42 years old and I'm in the best shape of my life.  I sound like a bow-flex commercial."

"I smoked for 18 yrs . I tried e-cigs that did not  work . I was not addicted to the nicotine it was the oral fixation. I was dating a girl at the time who hated smokers and the smell. She would bitch NON STOP . So i would never smoke around her at all. If i drank i would smoke one or two. After a while I didnt need to smoke at all when i was drunk. Now came the hard part quitting flat out. So i bought boxes IceBreaker mints an every time i had an urge sitting in traffic I would pop a mint open the window put my hand outside the window and the urge would go away. 
So the key to me being smoke free now for 2 yrs is get an annoying as fuck girlfriend who wont stop bitching and some mints. 
(the gf is no longer around and I am still a non smoker)"
"I wanted to quit and I tried to quit so many times, by so many means. I would always tell people that I had quit, in the hopes that the fear of the shame of failing would prevent me from failing. That never worked. I just got better at being sneaky. It wasn't until I truly decided that I didn't want people to know I had failed because I actually didn't want to fail, that I found it disgusting myself. Finally, I was ashamed of myself for smoking. Then, it was easy. "
"I quit smoking last year in September as I caught a lung infection and couldn't breath. I was put on a nebulizer and inhaler because my lungs were so bad. Another 24 hours later I would have ended up in hospital. My doc told to take a good look as if I continued smoking I would end up on the nebulizer within 3 years. Thing was I was a 5 a day smoker. Didn't smoke by day if the kids were around I only smoked at night outside the house when they were in bed. That was the turning point for me, haven't smoked since then."
"For me it was ecigs. It turned into somewhat of a hobby for me since I love to tinker with things. I guess it's not really the same as completely quitting, but I haven't had a cigarette in about 9 months."
"I have been going cold turkey for 2 weeks, the first week sucks but once you get through it it gets better and you start to feel A LOT better. The trick is knowing what and when your triggers are and how to manage them. For me driving, being at work or drinking alcohol, coffee or eating amongst others. Also I found that deep slow heavy breathing when you are craving hard really helps, you start to re teach your brain that clean air is better and more relaxing than a nasty cigarette. Good luck!"
Thought a $1.25 was to much to pay for a pack 
"2 years smoke free.. Smoked almost 20 years.. Tried drugs, gums and patches... 
The only thing that honestly worked was my desire to just stop and not do it anymore.. Nothing will work if you don't want to do it.. It was hell for the first month or so but it got easier.. 
Good luck!! You will thank yourself once you separate yourself from the slavery of nicotine. "
"Don't listen to all these people suggesting e cigs.  It really doesn't help.  Everyone I know who tried it always ended up back smoking regulars, my self included.  The reason for this is that you are not solving the problem with e cigs.  You are still smoking, be it with a placebo.  The key is to kill the habit.  It generally takes the body about a month to get used to something new (ie, new diet, exercise, quit smoking).  My suggestion to you is to sit down and really think about why you want to quit.  Have a real heart to heart with your self.  Decide that you want to quit, I mean really want to quit.  You have to want to quit more than you want a cigarette.  Once you are in that frame of mind, you quit.  It wont be easy, but if you have truly resolved your self to quit, then you can do it.  I did it cold turkey after being a pack a day guy for 5 years.  You just have to want to quit more than you want that cigarette."
"Caring about what I do, following my dreams, making the wise moves in my life to position me for happiness, and surrounding myself with people I genuinely like."
"I smoked pretty steadily for just under 10 years. The first time I quit was about 5 years in. I used nicotine patches and managed to quit for about 6 months. I'd have the occasional drunken / social cigarette, but I considered myself to have quit. Eventually those lapses started adding up and I was smoking leftover packs from a night out. 
The second time I quit was about 2 years later. I think it was a new years resolution. I went cold turkey that time. Rinse and repeat the paragraph above, and you know how that turned out.
I finally quit about  2 years (hopefully going on forever) ago. I had an upswing in my depression and decided to get in shape and set the goal of completing a Warrior Dash (one of those obstacle 5ks). To accomplish this I started running and signed up for a fitness bootcamp. In addition to smokers' lungs, I have some mild asthmatic  symptoms as well, and I just couldn't keep up with the running as I was. But I was so enamored of this idea of reshaping my body and my life that I just knew I could quit-- so I did. Cold Turkey. 
In retrospect I think I may have replaced the addiction of smoking with the addiction to improving my distance and speed when running. Like you, work was a *major* trigger for me. At the time I worked overnights, at a job that bored me to death, largely by myself with a fair amount of down time, and the option of smoking inside my workplace. It was a recipe for temptation. But instead of smoking I'd plan to hit the gym after work and thinking about that kept me on the wagon.
In the 2 years since, I unfortunately haven't kept up with the fitness as much as I'd like, but I have met a wonderful woman who's now my partner. She'd never demand that I not smoke, but she loves me and cares about my health. Having someone to share my life with makes me care that much more about my own health, and now I don't think I could ever smoke again. 
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you have to become a marathoner, or find the love of your life to quit smoking. Those aren't reasonable achievements for everyone, and are pretty conditional on your situation in life. But what you definitely *can* do is find *something* in your life that you're passionate about. Something that's so important to you that it gives your life additional value. Think about how illness or incapacitation  because of your habit might prevent you from enjoying this thing to the fullest, or even shorten the amount of time you have left to enjoy it. That's what really helped me quit.
tl;dr: find something so important to you that you're unwilling to endanger it by continuing to smoke."
"Well when my new gf, who I was really into but whom I did not smoke around found out she told me she didn't date smokers.  We are married now so you can guess how that went."
"Getting cancer at 26. The best time to quit is right now, friend."
"Maybe I'm not the best person to give advice considering I started smoking again a year after I quit.... but as others have said, you have to really, truly want it."
"I found that I just had to stop thinking about it to stay quit. Stop thinking ""I'm in the car-time for a smoke"", ""It's breaktime-time for a smoke"" ""Theres a convenience store-time to buy cigarettes"". Once you begin to see these as thoughts, accept them as OK and let them go without acting on them eventually they stop happening. "
not being able to afford them
I switched to an e - cig and never looked back. It tastes better and can be a hobby.
"I used Chantix awesome stuff. After about a week of taking you pretty much forget about your normal cigarette. Like driving, I got all the way to work, got out of my car and felt like I was forgetting something. The only side effect for me was very vivid dreams, before Chantix my dreams were black and white on an old tube tv, while taking Chantix dreams were like watching 1080P on an LED TV just unreal. And a must is eat something when you take it."
"I finally really wanted to. My wife was pregnant, and I didn't want my kids to grow up around smoking like I did. Before that I was always attempting to quit for self improvement, and I always ended up deciding I wanted to have a cigarette now instead of living longer into my 60s. Tying it to the well being of my kid flipped a different switch. Don't go getting someone or yourself pregnant to quit smoking though.
As far as technique? Cold turkey. From a pack a day to nothing. The first week is a bitch, but if you really want it you can do it. Truth is that you're likely to crave a cigarette now and again for the rest of your life, because the chemical addiction is only a portion of it. For me, the memory of lighting up and drawing that first puff of a cigarette into my lungs feels pretty fantastic."
CASH!!! Not sure if anyone said this yet.  Make a bet with someone else who is trying to quit to see who can quit the longest.  Make it a large amount of money you don't want to part with.  
"I was never that much of a smoker but I could smoke 30 in a night out and I increasingly started smoking more and more. While I started only smoking when I drank, I noticed that I was buying packets whenever I was going on a drive, or having a break in college. 
I wanted to quit for ages. I started smoking a lighter brand (Malbro to SilkCut Silver and sometimes menthol) to ween myself of the amount of nicotine I was getting. I did this for a good six months. I thought I'd never get the courage to actually give up entirely until one faithful Halloween, I spent the night in an enclosed room with six other smokes. I woke up the next morning, took a good look at myself and vowed to never smoke again. 
I threw away my cigs and spent three months avoiding anyone I used to smoke with and anywhere I smoked (cafes, pubs etc.) I cleaned out any evidence of smoking in my car and just pretended I never took it up. I knew if I could go three months cold turkey, I would beat the craving. After those three months, I started testing myself. Hanging out with smokers, going to bars and cafes that I used to smoke in. I knew I had beaten the beast after that. That was the 1st of November 2011. I never smoked again. It was the best decision I have ever made and one of the very few things I am 100% proud of. I would recommend it to anyone who smokes. It's disgusting to me now.  "
"Also, apps that track your progress are extremely helpful. "
"I have a reason for quitting that most find peculiar, but seems totally feasible to me. Simply put, I want to live forever. I feel that with all the advances in the past 100 years, both with science and technology, that it is perfectly reasonable to believe that ""they"" will either cure death, or at the very least slow or reverse the aging process. And it would suck to die of lung diseases before that happens. 
It also helps to have a super awesome non-smoking SO that is way more important than smoking. 
TL:DR - cold turkey, live forever. You gotta want it. "
"I consciously decided to simply quit inhaling and treat it like a cigar and I had no real cravings while doing this. I didn't even plan to stop smoking, I just wanted to be healthier about it but I found myself needing to go smoke less and eventually noticed it had been days since my last smoke so I just didn't do it anymore."
"Pack a day for like 15 years. I used nicotine gum. 6 years later, i'm smoke free but i'm still chewing the gum. At the end of the day,  It's healthier and cheaper than smoking.... I may have to smoke to get off the gum.  "
A single psilocybin trip rid me of my pack-a-day habit that I held for years before
"Smoked from the time I was about 12 until I was 22. Just turned 28 haven't had a smoke since. Quit while I lived in a house full of people drinking and smoking all the time. It's a cliche but you have to want to quit. You can't be fantasizing about smokes all the time. A buddy of mine said ""you have to be hypocritical, you have to hate smoking even though you loved it yesterday"". I convinced myself I hated the smell. Now I couldn't have a smoke if you paid me. "
"For me it was the realization that smoking itself makes you feel like shit, and you only THINK you get a buzz/pleasant feelings. Basically, the moment from the initial craving, up until you light one up and take that first drag is all satisfying, but it's all downhill after that. After you're done with the cigarette, your body feels way worse. The only satisfaction is the psychological one, that you had a craving and satisfied it.
"
"This will probably get buried but...
On New Years Eve, 2010, I smoked a pack of menthols and a pack of cloves. It made me so sick that I was tasting the cloves well into the next week and ever since then I haven't been able to smoke cigs or even be around them. 
I did pick up a pretty heavy marijuana smoking ""addiction"" thought."
Determination worked for me
"Wanting to quit was a huge part of my equation. Much like an engine won't run without gas, you won't quit without the genuine desire to do so. I'd estimate having tried to quit no less than a dozen times...ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months but always faltering and going back to smoking.
That being said, find support through a friend/acquaintance who also wishes to quit. Make a $100 no bullshit bet. Thirty days, no smoking. The first one to smoke loses and pays up. And if you have any honor whatsoever, know that you'll pay up if you lose.
At the end of my 30 days, I was well on my way to having quit. I even found out much later on that I actually won the bet, but was so thrilled with having quit smoking that I didn't even care enough to collect. 
Good luck!
It's been 13 years as of today, still smoke free and happy as hell to be rid of that shit."
"Cold turkey. I finally had enough with the morning hack, the smell and the taste. I finished my last pack almost resentfully and never looked back. A few times I wanted to get a pack I didn't, and it's been over a year since I had a smokey treat. I decided it was enough."
"Weed, smoke weed evry time you want a cig. You only need to smoke a little bowl to get high rather than a whole cig. First day i did this i did not smoke any cigs. Never even had the urge either. After a month it was like magic i had not smoked any cigs and did not feel much of the side effects. Then i just slowly cut down on smoking weed which is alot easier to quit. And in two months i stopped smoking completely with minimal stress.
Used to be a chain smoker for 3 years pack a day kind of seal."
"I liked to think that I only smoked socially and wasn't addicted but when I tried quitting I realized I was. I was able to quit while working a boring job in retail that gave me plenty of time to smoke or do something else. What worked for me was lack of funds. For a week or so, I had no money to do anything including buy cigars or cigarettes. After a while I lost track of the last time I had one. "

"Excellent question.  It was definitely the point that I made up my mind for good and just stopped.  It took about 5 days or so of torture, but it was worth it."

"Getting pregnant, the second I found out (which was very early in the pregnancy) I quit. I couldnt imagine smoking while pregnant, its been almost 7 years and even though it gets easier I still eant to pop out back for a smoke...."
"i only social smoke, and now i don't know anybody who smokes, makes it easier. And yeah its forbidden to smoke while you work at my workplace. But couple of years ago i worked at a resturant and i loved getting those extra breakes because i smoked. "
"I just hit my 8 months quitaversary on the 22nd - and I did it cold turkey.  Ever since then I've made it a goal to take at least a few minutes to tell potential quitters how I approached the problem and then dealt with it (and quite successfully so far).
Part of it had to do with the events going on in my life, part of it had to do with *following through with my own quit rules*.
Background: I was not a long-term smoker.  I'm sure this makes some difference but that difference was not enough to keep me quit the first, the second, third, fourth, on and on and on x100000 times I attempted to quit before May last year.  It is still the most difficult thing I have ever accomplished in my life.
How'd I do it?
--Well, I actually wanted to quit deep down.  Basically, each failed attempt at quitting (gum, lozenges, e-cig, etc) was another stepping stone for me to use towards that desire to quit
--Then I found this site: http://whyquit.com.  This guy is great.  Not because he's unintentionally hilarious (my god, those teeth...), but because he lays it down cold-fucking-blooded, factually, and rather abrasively that You, Sir or Madam, are a fucking *addict* - you're right there with the rest of them and, in a lot of cases, more strongly addicted.  So the road is going to be rough and rocky.  And this is where I'd usually stop before making my new attempt.  Except this time...
--I decided to swap the idea of quitting *cigarettes* with the more accurate goal of quitting my ADDICTION to cigarettes.  Because by god it certainly wasn't the flavor or image appeal that got me hooked to cigarettes.  Nicotine got me.
--I intensely studied up on timelines for quitters.  Know where you are in the process and what *may* be in store for you at 5 days quit, 2 weeks, etc etc.
--Write all of this shit down!  Tape it somewhere where you can see it every day when you wake up.  It doesn't matter if you actually look at it daily... It's the act of displaying it that's important.
--Write down a list of all of the most attractive, wonderful, and freeing qualities of someone who is a nonsmoker.  Yea, that could be you.  Sexy, isn't it?  Look, remember, think about this list when you get a craving.  You're a nonsmoker?  I'm no statistician but I'd say your chances of gettin booty are unbelievably higher than those of a smoker.
--Come up with *small* things that you can do to keep your hands busy when you get a craving.  The more pleasure you get from doing it (publicly acceptable things, mind you), the better the thing is.  Me? I started playing Candy Crush, chewing toothpicks when I found them, and *flipping the pages of a book*.  Yea.  Some of you know what I'm talking about; that small wave of oooooohhhh yeeeeaaaa when you thumb a thick book's pages real quick... Whatever works.
--The rewards system.  You'll want to do this.  It just feels great when you start noticing all the money you're saving.  Now, for me it wasn't immediate because I ended up supplementing the extra cash with extra things that I was already buying, like gas, food, and necessities, but you can use it whichever way you want.  When I hit my one year anniversary I'm buying myself a new guitar.  But not only is that a great goal to have, it's a great feeling knowing that *I have literally been able to pay off several large, outstanding bills now that I've quit smoking*.  THAT, fellow reddebtors, is an amaaaaazing feeling.
Sorry for the lengthy reply but maybe you or someone else will read it and gain a piece of info that helps in the process.  That's worth the amount of time it took to type this on my phone *any* day.
There is one final piece of advice that I need to share.  It's from that website I posted and it is still probably the most crucial piece of advice in the bag when it comes to me *staying* quit.  This hurt a little bit the first time but I feel like it's true:
You will *always* be a nicotine addict.  There's no off switch.  There's only ""I have quit.""  What that means for you, what it still means to me, is that you are and always will be on a knife's edge.  Sometimes, 10 years later, you'll still get a random craving.  And just like you would never give ""Just a taste"" of wine to a recovering alcoholic, so must you treat yourself from now on.  That ""just a drag"" at your best friend's bachelor party?  The quick puff of your friend's cig outside of Denny's after a meal?  Those small hits of nicotine will reset your entire quitting process to day one.  But you can do it.  I did it in the midst of stressing out over not knowing if a baby was actually mine, going through the court process for a charge from years ago I was still dealing with, AND receiving a promotion to management where I work.  I needed all of the cigarettes!  But I got through it and it got better.
Everything smelled a lot better too :)
Good luck!"
"My friend is an amateur boxer so he runs a lot for his training. I thought it looked fun and decided to join him and since then I've ran several 5k's and generally run a few times a week, I smoked for 8 years and since that day I went running with my friend, I decided I never wanted to smoke again. February 5th will make two years since I've quit and I couldn't be happier."
"Just did it. Sorry, I don't have better advice. It's the only thing that worked for me. I've been off it for four years now :)"
"I smoked for 7 years from 1996 to 2003.
I tried quitting 3 or 4 times prior but always gave back in when I'd drink.
I finally just got so disgusted with myself every single time I smoked that I reached a tipping point where I couldn't stomach the thought of it but knew I'd just give in again when I drank. 
I was discussing my desires to quit smoking with a buddy of mine at work and after listening for a bit he said something that is so ""duh"" obvious but for some reason really sank in. He said something along the lines of ""no one controls what you do but you, if you want to quit, no one is going to make you, you have to decide for yourself and stick to it""
Silly right? But for whatever reason what he said combined with the disgust I felt ever time I did smoke finally did the trick.
So, I decided to quit cold turkey both smoking and drinking.
I never again had another smoke after that and didn't have a single drink for a full year. After 1 full year then I eased back into have a beer here and there and found that I didn't care to binge drink on the weekends like I had the years prior and never drank at the same levels since then either. "
"I quit by chewing the heck out of Nicorette and eating Ritz crackers. That caused a different set of problems, but I've been smoke-free since 1997."
"I took a week off and visited my family that I was embarrassed to smoke around. I wanted to play with my niece and nephew without having to worry about it. I grabbed some nicotine lozenges and knuckled through. It was surprisingly easy in a stress-free environment. I stopped the lozenges as soon as I got back and kept track of my cravings with an app. Hardly think about it anymore!
You have to want to quit for yourself. Not because someone else wants you to. "
"When my mom quit smoking, she put a bunch of cigarette buts in a bottle with water and kept it under the sink. Every time she wanted to smoke, she'd open the bottle and smelled it. It was so putrid, it would make her not want a cigarette anymore. "
"One day I realized that I smoked a ton in my car because I was bored.  My biggest hurdle was to get used to not smoking in my car so that I would be used to being bored without lighting up.  After that, it was fairly easy to stop although I did swear off drinking for a few months (because I would also smoke a lot more when I was drinking).  Hope this helps."
"A couple things:
Ecigs totally work, the only catch being you need a good quality ecig.
Part of smoking is you're conditioned to smoke at certain times and in certain situations. Some people smoke everytime they drive, or after sex, or after dinner, or when the wake up. When you quit these times are when you're going to get the worst cravings. If you can break the cycle and not indulge at these times then when you quit you wont get intense cravings at these times and it'll ultimately make your life a lot easier.
If you have a significant other, have them help you. They don't need to yell at you when you slip up (that'll just make things difficult between you two) but rather have them give you encouragement, if you can't quit for yourself quit for them. I can talk myself into indulging, but when my gf tells me it breaks her heart to see me smoke, it makes me want to quit.
also, just remember, you *can* do it. It feels impossible sometimes, but remember, people before you have done it, and you can do it too."
"First post, hoping I can help someone.
I loved smoking. Loved it. Up until my late 20's, I had no desire whatsoever to stop, and doubted I would be able to when the time came anyway. I was weak in that I could not go cold turkey - I simply wasn't strong enough. Everything I did - every gathering, every trip, every errand, my budget - was planned with smoking at the forefront of my mind. I started and ended my days smoking in bed.
What actually got me to make a serious attempt at quitting was seeing a really disturbing image. I was waiting to get my hair cut, picked up a Time magazine, and inside saw a picture of a 35-year-old with advanced lung cancer. He had wasted away, I'm guessing to less than 100 pounds. His skin was like grayish beige paper stretched over bones, mouth hanging open, sunken cheeks and eye sockets, looking very much like an ancient Egyptian mummy. However, what really got to me was his spouse - sitting on a chair next to the bed and staring with an expression of profound sadness. I was 30 at the time, and thinking ""this could be ME in a couple years. I thought I had more time!""
There are several parts to a cigarette addiction - the nicotine and the physical fingers/mouth/smoke thing. I knew I couldn't beat all of it at once, so I used nicorette. The thing is, the gum doesn't work very well if you follow the instructions and park it on the side of your mouth. Most of the nasty stuff just ends up running down your throat, making you gag. I failed my first attempt, then discovered that the key is to park it like dip - alternating between the upper and lower lip.
I also drank an enormous amount of beer for the first few weeks, which seems counterintuitive because the two are always so connected, but it kept me busy. I also continued to use the gum for far longer than recommended, about 10 months, gradually reducing the amount until I would keep the same piece in my lip all day long. I could still taste the bitterness at the end of the day, which after 16 hours was probably an almost immeasurably small amount of nicotine, but I had beaten the fingers/smoke habit so long ago that when I finally quit the gum it was a non-event. I believe that this extremely gradual reduction in addictive behavior is the reason I was so successful. To this day I can hang out with smokers without being bothered by the smell, and drink without cravings.
Source: I smoked 1-2+ packs/day for 14 years. My last drag was on July 31, 1999."
"I quit because I was always sick with bronchitis & had asthma attacks daily.  I used Nicorette gum & quit successfully.  I had tried Nicorette when it first came out (available by prescription) & the taste was awful, but they have made great improvements to the flavor - it's like regular gum.  Good luck to anyone trying to quit."
"I quit cold for about a year and then found myself surrounded by some smokers at a party.  Had one and was buying again the next day.  Did a little research and bought some e-cigarette stuff.  Found myself with the same group that got me started again about a 10 months later.  Could not stand to be near real cigarette smoke.  I get headaches around them now.
As for the e-cig, I'm using it less and less.  Will probably run through the juice I have left and give it away."
"a few things. I had some nicotine gum I'd rarely uses, but I was unemployed and broke. Granted I could of scrounged up enough money for a pack of smokes. Honestly the other thing that helped me is I just binged on Civilization IV for 2 or 3 days straight. Honestly when you're so fixated on a game it sometimes won't crave nicotine. "

"WANTING to stop smoking. If you deep down don't want to stop, you never will. "
"[Not](http://lifehacker.com/5724711/how-to-break-bad-habits) an ex-smoker, but an 'addicted' procrastinator. Your brain is lazy and wants to standardize behavior patterns. Fat people for example, the second they sit in the chair they always eat chips in, get triggered to want to eat chips. Their brain unleashes it's growing force upon that person, for which after every time they give in, it get's harder and harder to not eat chips. Instead of giving in to the force with cigarettes, give it something else: like an apple or something that you continiously and often use to condition the brain to think that whenever you get that craving it gets that thing with which it will  eventually associate with. 
Also, you really need to 'want' to change. Knowing that you *should* change and say that you want to change isn't enough. You really, deep down, need to want to change. "
"First let me say this.  I think you really have to want to quit for any program to work.  That being said, I used Chantix and followed their program.  After three days I had smoked my last cigarette, that was 3 1/2 years ago.  Good luck!"
"My son was born, and a year later I realized I was spending money that I should be spending on him for my own disgusting habit. It hurt me when I wanted to buy him a something that costed $100 and my wife told me that after the bills were paid, there wouldn't be enough left over. Insert gut punch here. Cold Turkey the next day. I realized that man cannot serve two masters, so I chose my son's happiness over my own, and although I was depressed for the first couple of months, it gets a little easier every day. Plus no more running outside for a quick smoke and leaving the TV as a 5 minute babysitter. Not a day goes by that I dont think about smoking, but I have been healthier, sleeping better, and dont have stomach problems that used to plague me from smoking."
"This might sound stupid but when I tried to quit smoking years ago, a doctor told me the best way is ""cold turkey"". I didn't know the definition of it and thought the actual cold turkey at my supermarket could help so I went on a strict cold turkey diet for the next two week...."
"I noticed that when i felt sick I would smoke less. I waited until I had a major life change approaching, getting married, and timed my quitting to the day after my bachelor party. I drank heavy and smoked like a pack and a half in 4 hours.
The next day I was soooooooo sick and I have never even felt the urge to smoke since. It was just a little mental trick but it worked like a charm and my brain will always associate that awful feeling with smoking.
Edit: strangely though drinking got off scott free."
"First it was understanding that relapse is a part of recovery; the more times you try to quit the more likely the next time will be the last.
Then I went cold turkey several times. I ignored people who joked that this was the last time until the next time. Finally though I quit and it stuck. I haven't smoked in around three years.
You quit smoking everyday for the rest of your life. Someone will light up and you'll smell it and you will get that familiar feeling between your fingers and in your head; it never goes all the way away."
"Just cut back to start with, that way you don't obsess over wanting a smoke, and don't keep telling yourself and others ""I quit"". It's how I did it, I would maybe smoke one every so often. Now I can't even stand the smell of them."
"Lots of people say you have to really want to quit smoking. I'm not really sure that's true.  I really wanted to quit hundreds of times of the course of my 20+ years smoking habit but never did. I have tried to quit a dozen times as well. 
Most times with I had tried to quit, I had a great reason and/or a strong motivators to quit. The last time I quit (I haven't had a smoke in 5+ years now, I want particularly motivated nor did I actually believe I would succeed. The difference this time was that I didn't pick up a cigarette. (That sounds stupid and totally obvious but it's true)
To get me through the first couple weeks, I sat in front of my computer, joined a quit smoking forum, and I used them as a support group.  
It worked for me"
"Cold Turkey - but you have to have the right motivator. See below
NPR just had an EXCELLENT story about this subject. It involved Present Bias and the need to find something that you can compete with the now desire, not the future promise. And this actually worked for me.
**EDIT - Found it** - [You Vs. You](http://www.radiolab.org/story/117291-you-v-you/)
In my case, I had a girl that I was madly in love with and she was tired of the smoke. One day she said could not deal with it anymore and did not want to deal with cancer like she did with her father. She was on the verge of leaving.
So the ""now"" threat, became stronger than the ""now"" desire. It worked much better than promising myself something in the future, which I had been doing for years. It took a strong motivator in the now to get me to quit. the trick is, finding a treat that is persistent with your smoking habit.
In the case of the NPR story, a lady trying to quit had been trying to do so for some time. Did all the thing some people tell you to do about making promises to yourself, incremental slowdown. None of it worked for her. So, she made an agreement with her friend, that if she ever smoked again, he friend had authorization to donate $5,000 to the KKK. She HATED the KKK. So the now threat became bigger than the now desire. She has not smoked in 10 years... cold turkey.
Everyone is different, but it is a solid strategy with proven results. Seems like some of your top comments have similar scenarios... current persistent detractors that were greater than the need to smoke."
"I have quit a couple times but never 100% usually for a week or two.  The few things that have made me quit, women (if I am dying for her and she wants me to quit I will), Money (I cut back from 4-5 packs a week to 1-2 when I moved to Chicago), and e-cigarettes.  Now with e cigs I usually hit up a cigarette a day some times I get cravings and go through a couple in a day.  Overall, smoking was a college addiction for me.  Now that I am out I am taking 4 more years to move out of the festi, potsmoking, binge drinking, lung destroying habits."
Exercise and flavored toothpicks. 
"I said to myself, ""Stop being a little bitch."" So I did, and I quit.

"29 years smoking a pack a day, here.
I had tried everything but Chantix and hypnosis.
I had quit cold turkey for about 3 weeks. These were my symptoms for 5-6 days:
- Cold sweat
- Blurred vision
- Flu-like muscle pain all over my body
- Mood swings with outbursts of rage
Since Chantix looks really too scary I went for hypnosis. Because it was the last thing on my list and I could tell my family I had tried everything. Hypnosis is for bored to tears menopausal Berkeley women, right?
The session lasted 20 minutes, and the lady told me I was "" a non-smoker now, buh-bye gotta take care of my next patient"".
I remember telling myself when I was driving back home, fuming, I would write her the nastiest Yelp review in the history of yelp. I was mad all evening. I had a very busy next morning and by noon I realized that I had not smoked. Normally I would have had at least 5 cigarettes.
It was 14 months ago. I haven't had a cigarette since."
"Exercise, time and patience."

"Find some old (ideally 70+) people who never quit and observe them *very* carefully. Watch their mannerisms. Really look at the details of their skin, the color of their eyes, how much hair they have, etc. "
"Alan Carr's book ""The Easy Way"". "
"I have not been smoking for 6 month, I started doing cardio wich was VERRY hard because my lungh were bad. I also started taking nicoret pills (not chewing gum). So when I was suposed to smoke (at the end of a job day for exemple) I popped a nicorette. What made me do it instead of lighting up? I was thinking about that horrible sensation that I had while doing cardio, like breathing cream instead of air."
"Go to a hospital, see how miserable someone is with lung cancer, sit down and contemplate how awful it will be for the last time you are on this earth your coughing up blood with a shortness of breath."
You have to want to quit and also staying away from people who smoke. I relapsed a few times because almost all of my friends smoked. But I made it! And so can you!
"Well I see most people here are saying that the gum, patches, lozenges, etc. don't work, but they worked for me.  I bought the patch and used that after I had my morning shower.  They say they last all day, but it would start wearing off around 5pm or so.  Usually I would work out after work (5pm), so I would take my patch off before my workout.  
Then later on in the day when I was craving a smoke, I'd use a nicotine lozenge (or two) to get through the night.  Eventually I didn't need the lozenges anymore, as the patch was good enough to get me through most of the day.  Then eventually didn't need the patch anymore.  
Good luck! "
"I was at two packs a day and had been smoking for ten years at this point. This is how I did it: Patches come in three stages and recommend you wear each stage for 2 weeks. I doubled the time, wearing each stage for four weeks. I also replaced cigarettes with Dum Dum suckers (I sucked about 15 Dum Dums a day). During all of this I exercised daily save for one day a week (Personally, I ran, but do anything that works up a sweat and gets your heart rate going.) I also abstained from drinking for the first month. It wasn't super easy, but if you actually want to quit and have thought about the reasons why you want to, and you have a respectable amount of willpower, this could work for you. 
EDIT: Smoke free for a year now."
"Quitting something is a negative, you need to fill that void with something positive or you're just going to keep looking at that hole in your life until you cave in. I found exercise filled that void best because it really did come down to 'one or the other'. Once I had built up enough endurance to jog a bit the idea of having a cigarette after that jog just didn't seem right.
tl;dr - don't quit, replace."
Chantix worked for me.
"People don't really talk about this much, but try dropping acid."
"Go back to 1968. Everyone smoked. My mother was about 2 years old. My grandfather smoked some 40 a day, not counting cigars. My grandfather lost his dad at 14 to a bad bout of flu (at that time, some 10 years prior to this story, the pneumonia he suffered from wasnt considered smoking related, even though it almost certainly was). He had grown close to one of his uncles, who had sort of stepped in to help out. This uncle, my great, great uncle, died. Lung disease. My grandmother stayed home with my mum, but my grandfather went to the funeral. 
When he came home, he looked at mum playing on the floor, and without saying a word, took the half finished pack from his pocket and threw it out the window. Never touched tobacco since.
Skip forward some 35 years. Mum is now in her late 30s, I am about 12 or so, so its some 8 years ago now. We are planning a big family holiday. All booked up when my grandfather falls ill. Too ill to fly. Flu. Then pneumonia. At the time I just thought he had a cold, but I can see now that everyone was terrified. After all, the same thing had killed his father. Well we leave, after he makes us, and while on holiday, he gets a lot worse. The man isnt educated. But he is smart. He called his friend, got him to check in every day just in case. Both of them witness my grandfather hacking up this black fluid. Buckets and buckets of it. This continues for a week. The fluid thins, lightens and finally stops. My grandfather recovers. His lungs will always be scared, but amazingly, after 35 years cold turkey, he is tar free.
My grandfather is the most amazing man I have ever met. He is 74 this year. He walks a mile into town every day to get the paper and then walks the mile back. Rain, sun, sleet, even hail. He has the energy of someone a quarter of his age and often plays football (soccer) with my brother for over an hour or more. He is currently redecorating our house, he gardens (and I mean he digs up trees) and a couple of years ago I took him to a Willie Nelson concert, where he was on his feet, singing, dancing and yelling for as long as Willie was. He is never happier than when he has a painters brush in his hand, a tin of emulsion balanced on the rung above his feet and country on the radio. He has been married 51 years to my grandmother, 73, who also walks into town to get the shopping every day, stopping off for a cup of tea with each of 5 different people. Despite the town changing a lot in the last 70 years, you only have to take a walk with them to say hi to at least 50 people, all of whom know them by name and sight. Neither worked jobs that paid more than minimum wage, they have no savings to speak of and cant afford many luxuries, but this year, when my girlfriend from the States came to spend christmas, they each forked out close to å£50 on presents for her, because ""If you two stay together or not, shes family, and we love her."" Before this, the last time they met her was for 5 minutes. 
Quitting smoking single handedly saved my grandfathers life. He continues to be an inspiration to me, and his words of wisdom have guided me, despite me enjoying a much better quality of life than he ever had. And if I ever need to smile, I just need to talk to him.
TL:DR Grandfather smoked 40 a day, plus cigars. He quit because he knew it would kill him. The tar stayed in his system for 30+ years, but he is clear of it now, and healthier than most his age. You can do it /u/barbiesarthritis. It will be tough, but I, for one, know you can."

"wikibot, what is Cold Turkey?"
"For me it was the opposite of every advice I heard.
Instead of throwing away your smokes and resisting temptation.  I bought every kind of smokes that I loved.  Expensive ones that I only smoked on rare occasions, pipe tobacco, chew, cigars, and anything else I'd ever tried.  I surrounded myself with these and kept them by me always.  I wanted to make sure I could always have a smoke lit in 5 seconds.
The rationale for me was that if I couldn't say no to smoking, I hadn't quit.
I also fasted for a few days.  Apparently that helps reduce your dependency on nicotine (I don't know if this is true).
Over 1000 days smoke free now!"
"I've been quit now for 6 years. I tried many things to quit, but Chantix helped me finally kick the addiction. I was able to continue smoking for the first week and the physical addiction was totally gone after about two. That being said, if you're considering Chantix, be ready for some really strange dreams and some bad moods while your body goes through withdrawl."
chantix worked for me. used it for a week and i was done. it still sucked but it worked. I then had nightmares for the next three months of either killing people or being killed. but i dont smoke anymore so it was worth it.
"Games, played a hella a lot of games to distract me those first few days. I took a few days off from work since I'd knew I'd be a bitch and did nothing but play league of legends, skyrim, or bf3 anytime I wanted a smoke. Afterwards when ever I really felt the need to smoke I'd usually force myself into a game of league and since I can't smoke in my house I'm kinda stuck not smoking for at least 35-50 minutes.

"I had been smoking regularly for about a month when I looked in a mirror one day and could barely believe my eyes: my skin was a tint of yellow (I'm white as can be), my eyes looked sunken back into their eye sockets, the bags under my eyes had never been so prominent before, and overall I just looked sickly. I cut down to a couple a week and that all disappeared seemingly within days.
On somewhat of a sidenote: is there anyone else who smokes or smoked that just never became addicted? Even during my peak of smoking about 6 cigarettes a day, I only did so because they were relaxing and the people I was hanging out with always had a pack or two between them. I never got any desire to buy a pack for myself, I always bummed them and repaid my friends through food or spare change here and there. To this day I'll smoke a cig if I'm offered one then never think twice about it later. I've never felt the physical craving or withdrawals that so many people profess to, and I've got a horribly addictive personality in general, which is what surprises me the most.
I'd compare it to eating cake: if someone offers me some I'll sure as hell take them up on it, I'll enjoy ever bit of it, briefly fret about my health, maybe think about how good it was later, then proceed to not even consider buying a cake a day. Am I Just an outlier or are there others who are the same way? "
"Pneumonia. Might've been unrelated, but it got me to quit cold turkey. 
It's been a year."
"Longtime lurker, but had to create an account, because I finally have something worthwhile sharing.
I had been a smoker for around 10 years by the time I eventually 'quit'.
And in that time period, I'd have probably tried quitting at least 75 times.
I tried every trick in the book - from the psychotherapy, to nicotine gum etc (not electronic cigarettes, they werent available then).
But every time I failed, I always knew that I would be successful someday.
During one such failure (or maybe the question was forming in recent unsuccessful attempts), I realized that there had to be a pattern for the failure (yes, stress is constantly cited, but that is an excuse). I was looking for an underlying cause.  
Then it hit me - my problem was saying 'Never'.  When I crush a cigarette and threw it away, i was ok for a day,but the thought ate me up inside that i could never smoke again ( as much as i wanted to quit, i enjoyed that shit, it was my friend in times of need, whatever)
Thankfully, I didnt have a medical condition necessitating my quitting, so I had time to play with - I decided to change my approach just a little bit.  
I told myself that I can smoke anytime I wanted to, but I choose not to right now.
The sense of empowerment was unbelievable.
Suddenly, I could keep going for hours without smoking, and keep going even days without smoking.  The pack was always within reach, if I wanted it.
So, see what works for you, and follow it.  Sorry to say, but as long as you are going to rely on 'aid's like electronic cigarettes, it will come back.  
As i tell my friends quitting smoking is a psychological issue, not a physiological one.  The physiological aspect is very easy - you have nicotine patches, gums, electronic cigarettes.  But it's the psychological aspect of it that makes you fall off the wagon.
I had to go through an elaborate mind tricking exercise over a period of 6 months to completely stop buying packets of cigarettes, but it just worked.
I can elaborate further if you need help with how I did it. PM me and i can lay it out.  It's kind of a long winded exercise, and I dont want my response to be longer than it already is.
disclaimer - I havent quit in the true sense.  I still smoke when i get together with old friends. which is probably once or twice in a year, or once in a few years.  I can live with that, compared to half a pack everyday.
TLDR - figure out what your psychological reason is that is making you go back, and deal with it.  But it can be done."
"As a former analog smoker now all-digital for about three months, I am really happy to see all the stories of e-smokers gradually lowering the nicotine content until they just don't want it anymore. That's my plan and I'm glad to know it can work. "
"I quit chewing tobacco almost a year and a half ago. My girlfriend told me she thought it was disgusting and a deal breaker, and I was sick of having to jump in my car or go home just to have a chew because I was self conscious around my friends. I did it cold turkey, and I honestly think it's the best way. Replacement can work for some, but you're going to deal with the headaches and the urges at some point. Might as well be from day one. 
I made myself a calendar and ticked it off each day I didn't pack a lip. Once you get a month out, look back at that and you'll see that you've come too far to ever go back. I have, and it's been a year. Good luck! "
"I quit on the 1st of Jan. and haven't had one since.  I quit cold turkey.  I was up to smoking 2 packs a day after a 25 year habit.  I will tell you what worked for me finally.
Quitting smoking is mainly a matter of mental discipline.  Yes, the physical addiction to nicotine is very real.  However, the withdrawal from the nicotine is nothing compared to the psychological withdrawal.
You must first imagine what it is like to a non-smoker again.  Do you remember not rushing to an exit after departing an airplane?  Or what it is like to just sit and chat after a meal instead of excusing yourself to go  smoke?  Don't you relish the idea of tasting and smelling things again?  You need to really focus on what it was like to be a non-smoker and what it will be like to be a non-smoker again.
Then chose a date and just quit.  Just become a non-smoker!  Get rid of all smoking accessories.  Non-smokers don't need lighters, matches, cigarettes or any other smoking paraphernalia and neither do you.  Every time I thought about smoking after that, I would say to myself ""No thanks, I don't smoke"" as if someone was offering me a cigarette.  For the first couple of weeks I was saying it to myself hundreds of times a day.  It's been 4 weeks now and I maybe think about smoking 3-4 times a day and the cravings aren't bad at all, almost non-existent.  I know I am done smoking forever.
You need to truly want to be and then become a non-smoker."
"I categorized my quit into to fronts.  The physiological addiction and the psychological one.
I used the patch system to take care of the physiological addiction.  I trusted that the patch would take care of the physical withdrawals.  I had faith in the patch to do that work for me so that I could direct my energies in battling the psychological addiction.
To deal with my psychological addiction to smoking I had many tricks to help re-associate my habit.  I put some thought into what my triggers were.  
When smoking there is a lot of hand to mouth movement.  I also didn't want to replace that motion with food so I cut straws to the length of a cigarette and kept that motion going for a while until it faded.
I smoked in my car, so knowing that driving would be a trigger, I lit some incense, stuck it between my fingers, and mimicked the motion of ashing out the window. Not only did it help with that association but it smelled great.
I did my best not to over eat (trigger) and I did not drink alcohol for about 2 months after I quit.  Did I get cravings to smoke?  Yes I did.  I had to trust in the patch and re-associate my desire to smoke with some other activity.  My favorite tea helped in those situations.  Want to smoke?  Have some tea.
I even discovered more triggers as I quit.  End of a quest line in WoW?  Commercial break?  Time to smoke.  That surprised me.  I still every once in a while get the desire to smoke but it comes and then it goes away.  I will probably continue to get those desires for the rest of my life, but I have to remember that they go away.  They dont stick around and the longer I have been quit, the further apart those cravings get. 
So yeah, I went from being a pack a day smoker to successfully quitting.  It's been 5 years.  I managed to not only quit, but actually lost 5 pounds doing it so I have that going for me ;) 
Best of luck to you and your process.  You have my support and if you need to talk I am here to help."
"Tried an Electronic Cigarette, the juice I used has nicotine but it helped break the habit of smoking. It really made it seem effortless...Haven't had a cigarette since New Years Eve after smoking for about 4 years. Soon I'll switch the juice to the ones without nicotine."
"Cold turkey, I've been cigarette free for the better part of 2 years now. I would go out and get drunk, smoke most of a pack, and wake up feeling lie absolute shut in the morning. All you have to do is convince yourself that you hate everything about it and the rest comes easy. After a few days of not doing it, you'll start to notice the horrible smell that it leaves on people."
"I tried many things including e-cigs, but the NJoy ecig in particualr made it easy.  Not as good as a smoke but good enough.  After a few weeks I quit the e-cig... cause it just wasn't satisfying enough.  I still keep it with me though for occasional nicy-fits."
"I tried nicotine gum other products. I also tried a couple different e cigs. The only thing that worked for me was cold turkey. I was getting very tired of smoking all the time so that helped. One day I lit up and after my first drag I said this is it and it was. I've been known to sneak one when I'm at the bars or something, but what's important for me is that I dont smoke habitually and I don't spend shitloads of money on them every week."
"This is going to sound bad, and I don't mean it to degrade anyone's attempts at quitting. This is not advice on how to quit smoking, just my personal experience.
I had tried quitting a few times, stopped smoking for a few months here and there, but always ended up smoking again. After having resigned once more from trying to stop, one night during a party, I drank to the point where I probably had alcohol poisoning. The next day, I had zero desire to smoke at all. It's been probably 6-7 years or so, and I've had a cigarette maybe twice, but it was terrible both times. The desire to smoke went away that night. My guess is I did some damage to my brain, which has been associated with losing addictions."
"Willpower and manual labor/tasks to keep my brain and hands busy.
Best decision ever."
"I used chantix after talking with my dr. However chantix doesn't quit for you. You still have to quit. 
So I got my script for chantix filled and I didn't start. I played it out like a long drawn out break up with a girlfriend. I told myself I was going to do it. Every smoke I told myself I was going to quit. Then I picked my date. Every time I smoked I thought about that date. 
The night of Dec 2 2012 was the night of my break up. I sat out back for about an hour, had a beer and smoked the rest of my smokes. I only had about 3 left.  As I took each drag I reminded myself that it's for the best.  It needs to be over. 
Before I took my last drag I sat there. I stared at the cherry. I smelled the smoke coming off of it. I stared at the filter, the dotted lines on it, the camel writing at the bottom of the cigarette. 
""Well, it was a good run. But I've got a daughter that I've got to kept up with and be able to see grow up."" 
I took my last drag. Held it in a bit longer. Exhaled through my nose. Put out my cig in the ash tray. I collected all my lighters, ash trays, etc and threw them away. The next morning I started my quitting. Chantix is a 3 month treatment, but I only needed it for about 3 weeks. 
It was my 4th attempt to quit. My first time I actually *wanted* to quit.

TL;DR: you have to want to quit"
"Just stop buying packs. You may crave one, but just go out side and have a breath of fresh air, enjoy the outside, then go back to waht ever you were doing. Or when you're smoking think or how gross they taste, the smell wet cigarrets. Personally, I found excessive gaming to be much harder to quit than excessive smoking. 
Most importantly, IMO it's totally fine to have one once and awhile. Just smoke in moderation, if possible. I usually do 1 pack a month. Like excessive alcohol and fast food is bad, but once and awhile isn't going to hurt. A nice cool, crisp ciggaretts isn't that bad once and awhile, perhaps during a cold beer while looking across the lake at your cabin up north, or after a fine filling meal to ease the stomach and cause a hint of relaxation and satisfaction. "
"Health care here too.  This is gonna sound like BS but while working one night one of my patients (admitted for Exacerbation of COPD) kept sneaking smokes in her bathroom.  Rather than scolding her for smoking in the bathroom, I used the old ""smoking with your condition is killing you"" approach.  Her response was ""that's real good advice from someone who smells like a Marlboro when you come into my room"".  Quit cold turkey right then.  Only time quitting ever worked, smoke free 9 years"
"I would go through periods (a few hours) with an intense burning pain inside my chest.  (Imagine sunburn... In your lungs.) I'd also wake up in the night unable to breathe, my partner would be woken up by the rattling sound emanating from my chest and I'd get seriously out of breath during sex. That was was about enough motivation to quit cold turkey.

"I read Allen Carr's Easyway. This is the second time I have quit, but feel really good about it this time. Make sure not to cut down, go cold turkey and be really patient with yourself and others for just one week. After that, it is just a matter of winning little battles until it gets easier."
Nicoderm. Followed all the 3 steps. Have been smoke free for 3 years now. 
"I tried to quit numerous times and thought it was just a hopeless endeavor, but then I really, deeply thought about the reasons I wanted to quit, thought about the future and how much I didn't want it to be filled with the consequences of smoking, and when I had that mental image the conviction to quit came with it. I still craved it, and, almost a year later, I still do, but that conviction is also still there, and it because it is no longer worth the consequences to me, I have remained strong.
"
"I quit via the ""cold turkey"" method. It's been five years and I never even vaguely want a cigarette!  I actually started having more and more trouble breathing, using an albuterol inhaler more and more. I thought that I couldn't keep destroying my lungs like that, I could feel that my lungs weren't functioning at full capacity. But my family doctor told me that the lungs will heal themselves almost completely if you quit smoking cigarettes. So I used those images in my mind to keep me NOT WANTING to smoke while I had the cravings: ""lungs...healing..."". Then eventually the cravings were gone and I was free from the shackles!!! So yeah, you have to want it!  Maybe the trick is finding your own reason to ""want it""?"
"As of writing this, I haven't smoked in 8 days. It's the first time I can recall since I started, when I was 16, that I've gone 8 days without a single puff of a cigarette. I smoked heavily through the end of high school and through college. I'm now 25. 
I could easily kill a pack in a few hours if I was drinking, so Friday and Saturday downtown usually turned into 40 cigarettes in two days. I associated everything in my life with smoking, from driving, to eating, joy, success, failure, loss -- everything. I've known I had a problem for a long time, and have tried everything to quite. Cold turkey, a structured plan to cut down, gum, probably five or six different brands of E-cig (with Blu and Njoy being my favorites), but everything lead back to me smoking again. 
What finally worked for me was the Ego-T electronic vaporizer. It's not in the shape of a cigarette, doesn't mimic the motion of smoking, tastes nothing like a cigarette, and is customizable. That, along with the Livestrong quitting app, which allows you to track when you're craving, allowed me to finally put enough distance between myself and cigarettes. 
The Ego-T was recommended to me by a friend at work who also had been a heavy smoker, though he says he was up to 1.5-2 packs a day. He got the Ego-T and hasn't smoked in two months. That's when I was sold. "
"I just stopped. That's it. I decided that I would NOT allow myself to buy another pack, and I didn't. It sucked for the first 2 weeks. After that, it got easy."
First I stopped smoking in my car. Then I cut way down. Then I prayed about it. I have not smoked a cigarette since that prayer.
"I went to visit a friend in New York and realized I wouldn't be able to afford eating *and* smoking during my visit. I had tried a few times before that with the patch and lozenges, but the idea of paying more than $10 for a pack was the last straw!"
"My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary in Asheville, NC doing the brewery hop thing, and she caught a nasty case of omgwtfisthis.mp4 so I took her to the ER. The lady (I guess) who shared the triage room with us sounded like..instead of breathing air like us normal folks, large icy marbles percolating in her evaporated lungs like those popcorn lawnmowers we had as kids. I didn't quit that very second but I made a plan to and stuck with it. One year clean and no hiccups. Thanks, jiffy-pop lungs."
"Decided on my last pack that when I got to the last cig I'd save it, then drove somewhere scenic and important to me and smoked it, drove away and haven't smoked one since.  Six years.  Failed a few times before the momentous final cig so I'd recommend it if you're a sentimental type at all... If I smoked any cheater cigs after that I'd have ruined the whole experience."
"I had just bought a 3-pack deal at the convenience store. I opened the first pack and was ready to light up when I had the thought ""I need to quit."" I went to the kitchen and got a brown paper grocery bag and set it on the coffee table. One by one I took the cigarettes out of the packs, broke them and dropped them in the bag. 
My roommate came in about halfway through the first pack and said ""What the fuck man, give them to me.""  I said ""Nope, they're mine.""
He sat there and watched me slowly crumble them into the bag. After I had crushed about a pack in front of him he pulled out his smokes and joined me. 
I haven't smoked since and it was over 20 years ago. 
I think the ritualistic breaking the cigarettes is what did it. It made a solid memory of the point in time I chose to be a non-smoker."
The way I quit chewing was just cold turkey. It sucks but it's worth it. it'll be one year in 2 weeks. Haven't cheated once.
"Echo what some others are saying.  You want to quit and just quit.  I smoked for 13 years.  After my grandfather's funeral, I decided it was  time.  I waited until after driving home (I smoked a lot in the car).   I chewed a lot of Altoids gum and used a spinning ring for the manual fixation.  It's been 10 years and haven't touched one since."
"Just passed 5 years without one.  14 years of smoking.
Chantix helped, but it's not a miracle pill.  If you want to quit it will help you.
I also told myself that one day I want to walk my daughter down the isle."
"Smoked for 8 years. Knew I wanted to quit, my car was out of commission for 2 days and I never went to get any or had anyone get smokes for me. From those two days I just quit cold turkey. I didn't really think it was that stressful."
"I stopped cold turkey, I stoped buying, threw my lighters out, chewed gum. "

Great community."
"I quit smoking but it wasn't cigarettes.  I quit smoking pot. I don't care what people say: ""marijuana isn't addictive"", blah blah blah.  I was addicted.  I was abusing it, I was smoking resin when I ran out, and it was getting in the way of living a normal life.  I had withdrawals the first week. Of course, they weren't as bad as heroin withdrawals, but the symptoms of withdrawal were there.  I quit because I decided I didn't want to live that lifestyle anymore.  I cried and then I quit.  This was over two years ago and I still miss it.  I will never be able to smoke pot again,much like an alcoholic or heroin addict, without abusing it."
"""Easy Way To Quit Smoking"" by Allen Carr  for me aswell "
"The hardest part is probably actually wanting to quit. Many people quit because they know it is the right thing to do without actually wanting to. That I believe is the first and most important step. 
After that there were a lot of things that helped me, I tried a lot of things but still had certain triggers. Like you and your work break, my issue was something to keep my fingers and mouth busy. So instead of making sure I had a pack of smokes on me I always had about 5/6 lollipops and if the urge hit me at a time when I would normally have one. For me it was waiting for public transport, if the bus wasnt due for 5-10 mins I would just take out a pop and go through hell until the bus arrived. 
I'm not going to say it gets easy but it does get easier than when you start. Best of luck with your efforts and remember you in 10 years will be forever grateful for the day you decided to quit for good."
I started running honestly because this cute guy was running. I had been trying to quit for 3 months. I did wear a patch for 3 days. After that I went for a run when I wanted a cigarette. I know that is not possible at every time you a cigarette. The physical exertion let my body know that smoking sucked. I found something I wanted to do more than smoking and I married him too:)  
"Honestly, getting sick.  I was sick for a month and couldn't even look at a cigarette.  After I was better, I didn't have any cravings and decided to just quit while I was ahead.  Haven't had a cigarette in three and a half years. "
"It takes loads of sheer willpower to quit. I was helped along by the fact that in my state they had raised the price of a pack to around 10$ but even after that fact it still took a lot of effort. Find a substitute for your oral fixation, sweet gum or hard candy maybe. Tell someone what your trying to do so they can help your efforts to an extent. If you are finding it that difficult to quit maybe nicorette or some other nicotine substitution might be the thing for you. Stay strong and try not to snap at people, I had a terribly short fuse the first few months after I quit."
I was having sex with a women and about five minutes in I was completely out of breath. I quit smoking and started exercising the next day.
"I used something called Chantix. One of the side effects where technicolor action movie dreams so that was awesome. It can cause depression in a low number of people.
The way Chantix works, from what I understand, is that the medicine attaches to the same neuro receptors that nicotine usually attaches to. You don't stop smoking while you takes these but over time Nicotine has less and less affect on you and you addition slowly fades away. Worked like a charm. "
Having a real fear of dying from it. I have a son. And I couldn't stand the thought of leaving him all alone. My dumb ass dying from smoking. 
"I worry a lot, and I worried about getting cancer.
Also I only smoke when I drink, hopefully a few cigarettes a month won't kill me."
Cold turkey. I decided I wanted to quit so I quit.
"Wellbutrin.  It's an antidepressant that has a side-effect of making you quit smoking.  
It's magical.  You start taking it and just smoke like you normally would - except eventually, you just forget that you smoke.  Normally, I'd always light a cigarette while walking outside between classes.  One day, I realized I hadn't done that the last two or three times like I normally would - I'd just forgotten to do it.
I can't imagine a less difficult way to quit, I highly recommend it."
"Electronic cigarette. I had smoked for 14 years at about a pack a day before I quit. My husband and myself bought a house that we didn't want to smell like cigarettes, so we decided we had to do it. We invested in nice ones, not the gas station junk ones. It was a little over $100 for the batteries, juice, charges and cartomizers. The trick was finding the *perfect* juice that hit the spot. It took a while to find one, but now I have a few.
I(as well as my husband) haven't touched a cigarette in 11 months now and I can't stand the smell of them. My brother who had smoked about 16 years quit the same way.
I know some people say the e-cig is like cheating, and we don't really know what's in them...but to me, to get myself away from all the other chemicals in real cigarettes this was the best choice. Now that I'm only addicted to the nicotine, I think it would be a hell of a lot easier to quit completely. "
"Huge sinus infection.  Couldn't breathe or smoke.  After 6 months of misery, and lots of drugs - CURED!  And no desire to start smoking again.  There is
 probably an easier way but it worked for me.
"
"I had smoked for decades and as much as I hated being addicted I truly enjoyed smoking and had no health issues because of it. I was pretty active and would cross country ski or bike for hours often taking a smoke break on long hills but for years it had nagged me that I needed to have those cigarettes and I was spending about three hundred bucks a month on the stuff. One day I found a little book in a used book store. It was ragged and cost me a buck. I read a lot so I took it home and read it in one sitting. A week later I quit cold turkey and I truly was amazed by how painless it was. My wife was amazed and asked how I did it (she had been smoking pretty much all her adult life as well). I gave her the book and a month later she quit cold turkey too and we both have never had another smoke. I never looked back. That was six years ago and I can sit in a room full of smokers and it doesn't bother me. The book is called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. One of the amazing experiences of my life. I wish you success in your endeavour. Cheers
"
"I signed up for an Olympic distance triathlon and started a blog detailing my training and the experiences leading up to the triathlon.  I shared it with all my family and friends who followed my journey to becoming a triathlete.  This provided a significant amount of peer pressure to finish the triathlon.  
And I can tell you, smoking makes triathlon training suck.  A lot.  So I got to the point where I avoided smoking because I knew how much it was going to make my running/swimming/bike training the next day.  
By the time I was a month from the triathlon I had given up on smoking entirely and I haven't looked back since, which has been about 5 years now.
BTW - I smoked a pack a day for over 15 years.
"
"I love smoking the whole act of it.  However, I did quit by chewing a fuckton of gum and mints.  It helps if you actually go away from your work area, which is really what I needed. 
"
"The first week is the hardest part. I was told to go to a sauna every day for the first week, that sweating would help purge the nicotine and make the cravings stop sooner. Worked for me!"
"After 10+ years of puffing and many failed attempts to quit switched to e-cigs three months ago, easy. I might smoke a cig or two once a month at a party or in a bar but that doesn't trigger the smoking habit, rather pushes it back further."
"I only smoked a few years so honestly for me it was not that hard. I just realized I did not like smoking, but rather the addiction and habit make you think you do. I just told myself I had to get over my brain tricking me into wanting one and just recognize it as a tick and not a real desire. I just cold turkeyed it until eventually I could just forget about them."
"To stop smoking cigarets, i started smoking more pot, no jk"
"First realize Nicotine only provides relief from the uncomfortableness it causes.  It does not relax you, it does not mellow you out, it does not make you less anxious, it does the opposite of all of those things and smoking another cigarette only  temporarily relieves the symptoms.  It's a trick that keeps people chained to their nicotine.
Second realize that smoking is unhealthy and you want to be a healthy person.  Putting that crap in your lungs makes it harder to breath and get oxygen into your blood which means its harder to exert yourself, ie exercise.  Instead of going outside to smoke a cigarette, go outside to run around the building or do some push ups.  You will be amazed at how quickly you improve once you quit smoking and you'll still have an excuse to take a break.
Third forgive yourself but don't give up! Most people on here are saying things 'I just decided I didn't want to smoke anymore and stopped', they are kidding themselves, I know a lot of smokers and It's never that easy. It took me 6 months of trying to quit, I tried patches, e-cigs and read a book (The Easy Way to Quit smoking) stopped drinking avoided smokers, in the end it was each one of these things that got me closer and closer until I finally just realized it was easier to quit then keep up with bumming cigarettes or searching through my roommates ashtrays (yes its fucking disgusting). All these people that say they just decided one day are lying because there's not a smoker in the world who doesn't want to quit, yet they keep smoking.  So obviously you have to get yourself to a point where you don't just want to quit but you need to quit.
Its not easy, but its totally doable and afterwards things get so much better you will feel 100% healthier, like you just got 10 years younger. Best thing is now you'll have a good reason to buy that $5 smoothie or the fancy latte or the expensive beer at the bar instead of the cheap stuff because now your saving all that money you would be throwing to the cig companies so reward yourself with something! Good luck!"
"Another vote for cold turkey.  Also I made sure everyone knew when I was going to stop, that way no matter who i was with I had support.  What also helped immensely was trying to cultivate disgust when smoking, i.e. thinking about all the shit going into my lungs with every drag and the harm it was doing to me every time.  By the time quitting time came i was eager to stop and it was consequently much MUCH easier than I'd feared."
"just remember that willpower is a resource.
i stopped cold turkey 10 months ago after 10 years of smoking, and although it was brutal in the beginning, i just kept reminding myself of what i was gaining:
- no more money spent on cigs.
- every cig you don't smoke is more time you'll have with your loved ones in the end.
- http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html --this website helped me look forward to the changes in my body after quitting.
- fingers/breath don't stink like shit!
- everything the top post says."
"I'm sure people have suggested Carr's book, but I thought most of the book was too preachy. One thing that stuck out to me, though, was the idea that quitting smoking is actually not that hard. More specifically, that the notion that quitting is difficult has been strongly reinforced by media in order to increase the sales of nicotine patches, pills, etc. 
A bit conspiratorial, I know. But I coupled that with the understanding that the physical craving actually isn't that bad. I've never woken up in the middle of the night shivering because I needed a cigarette. 
What ultimately did it for me was when I woke up extremely hung over from the night before - too hung over to get out of bed and have a cig. Eventually, it became 18 hours of not having a smoke - the longest I went without one in 3 years. So I just asked myself how long I could keep it up. When combined with the beliefs I outlined above, it was annoying but easier than I expected.  "
I smoked for about a year pretty consistently. I just looked at the money spent and put it away in dollar amount in a  tin and looked at it and said I didn't spend that money today yay. Eventually it added up and I didn't need to do it anymore. 
"One day I came with the conclusion that, sooner or later I would have to stop smoking. That day I got my last cigar, looked at it and said: ""This will be my last cigar ever."" and smoked it like it was indeed the last cigar of my life. This was 3 years ago and after that I never smoked again."
"Hypnosis. Smoked for ten years a pack a day. Walked into the office smoking never smoked again been almost 3 years. You aren't that far under that he could make you cluck like a chicken or anything , you wouldn't take his advice or do anything you don't agree with. All you need is to be open about being able to get hypnotized and willing to try it. Good luck
"
"My mom got hypnotized. She had to go back a few weeks later, but after the second time she never had the urge to smoke again. "
I quit after my dad suddenly died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cancer. 43 years old
"First of all--what I've seen with all of my friends who have tried e-cigs is that they just go back to smoking sooner or later (usually sooner). The hardest part about quitting isn't the nicotine (though that is very hard), it's breaking the hand-to-mouth habit. This is one of the reasons people gain weight after quitting. The oral fixation or compulsion remains, and as it eventually lessens over time your cravings become less harsh.
For me, I smoked 8 years and quit last June. I started with the patch, used it for two weeks before I had a relapse (damn Fourth of July) and went cold turkey after that. So, I am a huge proponent of both the patch and cold turkey! But I don't think I could have made that initial leap without the help of the patch."
"I manned the fuck up one day, threw out my pack, and went cold turkey. Haven't had a cigarette in almost 5 years. Once you get past the first two weeks you are clear, you just need to have willpower. Willpower and distractions. And NO DRINKING."
"Have a good reason and smoke too much- I wanted to start a family and wanted to be healthy - my wife didn't smoke and every attempt I made I failed at once I drank. I went to Las Vegas and stayed up over 24 hours and drank too much smoked over 3 packs and basically made myself sick of the taste and smell of cigarettes - I couldn't breathe properly and was coughing.  I couldn't smoke anymore and that was it - I quit - when I drank or was in social situations, I ate - I gained weight - oh well - that was 20 years ago.  I now run 10km, bike 250km a week, hike high elevations and play hard with my 2 kids. Quitting smoking was the best thing. I had more important things to do in my life than spend money on smokes, be unhealthy and smell like an ashtray."
"1st time (1995, after about 4 years of smoking) - moving to a new house (couldn't smoke inside anymore) + the patch (I was terrified of smoking with it on because I'd heard horror stories)
2nd time (2002, after a six month stumble off the wagon) - my husband knew I had started again, but thought I had quit after only three months.  I was going to have to spend Christmas Day with him the entire day, so I couldn't get away + Zyban."
I quit cold turkey and I was halfway through a cigarette as well. But after 13 years of smoking a pack a day I had mentally built up a level of disgust in myself and my habit. The day I quit I had a cold and that also helped. 
"When i had health insurance, Chantix worked amazingly.  I just so happened to have been graduating at the time, did 3 all nighters in a row, and was caught staring at a computer screen finishing my thesis for 4 hours doing nothing.  and it so happened that my dr. failed to mention that there was a part 2 to the process.  (i did the first month, but didnt follow through with the second month)  Had i did it properly, i know it would have helped me.    
  
but the best way i quit so far, is have a girlfriend that is 100% against smoking and will punish you in every way a girlfriend can.  i promised her i would quit if the giants won the super bowl, and when they did, i quit cold turkey.  it sucked at first, im finishing 2 years with out any.    
  
good luck.  quitting sucks.  but just stay focused and tell yourself that you're better than a stupid pack of cigarettes.  
  
If you have a water cooler, maybe try going there for a cup of water, finish the cup there, then go back to your desk?  then you get to include another moment of break by having to do frequent bathroom stops too.  :)  Again, good luck.  "
"Toothache and E-cigs.
Had really bad toothache for about 4 days and didn't **want** to smoke for that amount of time. After that I started thinking, ""I wonder if I could make it a week."" Then it was ""I wonder if I can make it 10 days"", ""I wonder if I can make it a fortnight"" ""I wonder if I can make it a month"" etc.
Co-incidentally a friend of mine also started an e-cig business not long before this happened so after about a week of cold turkey I started using these for about a month. After an alcohol-related incident that resulted in the demise and breakage of said e-cig, I was fine to go completely without."
"I'll preface this by saying it's not a recommended method, obviously.
I quit successfully by getting horrifically ill with influenza.  I had been trying to quit for years, but never really managed to do it. Then, while visiting a friend in another town, I came down with the flu.
 Apparently I was delirious for over a day, and bed-ridden for another 2 days.  By the time I felt well enough to go outside for a smoke, I was over the worst of the withdrawal.  I did try to smoke anyway, but it hurt so damn much due to my ravaged lungs, I put it out after one drag and never smoked again. "
"I quit smoking cold turkey 164 days ago.  What i found helped was not thinking of it as quitting smoking, but as choosing not to having the next cigarette.  You can easily not have one cigarette, now just make that choice over and over again until you ""quit"". 
I also found that quitting in conjunction with other changes in my life helped.  I quit right before i moved into a new appartment, so i had no ""triggers"" for me to smoke, no more sitting on the front stoop smoking and people watching, no more friend's in the building encouraging me to come out for a smoke and a chat. I have no smoking associations in my new place.  I have never smoked there, and there is nothing there that makes me think of smoking.
You can do this!"
"My wife got pregnant with our son, and I quit cold turkey. One of the hardest things I've ever done, but I want to be around for awhile haha. He's worth it"
"I was driving to work one day and I was out of smokes and I thought to myself ""man, I should stop at the drugstore and get a pack"" and then I just thought ""....no actually. I don't want to smoke anymore"". It's been two years and I haven't gone back. The first month or so was HELL but now I would rather die than light a cigarette. "
"I know this is lame, but after 3 years of smoking regularly, pack in a day or two, one sunny day when I was walking home I just said to myself: ""I'll quit smoking now."" And I did. There was nothing else to it, no particular reasons or anything.
Now after like 6 years or something, Ive started smoking when I'm drunk if my friends have cigarettes. There's that certain appeal to it. But I don't drink very often either."
"I just got sick of waking up every morning with my lungs hurting, and getting bronchitis every single year.
I did the gum for a couple weeks and got sick of using it, gradually scaled back until that was it. Actually it was a pretty short period, that is after smoking a half pack to a pack a day over a 10 year period."
I used champix. It can have side effects but for me it was really successful. Today is actually a year since my last cigarette. 
"I remember asking my grandmother once if she ever missed it (smoking) and she looked me dead in the eye and said "" All the time"". Years later when I started ""quitting"", I remembered what she said, and realized ""once an addict, always an addict"". 5 years later, they mostly disgust me, but sometimes I think I really want one. I just know I can't have one. BTW, the reason for quitting was the birth of my daughter."
"Calculate the amount of money you're handing over over to these evil corporate pricks. It's not like you're paying them for something enjoyable like a holiday, game console, nice food etc. 
They're selling you twigs wrapped in paper laced with chemicals to make them even more addictive. Picture them sitting back in comfy chairs, sipping brandy, while you pay them your hard earned cash because they have fooled you into thinking you need their product. "
"I ended up learning how to juggle instead. Took me about 3 weeks or so to really perfect it, but every time I had the urge to smoke I picked up the balls and started working on them.
"
"This free PDF book was recommended in another forum and no bullshit it works. I read it in one night and quit smoking cold turkey they next day after smoking for over 20 years. it was easy, you just need to know what nicotine is and why you crave it so much. all is explained here: http://media.wix.com/ugd/74fa87_2010cc5496521431188f905b7234a829.pdf
if you are thinking of quitting please spend a few hours and read this, life is so much better smoke free.. there are no add and no bullshit to buy, its just facts and common sense. 
"
"Honestly vaping is the way to go. I was smoking a pack and half a day and as soon as I got an e-cig it went down to 2 cigarettes a day. They're so much better than cigarettes; taste great, no smell and I can smoke inside and around my girlfriend. I tried quitting cold turkey but it just didn't work for me, I loved the act of smoking too much, I don't think I was so much addicted to nicotine as I was to actually smoking, so vaping is perfect for me. "
"e cigs helped me for sure, at least they helped me slowing down and smoking less reg cigarettes. Reading the Sub reddit here did some good as well, but what triggered it was the idea of getting sick and not be able to see my daughter grow up or get married.     
 I recommend joining the GYM, exercising helped me NOT think about smoking... I stopped hanging out with smokers pretty much too, I had to do it :("
Did everything I could to give myself the flu. I never smoked when I was sick so after being sick for a week I just didn't start again.
"10 year smoker.  penis lost some of its power.  no choice, had to quit."
"I [posted a few months ago] about quitting my 3 pack a day habit (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nfqe1/a_year_ago_today_i_was_a_3packsaday_smoker_a_year/) about quitting my 3 pack a day habit , and I'll just paste it here...
I quit through a regiment of cussing, snacking, and bribery.
That voice in your head that tells you you need to smoke is a lying sack of shit. That is not your brain talking. That is your addiction talking. Every chance you get, you tell that little shit to shut the fuck up.
Examples:
**Voice:** YouÛªve had a rough day! How can you be expected to quit on a day like this? You deserve a pack!
**You:** Shut the fuck up, dummy. What I deserve is fancy-ass Digiorno pizza for dinner and two motherfucking king size ReeseÛªs cups for dessert
**Voice:** YouÛªve gone three days without a cigarette! Man thatÛªs pretty good. You know what you should do to celebrate? Pick up a pack or two on the way home!
**You:** Shut the fuck up, asshole! Are you fucking stupid? To celebrate three days of not smoking I am going to go buy a $5 drink from motherfucking Starbucks and then go ogle hotties on the street. Fuck you.
**Voice:** Wow, so five days without smoking. Today was kind of rough, huh? You should take it easy, you know? Go pick up a pack, ease into this quitting. Just step it down. ItÛªs not like anybody knows youÛªre trying to quit, except one or two people. And everyone kind of expects you to just keep smoking anyway.
**You:** Shut. The Fuck. Up. Bitch almighty of the planet Dumbfuck, just shut your ignorant fucking hole.
**Voice:** Look at you! You made it a whole week without smoking! Holy shit! Can you believe it? Those assholes thought youÛªd never make it. You sure showed them! Boy, glad thatÛªs over. Welp, nowÛªs as good a time as any to go pick up a pack!
**You:** Shut the fuck up! Are you fucking stupid? This isnÛªt going to happen. WhatÛªs going to happen is me and my pajamas and this 2 pound bag of Jolly Ranchers and you shutting the fuck up, idiot.
**Voice:** You could just have one. No one would blame you.
**You:** I would blame me, you weak fucking sack of shit. Shut the fuck up.
**Voice:** Damn, donÛªt you take breaks at work any more? You just come in here, clock in, stay inside all day. DonÛªt you want to go outside? IÛªm sure you can find a co-worker to bum you a smoke.
**You:** You fucking twerp. Leave me alone. I - wait. Yeah, outside sounds fine. IÛªm heading out for some Starbucks. Nice try, idiot.
I also bribed myself. A bribe for each non-smoking day, each non-smoking week, each non-smoking month, and at six months, and at a year. Examples:
Every day: an app or song, or something around $1. Sometimes IÛªd just go into a dollar store and see whatÛªs up.
Every week: Something around $15, a book or album (I was starting to listen to the blues and thatÛªs kind of a hassle to get your hands on in an instant-gratification sort of way. I live in Chicago; it's pretty easy to find in a store here.)
Every month: Something around $50-60: going out for a nice dinner, a new article of clothing, a video game, whatever.
At six months: Something around $150
At one year: TBD, but it looks like IÛªll be picking up a cheap little tablet.
So, when youÛªre struggling with falling off the wagon, when ÛÏjust oneÛ sounds like a good idea, or when ÛÏI deserve a cigaretteÛ is pounding in your brain, just remember: you deserve better than a smoke, and that little voice is slowly trying to kill you. You're better than this, and you're gonna be fine.
**Edit** Another thing that really helped was that I'd put my milestones on Facebook, Twitter, etc. It didn't matter if it was a 3-month milestone or just some random day (""104 days of no smoking!""), the positive feedback from people I actually knew in real life was a big help, too."
"Swimming. I found it extemely therapeutic.  The breathing control needed for swimming really helped me deal with stress and lung recovery.  I also found that I enjoyed the satisfaction of beating peraonal bests, if I smoke it hugely affects my performance so that was a major factor when for me when gaced with an opportunity to have a cigarette. "
"I knew that I wanted to stop, so I stopped purchasing cigarettes, but I would bum them off people at parties etc.  Then finally I moved to a new town away from everyone I knew who smoked, and by the time I went back home I had lost all desire to smoke. I guess just not being around smokers really helped."
"cutting down on alcohol + getting sick of feeling like garbage. cigs caused me alot of stomach/esophagus issues, plus feeling generally rundown. once I quit I felt better. "
"After trying 7 - 8 times to go cold turkey without any mental or emotional preparation, I made a determination in July of 2011 to quit on November 1st, 2011. During those few months I had a conversation with myself every time I had a cigarette about how it was going to be one of my last ones. By the time I reached October 31st, I didnt even really want one anymore. I've been cig free ever since. I think the mental preparation and planning in advanced definitely helped me."
"I tried cold-turkey a couple times, and always went back to smoking after a week or two. The patch is finally what did it for me; though it's success rate is documented to be fairly low. Wearing the patch took the edge off the transition period, but personally it was avoiding nicotine poisoning which kept me from smoking. Even if you rip the patch off and go outside to smoke, the extra nicotine is still in your system, so that smoke is going to make you feel extra woozy. It wasn't something I could tolerate at work, so that's how I was forced to form new habits. 
It took almost 2 months before I stopped getting up from my desk to go outside and smoke every time I finished to most minuscule little task. But once I was over that, I eventually just began forgetting to put the patch on in the morning, and then I was all done."
"Congratulations on wanting to quit enough to reach out. Wanting to quit bad enough to express that desire is definitely a prerequisite to succeeding. I quit 11 months ago, and this time it's permanent. I bet having several nagging factors makes it easier. For me the main factors were my two little toddlers asking why I was going outside to 'blow fire' instead of staying inside to play. Best of luck. You'll feel great when your out of the woods. Remember also: quitting is not as hard as the industry wants you to believe. "
"Before you continue to read this is completely serious. Smoking marijuana actually helped me quit cigarettes. Id tell myself, if you smoke a ciggy now at work then you can't smoke weed when you get home. I found that I liked smoking weed 100x better then cigs cause I just felt so much better afterwards. Though it does take a lot of willpower cause you really gotta believe that you won't let yourself smoke weed if you smoke a ciggy. But anyway good luck brother, hopefully you will join the ranks of the nicotine-free soon!"
"Accept the desire to smoke. Don't smoke regardless. You are a human being with free will. You don't punch people that annoy you either. Because you decide what you do. Realize you have the power over your actions, and act like you are a grown person."
"You did not get addicted to tobacco overnight. Why is it, that you expect to quit overnight? Quitting is a slow process. give yourself some time. Set a small daily goal, (1 less cigarette per day, perhaps?) don't be so hard on yourself, when you don't meet that goal. (you're not a failure! You're still trying.) Be reasonable and remember that the physical effects of withdrawal are very real. They are not in your head, but actually, in your body. Different organs in your body are not receiving the nicotine that they've become use to and will act accordingly. Pains, aches, sweats are real manifestations of withdrawal.
Patches, gum and e-cigs are good to a certain extent, but are you trying to stop putting smoke in lungs or do you want to break your addiction to nicotine. It's like asking a heroin-addict, ""Are you just trying to stop using needles, because you could always just switch to pills..."" 
(Last edit, I promise!) As an ex-nurse, I ask this: Are you taking breaks, so that you can smoke or are you smoking, because you need to take a break? With me, it was always the latter. That time, right there is a good chance to skip that 1 or 2 cigs that day."
"Champix did it for me (I believe it is called different in USA, but just can't remember what it is)"
"Finding out my gf at the time (now wife) was allergic to smoke.  Obviously, this isn't an easily repeatable method."
I actually had to try meditation there were so many times the urges became overwhelming I'd have to pause what I was doing collect myself recognize my brain has been hijacked by a chemical substance forcing me to do things I didn't want to do.  It helps that no one at my house smokes.  I smoked for 7 years and haven't for about 2 years now
Stop buying cigarettes.  
I got pregnant. It gives you real motivation to quit.
Planning on quitting for my birthday in 2 weeks. This thread is a huge morale boost. Thanks to all who shared
"I took some fire MDMA and smoked two packs of reds in 12 hours
I couldn't taste for a week"
"My stepfather tried for years to quit smoing. He tried patches, gum, those weird lozenges.. Nothing seemed to work. One day he started having one of his coughing fits. This was all too normal, since he had been smoking for some forty years. I noticed though, that he started going into the bathroom to hide his coughing. It didn't dawn on me to ask him why. He'd always coughed in front of us before. Turns out, he was coughing up blood for about a week before it got bad enough that he went to the emergency room. 
He went to a couple of specialists after a lot of testing. They found a small capsule in his lungs, which contained SOMETHING, but they couldn't tell you what. The capsule was filled with a disease that his body was unable to fight off, so his lungs encapsulated it instead. The doctor said he had seen this once before and that it was TB. GREAT. 
What caused the bleeding is that the capsule was sitting on a cluster of capillaries and these would burst when he began coughing.
Oh, and another thing.. if he kept having fits like that, the bleeding wouldn't be a big deal, but the capsule could burst and whatever disease that is in there would be released into his body.
GREAT. So he either had to quit smoking immediately, or get Tuberculosis and die at some random point in time. (His immune system was shot and he probably wouldn't have survived.)
His words, ""Well, they've kept me in this damn hospital bed without a cigarette for four days, may as well stop now while I'm ahead.""
He never picked up another cigarette. It's been 3 years. 
**TLDR:**quit smoking or get tuberculosis."
"I'm currently a smoker at the moment because I work full time, go to school full time and there is only so much coffee one can drink in a day before you start hearing colors.  I know it's an excuse, but they keep me going at the moment.  But I plan to quit on April 6th of this year, which happens to be my last day of school.  I had a physical and everything was good, except my cholesterol.  Smoking, naturally, needs to go by the wayside to get that back in check.  
He asked me what I planned to do about quitting and I told him an e-cigarette.  He approved since it stimulates the physical addiction to cigarettes and causes spikes in nicotine levels, just like real cigarettes do while patches and gums give you a steady level throughout the day.
I have a blu e-cigarette and although it does provide nicotine and helps with the physical habits, it's like eating nothing but vegetables when you're used to eating a fat piece of steak; never satisfied.  
Cold turkey is the name of the game and so many of you here have done it that way.  My brother also quite cold turkey using gum.  Looks like on April 6th, I'll be taking a temporary trip to asshole rage land."
"Chantix.  Smoked pack and a half a day for 15 years.  Tried quitting many times and the only thing that worked was chantix.  Been smoke free for the past 3 1/2 years.
"
"Cold Turkey, just do it and don't want it and tell yourself you don't want it, after awhile, you don't"
This thread is making me want a smoke. Hahaha. I'm not quitting but I'm sick so my cravings are way down.
I smoked for ten plus years. What worked for me was a combination of chantix and flavored toothpicks. The chantix reduced my urge to smoke and the toothpicks got me over my oral fixation. You will also need to replace behaviors you associated with smoking. For me the hardest part was not smoking with my morning coffee
"Champex. Totally worked. High risk, high reward. "
Champix. 
"It took me a long time to quit... like, 30 years.  Gradually the health problems started taking their toll.  I have stage II COPD now and I was finding that my enjoyment of life, including smoking, was diminishing.
  
For about the last year before I quit, I found that if I only smoked the smokes I really wanted... you know, waiting until after the initial surge of habit/nic-fit... I could hone down my smoking to only 2-4 a day.  Banning inside smoking at home helped too, since going outside often involves dressing for the weather (we have no sheltered outside smoking spot).  Still, if I drank I smoked, and then regretted it the next day.  
  
Last year (2012), heading into the Xmas holidays I was thinking of once again trying to quit.  Perhaps after the holidays... maybe after my 48th birthday in February.  Then on Christmas, I caught a bad cold, perhaps even the flu, from my niece or nephew, and for a week I was fucked up.  Couldn't even smoke, because smokes tasted disgusting... plus they just made me cough more.  The next thing I knew, New Years had come and gone, and I was  10 days smoke free.  Rather than starting again, just to quit in a month, I decided to just go with it, cold turkey.
  
The first 3 months were hard.  I honestly didn't want to smoke, but I was angry and depressed a lot of the time.  Some of that might have had to do with the Winter doldrums, though.  I had to change my routines a bit, too.  Not so much partying, or when I did, leaving earlier than normal.  Got a bit hermit-y for a while there, but I'm mostly over it.  
  
I've gone 13 months without smoking now, and feel a lot better about myself, my health and life in general.  I can even have drinks in the presence of smokers, and feel no need at all to light up.   Now if I could only convince my wife to quit.
  
tl;dr  Got sick, couldn't/didn't want to smoke while I was sick... when I was well again, I found I had a stretch of non-smoking under my belt, so I just decided to go for it.  Cold turkey."
Eventually I just didn't want to anymore. I guess I got lucky
"To put it simply, I just got angry.  It was my third time to attempt, first two times with patches, and gum.  One day I came to the realization that I was angry with myself for putting me in the situation where I got sick two times a year for no reason other than smoking, and I was driving myself to an early grave smoking 2 packs a day.  I just quit and worked through it with no external stimuli.  It's been 7 years, and I've only had one cigarette in that time."
"I quit both smoking and caffeine at the same time. Being a coffee addict too, this was doubly difficult.
The result was that I was too focused on the idea of not having caffeine, that the idea of not having cigarettes was being ""masked"" by that. I rewarded myself with Coca-Cola and espresso coffees after a week and felt great relief from that."
"I truly wanted to quit.  I didn't do it because people told me I should;  I quit smoking because I wanted to.  After I established that mindset I bought a disposable e cig that lasted me a week.  I didn't replace it after it ran out but kept it as a pacifier to puff on when I had an urge to smoke.   
I still miss the feeling of smoke filling my lungs and still love the smell of fresh cig smoke  but enjoy my lack of hacking, nic fits, smokey clothes, heavy breathing more.  "
"I quit smoking the day my son was born. I figured if I couldn't do it for him, then I couldn't do it. Haven't smoked a cigarette in 11 years despite constant exposure. 
The point is, you need to be ready you have to want to quit. Nothing works until you want it to. "
"I started smoking when I was 13 as an occasional smoker and by the time I quit at 28 I was up to 40 cigarettes a day - and more when I was drinking.  I tried on several occasions to quit, but kept going back.  The only method I ever tried was cold turkey.  The only thing that did it for me was moving from Japan to Canada.  I was used to paying $2 for a pack and in Canada it was closer to $10.
6 years later, I still miss it, but I would never go back.  It was way too hard to quit and I don't want to have to go through that again.
I've heard that having a change in your life that alters your routines helps a lot."
"I just stopped wanting to smoke, and I was one of the biggest addicts. I'd smoked since 13 years old. I was sitting at my PC and I looked at a cigarette in my hand and thought, this really is a fucking ridiculous habit, why do I still do it? I threw the pack in the bin and never wanted a cigarette again. That was 8 years ago now."

Moving from Eastern Europe to Western Europe. 
"Smoking 3 packs in one day, making sure i always had a smoke in my mouth all day, after that i puked and never smoked again
"
"Replace it with masturbating. This is what i did. Way more fucking rewarding. 
Only downside. I cant stop masturbating. "
"Not being allowed to smoke in the house and living on the 4th floor with no elevator. 
Not being able to smoke at work and being on the 15th floor. 
Not being able to smoke in any public place, at all, ever.
Getting an x-ray from my doctor that noted pleural changes consistent with long-term smoking use and being told that in addition to my heart condition (SVT), if i kept smoking I'd probably be dead by 45. 
That, combined with my increasing inability to do things i like, like paintball, etc., was a no brainer. Once i *wanted* to quit, it was easy. It's *wanting* to quit that is hard for smokers - knowing you should sometimes ain't enough."
"My Dad did it back in 2001ish so a lot of the stuff available now wasn't there for him.  However he tried everything available at the time, the patches, the therapy/ group shit, I can't remember the rest but I know he exhausted all options...  Eventually he just did it cold turkey but his trick was to tell himself that he wasn't quitting just taking a break and that on the day of his retirement he would go out, buy a pack and smoke them all.  He told me of another lady who did the same sort of thing but kept an unopened pack in a table in her foyer, just in case she wanted it and that she lost her shit a few years later when someone threw them out and she had to immediately run to the store for a new pack.  Just to have them...
He says that the first little while was the hardest and that he had days where he wanted to kill for a smoke but that after a while it got easier.  He can still tell instantly if someone enters the house and has had a smoke in the past 5 or 10 minutes though and is now really sensitive to cigarette smoke.  Its like a mild allergic reaction (sore throat, snotty nose, watery eyes) when he gets too close to it or is in a house where people have been smoking inside.
Good luck in quitting!  Or taking a long break from it, however you end up thinking about it..."
"Sorry if it's been said. But e cigs are becoming a great method for people to stop. They use vapor instead of smoke and a deliciously flavored liquid that only has nicotine in it. This means no carcinogens and because you aren't smoking, you're vaping, there isnt damage to teeth and lungs. The reason why these are good for quitting, is the liquid nicotine has different strengths. What you can do is start at the highest and slowly work your way down to 0mm nicotine. It's been incredibly effective with my friends and other colleagues. "
"I'm on hour 63 as I type this.  What everyone has said is true.  You have to want it for reasons that are only personal to you.  Prep yourself for it though.  I have toothpicks or straws to knaw on.  Almonds and gum as well.  I take walks when I would normally smoke so I can still keep the habit but in a healthy way.  It also takes care of the trigger.  I am drinking lots of tea and water and trying to eat healthy items.  Try to stay away from caffeine and booze if possible as they will induce a trigger.  It really is easier than you think but the triggers are what really get ya.  Once you get past that momentary trigger you are good to go until the next one.
You can do it!  It really is easier than you think it will be."
"Find a reason stronger than the addiction.  Vanity for me was never enough.   It should be personal and strong, sort of like a Petronas from Harry Potter.
The idea of my failing health when I am older and the inability to fully  interact with my son and wife.  Punishing them for my selfishness.   This was my mental image. 
I smoked from 12 to 27.  My 33 birthday is this week so been off for 5.5 years now."
"I had ended up moving to another state.  I was in a place where I hadn't already had bad habits associated with certain places or activities.  I'd also left behind my family and friends, most of whom are smokers.  So, a new environment worked for me."
"The most important thing is to UNDERSTAND that 90% of the things you love about smoking are things related to ADDICTION. You are addicted, and you go into drawback... similar to every other drugs...
For example: You talk about the breaks... I am a med-stundent, last year ( 6th )... and i do study a lot... I was afraid that smoke breaks are the only way to relax... THEYARE NOT!! Since i quitted smoking, i realised that i needed those brakes not to relax... but to smoke. You will NOT MISS THOSE BRAKES. If you really want the break, you could still fallow your collegues, or just do something else, like look through the window for a few minutes thinking,reflecting, meditating... not feeding and silencing an addiction.
How I really did it ?:
Well, Really wanted to quit.... Failed 100 times .... Read Alan Carr book.... Stopped trying to quit.... 1 year passed, and I said, I will go to the dentist, get my teeth cleaned on monday morning, get home and stop smoking because i WANT this, and because < Insert Alan Carr reasoning > ...cold turkey.
First 2 day: Nightmare... I was walking arround the house, doing nothing, i felt like shit... I woke up at night sweating
Day 3->5: I felt like smoking every 2 hours, but nothing compared to the first two days
Day 6->14 I felt like smoking maybe 3 times per day but i could ignore it faster
Day 14->Day 45: I felt like smoking maybe 1-2/day... But if i passed the initial impulse, the craving would go away.
It's been 3 months now and i almost don't feel like smoking at all with the only exception beeing when i go out at bars/ parties. But if i manage to say no at the first impulse, it goes away.
Hope this helps, good luck.

"Not me, but my husband. 
I was pregnant. He had a habit of smoking inside. We lived in Chicago and it was the middle of winter. I nagged him until he quit. He was crankier than my pregnant ass for two weeks, but he stuck to it. "
"Can confirm.  One day, I was smoking, and I realized I wasn't getting anything out of the experience, so I quit cold turkey."

"My girlfriend of almost 2 years doesnt smoke.  I was a smoker for the last 14 years. I decided one morning I didnt want to smell that way anymore.  I didnt want her to kiss me with my smokey breath.  I started off by buying a E cig. The first 3 weeks sucked the most.  The E cig just wasnt giving me what I needed.  Then I started telling myself ""just stick with it, your body is kicking all those toxins of real cigarettes.ÛÏ  Before I knew it, I was craving less and less, up to today, where I have been smoke free for 6 months with zero cravings.  My best advice is you HAVE to be ready.  If you arent 100% committed and ready, I wouldnt try. Its always great ro have a support system.  My girlfriend was very encouraging and just one look at her beautiful face and I remembered why  was doing what I was doing"

"i quit when i felt really sick of it. i just didnt want to anymore. but i feel like the real key is psychological and as someone who has quit meat and dairy in his life, amongst other things, I've become pretty good at quitting. 
Here's my key: It will feel shitty to not do it for a while. Then gradually it will feel really good to not do it. You have to make it over that hump. Once you do, you will wonder why you ever smoked in the first place. You will smell it on other people and it will be totally obnoxious. "
"I smoked 7 years and then quit using will power alone over a 6 week period. Heres how. The first quit lasted a week. The second quit lasted a month, The third quit was forever. Here is the secret. There is only one thing that works: Practice. You have to practice any skill to be good at it, right? Well, quitting smoking is no exception.. You have to practice quitting smoking to be good at quitting smoking ?Ê_?Ê. You have to know how it's going to feel, what kind of emotions are going to come out. What it is like after a day, a week. Give yourself the space you need to experiment with a couple of practice quits. Analyze how you feel and react to circumstances and situations. Think deeply about how to overcome the negatives that are paired with those reactions. Once you know how your body and mind will react, then the real quit will be a breeze because you won't be succeptable to all those reactions that the ""cold turkey"" people aren't prepared for. Hope that helps ?Ê_?¡?Ä"
"I started smoking in 8th grade and quit at 26 years old.  
I read Allen Carr's Easyway To Stop Smoking.  I didn't quit because of the book, but I couldn't have quit without it.  A few weeks after reading, I had mouth surgery and couldn't smoke for a couple of days.  I realized that the book put me in the right mindset and this was the opportunity to quit cold turkey.
The first 2-3 days were pure hell and the first week wasn't a whole lot better.  You have to just suck it up and grind through the first week or two.  
After that, the chemicals are out of your system and it's purely a mental game.  Nicotine addiction isn't a very strong physical addiction, but mentally it is really tough.  I remember the amazingly cheesy, but useful acronym: N.O.P.E. - not one puff, ever.  We, as smokers, know that one puff will lead to two, which leads to a cigarette and eventually a pack.  If that wasn't the case, we never would have started smoking in the first place.  Maybe one day I can risk a smoke again, but I have a feeling that when that day comes I won't want to.
It has been 261 days since I last had a smoke.  I still periodically get ""cravings,"" but they are nothing like before.  They come every couple of days and I don't feel the cravings throughout my entire body.  They last for only a few seconds and I can brush them away like a fleeting thought.
tldr; Read book, sift through the bull shit feel good text and focus on the useful information.  Adjust mindset to one conducive to quitting (i.e., People were never meant to smoke.  Normal people are happy without cigarettes.  You will feel this some day).  Pick date to quit.  N.O.P.E.  Profit?"
"I just quit myself and not by any means you'd want to copy but maybe!  I went three days cold turkey and just before I could cave in and smoke I got the flu.  That made me not able to physically smoke for like a week and a half so that point I had gone two weeks.  I still maybe burn one with my buds if we're severally inebriated but that's it.  No smoking at work, no smoking in the car or daytime in general.  I wish you luck sir and if you truly run out of ideas just go ahead and get some influenza. "
my wife smoked for 30 years.  She used the patch to quit.  She tried chantix several years ago but it made her too nauseated to stay on it.

"I quit cold turkey. Just stopped smoking one day, and that was it. I myself didn't ever have cravings, or need one as some people do when they wake up, after a meal, etc. I have also been able to avoid it when drinking. Just not my bag anymore. I quit because I wanted to, I used to enjoy it. I have nothing against anyone who does smoke, I just wanted to do it for myself, for now and the future. Three years btw."
"Early days here, 2 months, but it was a health scare unrelated to smoking. I was stuck in the hospital during winter and the thought of going outside for a smoke was too much. Plus I had a bunch of other things going on so that was a distraction. They offered the patch, but I declined. The morphine and diazepam seemed to be enough. I still crave a cigarette, but not nearly as much as the first few weeks. I have been good about rewarding myself with all the extra money I have to keep motivated. I am pretty certain it will stick this time. It is not easy, but the benefits become tangible and you need to reinforce your mind with them. A little known fact my doctor told me about quitting is that you are more prone to illness like colds for the first year. Something to do with your body chemistry being messed up. There are still plenty of good and essential reasons to butt out."
"I still love smoking.  I started when I was 16.  Smoked pack a day to age 21 or so.  Quit cold turkey for about 4 years.  Started up again for a year because I moved and it was a way to make friends (talking outside a bar and smoking).  Quit cold turkey again for another 8 years.  Recently traveled internationally and smoked 1/2 pack a day for the 15 days I was gone bc fuck it, I was on vacation and just it seemed necessary given the circumstances.  Quit cold turkey before boarding airplane home.  Haven't smoked since and it's been 6 months or so.
I don't know why I am able to quit so easily.  Those first 48-72 hours can be tough.  After that it's all a mind game.  What it really comes down to though is that you will always love the idea of smoking (it's relaxing, it's social, it's cool), but your desire to smoke is all in your head.  It's easy to convince yourself to do it.  What you have to do is develop resolve.  Firm, unflinching resolve.  Make the choice and stick with it.  Patches, pills, hypnosis are all unnecessary and I think only serve as a crutch, not a solution.  You have it in yourself to just quit.  It's so easy to not purchase cigarettes.  You have to recognize the urge and beat it to death in your mind, each and every day for the rest of your life.  You will NEVER not have the urge in the future.  It will always come back.  My dad told me he smoked for less than 2 years in college, and even then, not like I did (pack a day).  He was an amateur smoker.  He says that after a really great meal, with a nice glass of wine, he still gets the urge to light up and he hasn't smoked in 40 years.  Accept this fact.  When the urge comes on you, distract yourself.  Look at yourself in the mirror and say, not today.  Immerse yourself in work.  You don't need a break when working.  You can work through that shit.  I promise you, each day it gets a little easier.  It will always take work though.  I'm writing this and I'm like, yea, cigarette sounds good.  Once I hit save, I'm not smoking because, when it comes down to it, I really don't want to smoke, and neither do you.  Get in your head and beat that demon to death and then go out and enjoy life.  All the best..."
"When cigarettes broke the $3.00 a pack cost, I realized with my pack a day habit it was costing me about $100.00 a month. 
I handed the pack back, kept my $3.00 and never smoked again.
Sit down and figure out how much it's costing you, and find something that you REALLY want that you could spend that money on. "
This doesn't answer your question but I recently quit dipping tobacco. What helped me was coffee pouches. A popular brand is getgrinds.com. Those that do chew or dip try this stuff it's great
"I was just listening to a RadioLab show (it's a podcast/NPR radio show) and there was a woman on there who made a deal with a friend that if she ever smoked again she would donate $5000 to the KKK. The woman was a civil rights activist and obviously super anti-KKK so this was making the negative side effect of smoking something that would be realized in the short term instead of something that could be justified away.
[Here](http://www.radiolab.org/story/117291-you-v-you/) is a link to the episode, they'll obviously explain it much better than I can."

"I quit by replacing cigarettes with something else while doing a specific activity.  In my case, I played EverQuest all the damn time and smoked 2 packs a day, Marlboro Reds too!  I replaced my cigs with Krispy Kreme donuts.  After I chewed down a dozen in one day, I didn't pick up smoking again after that.
To this day I cannot eat a Krispy Kreme, but it's not so bad.  I saved my lungs :)"
"I made up a little reward system for myself. When I decided to quit smoking, I had just picked up DJing as a hobby. This was back before computers and CD players were common, so records were the only way to go, and were expensive as hell. I basically made a deal with myself that every time I went three days without having a cigarette, I would by myself a new record. This essentially represented the money that I would have been spending on cigarettes had I been smoking. I would often 'save up' my money from not smoking, and then hit a record store at the end of the month and buy myself a big stack of fresh new records. as a broke student, it was really satisfying to watch my record collection grow much faster than it otherwise would have.
The great thing is that if you slip up, you don't start again from scratch. You just don't get to treat yourself to whatever replacement you pick that week. I don't think I actually slipped up once.
tl;dr: find yourself something that costs about the same as smoking that you can buy yourself regularly, but wouldn't otherwise be able to afford."
"Dude, same boat. I gave up smoking for the new year and it is so goddamn hard. Best friends smoke, half my coworkers smoke, family smokes. Its everywhere. I have three weeks without a slip up and it's killing me. 
Edit: Mobile missed a few words."
"Stop buying cigarettes. It's hard, but it's the only way."
"E cigarette, all the benefits of nicotine without the smoke. You may want to head over to /r/electronic_cigarette  . There are good electric cigarettes and bad ones. "
"It's simple. If you're looking for similar alternatives to smoking a cigarette, you're gonna end up going back to it sooner or later. This is why I never tried e-cigarettes. I stopped as soon as I moved into my first apartment with my wife. I even made sure it had a balcony where I could smoke my cigarettes. A day or two after moving in I got really sick and had a sore throat for days. This kept me away from cigarettes for a few days. As soon as I recovered, I decided I didn't want to smoke anymore. The sickness may have not been related to smoking in the first place, but subconsciously it made me think I was more vulnerable to it because of smoking. I threw away a brand new carton I had recently bought and haven't smoked in over 6 months. Your body quickly learns to refuse it and even the smell starts to annoy you.
tl;dr : got sick, blamed it on smoking, haven't smoked since. "
"Wellbutrin. Took it for depression, stopped smoking the first day I was on it and never started again. To this day I'm not even sure what happened, I just stopped."
smoking weed (a lot of it) for two weeks.
Decided to wait until tomorrow to have my next cigarette. I haven't given up. Just going to smoke tomorrow. Started thinking that a few years ago now. Still not smoking.
I have not smoked in five years.  I had tried twenty times before and the only thing that was really different was that in my head I knew it was over.  All of the other times I had said I would quit for two weeks or a month and then...  This time I knew it was forever.  I think you really have to want it and most smokers don't.  That is why they fail.
"Simple. Wanting to, then deciding to. Once those two things are in place, it isn't too hard. Don't beat yourself up if you have one, or fall back in to the habit. Learn your triggers, move on and correct course. Took me about a year to be smoke free, but it worked better than lying to myself or beating myself up."
You have to want it. Also it helps to remember that you are owned by only your thoughts.
"I have some tips for you I got from a stop smoking ""class"" which worked for me.  This was to wean us off them without the panic some feel of just quitting cold turkey.
Keep and index card and rate how bad you want one from 1-4, 4 being the most
Smoke something you don't normally smoke such as non-menthol if you smoke menthol, light cigarettes in you smoke regulars and don't ever buy your favorite.  Get the worst cigarettes you can.
Keep your cigaretts and/or lighter in another room, the fridge, your car so you have to get up and think about getting one
Stike a match and blow it out slowly.  (This was a real comfort to me!)
Drink a glass of water
Brush your teeth
After 10 days of this I was through smoking.  I was a 3-pack a day smoker too."
I got pregnant.
"After failing many times smoking for five and a half years or so I finally figured out my way.
Keep in mind my way worked for me and might not you.
I started about 6 months before actually quitting.  I stopped buying cigs and started bumming off people.  By not having my own cigs around I eliminate my ability to smoke of my own free will.  I only smoked when other people were around.  After about 4 months of buying cigs off of friends I started buying my own packs again but was much better at waiting between cigs and wasnt chain smoking.  Then once winter hit I got my yearly cold/flu (LIKE CLOCKWORK) and I just quit cold turkey.  Since I was already suffering due to the flu I wasnt even concerned about cigarettes.  I havent had a single puff since 10/30/13.  I feel great and its getting easier to curb cravings by the day.  Its nice because you can really feel your progress as the chest feeling I would get when I wanted a cigarette gets less and less powerful by the day"
