1,Not relapsing. Seems like the obvious answer but it's really hard not to relapse when your brain constantly tries to find excuses to smoke.

1,"""Missing cigarettes."

1,"Nah but seriously, it’s aside from the sensation it’s just having something to do. It seems like a very different experience walking down the road without a cig than with one. You’re not speaking up, holding anything, flicking ash, bringing your hand up and down to your mouth."

1,"That’s why vapes have been a godsend to me. I don’t even need nicotine, it’s just the sensation of the action I miss."""

1,"""There's a couple things most people have trouble with when quitting that make it harder.  First, you have to actually want to quit. I know from experience that many times I tried to quit I didn't want to quit, I was trying to quit because everyone was telling me to. Second, just because you stumble doesn't erase your progress. Smoking a cigarette after a couple days doesn't mean you've failed, we're fallible. Don't throw your hands up and give up because you fell to temptation. Continue trying. Addiction is a beast, but we're animals that thrive in adversity. """

1,"""Someone I work with is trying to switch to a healthier lifestyle, had been trying for a long time before she realized that slipping up once doesn't erase all the progress you've made. Same thing I had to learn when I tried to go a year without drinking. And this is probably the best advice for trying to overcome anything."""

1,"""The part about slipping up is the real key.  My wife and I quit 4 or 5 years ago I really can't remember exactly when."

1,We both went cold turkey. We do still pick up a pack of smokes if we are going out to drink and know we will be drunk.  A night out heavily drinking which we only do once a month or every other month we might split a quarter pack and then just give the pack to one of our smoker friends when we leave.

1,"I LOVE smoking.  Reason: It makes me feel good.  I hate smoking, it tastes terrible, it makes me cough, it costs so much money, I am often smoking alone, outside in the cold nowdays.  It fucking sucks.  But it makes me feel good.  It's so relaxing.  A few hours without a cigarette is painful."

1,"Addiction is more than a beast, it's a fucking monster.  It warps your brain into loving the feeling of being gross."

1,"I know it's gross, I know it's slowly killing me, I know it stinks, I know it costs me a lot of money...but my brain doesn't care."

1,"The way I see it: My body tortures me when I deprive it of nicotine.  So I smoke to feel normal, not because I want to feel the relaxing effect, but because that relaxing effect, is what normal used to be."

1,"""> you have to actually want to quit"

1,"""So I just fell into this, accidentally quitting smoking because of a cracked rib.  I think about a certain look on peoples' faces at AA meetings, the ones that said, """"I'm only doing this bullshit because I have to do this bullshit.""""  It's the same thing."

1,"However, I've managed to stick with it because this isn't the first time I've quit, and something I noticed the last time I quit (for about three years) seems pretty important."

1,"That feeling you get when you want to smoke a cigarette after you've quit smoking?  That twitchy, ancey, can't scratch that itch feeling?  It's the exact same feeling you get just before you light up a cigarette.  In other words, you actually experience that addict's separation MORE AS A SMOKER than you do as one who has quit.  After a couple of weeks the urges hit me only a few times a day instead of twenty, when I was actually smoking."

1,"It's still bullshit, though.  I didn't want to quit and every single day I can think of good reasons to go back and enjoy myself.  I think if I can stick with it another month or so I'll be fine.

1,Yup. Smoked about a pack in total in the 3 months after I quit. But haven't smoked in 4 years now.

1,I second this completely. You have to want to. Like properly have to. No pretending to yourself. I smoked for 10ish years and knew I wanted to stop by the time I turned 30. I wanted to stop. It's almost a state of mind

1,"""The first one is very true. I just don’t have the motivation within myself to want to quit."

1,"""I feel like there's a certain level of shame you have to hit before you can really commit to it. I was never a big smoker, but spent a long time as a can-per-day chewer. What compelled me to quit was something my 2 pack-per-day neighbor said to me. We were out on our porches, he was smoking and I was chewing. He told me, """"seems like every time I see you there's something in your lip"""". Holy shit that hit me hard. My chain smoking neighbor notices my tobacco habit? It must be bad. I was able to quit within a couple weeks of then and it's been almost 3 years now."""

1,"""Absolutely this. I can't recall how many times I started again because I had a couple smokes and felt like I failed at quitting."

1,"The other thing this helped with is that previously when I quit it felt like I would """"Never"""" smoke again, and I hated the """"forever"""" not being able to do something I enjoy thought. Just take it one day at a time if you break down and smoke just enjoy it and go back to quitting the next day. You didn't fail, you just took a break."""

1,"""so many people are like """"it'd be cool if i didnt smoke it'd save me money and blah blah blah"""" thats not enough to quit. You have to actually want to quit knowing that you are wasting money and damaging your health not that just oh itd be cool if i didnt smoke, thats not enough motivation and THATS why people fail at quitting. You have to want it"""

1,This is it. You have to really want to quit. Not for anyone else but for yourself. I smoked for 13 years. I tried to quit and failed a few times. It wasn't until I was so sick of being sick all the time that I was finally able to kick the habit. I was sick with a bad head cold (I used to get those a lot when i smoked) and then i just stayed in bed for a whole weekend. It sucked and I thought I was going to die but by the time Monday came around I was sure I could keep it up. It's been a year and a half and I haven't smoked once since that weekend. Sure some times I get a craving but I don't really want to start again. I feel so much better now.

1,"""I can second that you have to want it. You are never going to kick the habit until you yourself decide you want to quit."

1,"I tried everything in the book, and what finally made me give it up once and for all was because I was about to spend a large chunk of money on a new car and didn't want to ruin it with cigarette smoke and burns. You sometimes find motivation is some really strange places."""

1,"One day, i realized just how much money I was spending, and just said """"fuck it, I don't want to do this anymore"""".  I seriously wanted to quit.  And, it was fairly easy.  I got on the patch for 2 months, and after that, I've been tobacco free for around 6 years now."""

1,I don’t even smoke but this motivated me to stop smoking

1,"""so true, if you even have questions about whether you want to or not, youll fail. """

1,"""To add to that what helped me was puffing without inhaling. I quit because I wanted to get life insurance and they do a urine test for drugs and cigarettes. No point paying more my whole life for it. Got some test kits to check myself on Amazon and figured after i get the insurance I can start again. Well after 2.5 weeks of mostly cold turkey it became hard to inhale the random cigarette whichout feeling sick. So I would puff but not inhale. Took about 3 months of this random puffing cig game till i no longer even craved one. In fact it now smells bad to me 8/10 times. After 3 months by the way it was flushed out and I was able to take get life insurance for a fraction of the cost. I'll save about $40,000 over the course of the policy."

1,"No point picking it up again now as cravings are gone. Only thing I miss is taking breaks during 14-16 hour work marathon and planning my next steps. Need an hourglass or something."""

1,"""What you say is very true. I would like to add that cravings are temporary. And as you get past a craving, they get shorter with more time between cravings. So each craving you beat makes it just a bit easier. """

1,Never give up. Forgive yourself and try again.

1,"""This is pretty much what I came to say.  I think by far the most important thing, and the thing that stops most people, is number one.  Or at least it was for me.  I smoked for 16 years and tried to quit several times.  Longest I made it was 4 months then I went on a cruise and bam, right back to 1.5 packs a day!  I tried e-cigs but it was really not the same thing.  I enjoyed smoking and even though I thought I ***should*** quit I really didn't want to.  Not really deep down inside."

1,"Finally around 2010 I just got fed up with spending so much money to stink all the damn time and I just quit.  Haven't had a cigarette since.  It wasn't easy.  The cravings were difficult.  It was a really strange time honestly but they only lasted a few months and then I was mostly fine.  I still want a cigarette every now and then but it's more like an impulse, just a thought that pops into my mind, than a physical craving.  I even dream of smoking sometimes lol.  I'm happy that I quite though for sure.  """

1,"Ultimately, I've also came to the conclusion, that self-flagellation doesn't change much at the end of the day."""

1,"""Respectfully, I kinda disagree with the smoking a cig after trying to quit. As a former smoker myself whom also attempted to quit several times, you need to make up your mind. Are you a smoker or not? Then stay strong if you decide it's time that quit. Cold turkey is the only way to truly quit. If you have a cig while trying to quit you've just reset the clock from your last smoke and you'll have to rego the withdrawal all over again. My best advice is to get something to keep you busy. Smoking is not only a chemical dependency but also an physical or oral fixation. I quit with the help of a very big bag of butter rum lifesavers. Decision is yours in the end, are you going to be a smoker or are you going to be a former smoker? """

1,"""Brush your teeth after every meal or cup of coffee. For me, the taste of food or coffee in my mouth would trigger the need for a cigarette."

1,"It's not good for your teeth to brush them too often, but it's worth doing it during the first two weeks."""

1,That honestly sounds like a solid strategy for me. I always long for a cigarette after I've eaten.

1,Chew gum instead

1,"""Not only not good to brush often, but brushing after an acidic drink, particularly coffee, will rub off the enamel which is irreplaceable. *This is only an issue for 30 minutes post your last drink, and using a soft brush head helps with enamel loss."""

1,Brush lightly for only a minute using a soft bristle brush.  No harm done.

1,I used this technique but with mouth wash as it was easier to carry around with me

1,Taste of food in my mouth triggers the need for more food for me lol

1,Can you enlighten me why it’s not good to brush your teeth too often? If it helped someone quit smoking for a year wouldn’t brushing your teeth more often be healthier than smoking?

I did the cold turkey thing too and a stuck for a little bit, but stress got me right back on the wagon (or off? I'm not really sure how the wagon works). I switched to a vape though and its helped my lungs. I keep telling myself that I'll quit but truthfully I'm afraid of what other vice I may pick up to replace it. Good for you though!

Maybe I just haven't smoked for long enough or, 10 smokes a day isn't enough to cause those symptoms in 3 years. """

1,I quit smoking when I was out of town. Not beeing around those places I usually smoked at (and the people I smoked with) really helped since most of the addiction is routine imo.

Some people can quit cold turkey, some can't. I try to make it like a game, and now I smoke 1-2 cigarettes a day, and only at work. That's a level of smoking I can work with until I'm ready to fully jump off. But once you can forgive yourself, it becomes less crippling. """

1,Chantic made me not want to smoke but also turned me batshit crazy

1,"""I took Chantix and read the book recommended above (Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr).

Anyone thinking about using it, make sure you follow the instructions and eat regular meals. At that time I would usually only eat once a day (midday) and my stomach would be killing me around midnight until I ate something.

Skipping the most intense part of it, but I still did *kinda* want to smoke sometimes, though I think that was just the psychological part at that point. But it was much easier to deal with the mental aspect having Chantix take the edge off the physical aspect."

I had planned to buy a rechargeable e-cig and a couple of weeks worth of juice but now I’m optimistic that a week or so on the disposables might be enough to break the habit. """

1,"""In all honesty it is the nicotine dosage you are use to. Vapes/e-cigarettes let you control your dosage and you can decrease it gradually over time. Then when your down to 3mg or less, you start seeing less of a dependence on it. Eventually I just stopped all together within a year. Still vape during the cold months though, vape and coffee in the morning (used to be cig and coffee). Honestly it changed everything. """

1,"""Cigarettes have a ton of chemicals that your body becomes dependent on, quitting nicotine is like quitting coffee, you’re gonna be aggravated and have cravings but it’s manageable. Vape on the other hand is pretty much 4 ingredients, the only addictive one is nicotine, the transition from cigs to vape isn’t as difficult as quitting cold turkey but it’s a different sensation and you still crave the cigs. But if you can switch to vape it’s easier to quit, you can change your dosage down and do it at your own pace and it won’t hurt your health as bad."""

1,"""Yep, I was half pack a day for almost a decade. The trick if you really want vaping to stick is to go heavy dose and a good system for the start. It'll get you hooked harder on the vape for a while, but it's much easier to come down with weaker and weaker doses. Less than 2 years later, I'm still always carrying it around, but it's mixed at a very low 1.5mg nicotine, and I'm basically just working on kicking the routine now. Smoking after eating, during breaks, and while driving were always huge triggers, and that's hard to overcome. """

1,"""Honestly this. I had no interest in quitting for the longest time until my friend started vaping and let me try some of his. Haven't even had the urge to pick up a cig since because the vape gives me the same satisfaction of hand to mouth like you said."

1,Yup. My wife got pregnant and she quit immediately. I vaped for a few months then quit that too.

1,"""Particularly I found it easier to quit by slowly reducing the amount of nicotine in vape juice. After reducing to zero nicotine (over the course of like two years), I slowly stopped craving the action and eventually stopped carrying it around. It’s been over three years since then, and I don’t even get tempted by cigarettes, vapes, or nicotine at all anymore."

1,"Also by working down the amount of nicotine, your body becomes more sensitive to smaller amounts. So when I did try a cigarette after quitting, it was so overwhelming, it made me sick and not want to finish it. """

1,This is how I quit. I was able to gradually reduce the nicotine level of the fluid and also reduce the frequency since I could just take a few hits when the urge came on but not have to smoke an entire cigarette. Eventually I reduced both the nicotine craving and the habit craving enough to be able to quite. Took me about 6 months.

1,"""This. Started this after two years of two packs a week and while it does cost more upfront, you do save money front less frequent trips to buy juices or coils. """

1,"""Same. I just wanted to quit cigarettes, but the nicotine addiction itself isn't such an issue to me. I just use the small pen-like e-cigarettes with a menthol liquid (I don't like all the flavoured stuff) and it doesn't produce much steam or a scent. People sometimes comment that it smells quite nice, if anything."

1,"I might deal with the nicotine addiction itself someday by weaning myself down to weaker liquids. But for now I'm happy with the vaping, I enjoy it and it has completely replaced smoking for me. I couldn't smoke a real cigarette anymore, they smell awful to me now."

1,"I do remember when I made the switch from cigarettes to vaping that there was an immediate change in how I felt. I stopped coughing, I felt more energetic, things tasted better, my fingernails went from blue to a nice healthy pink... whatever vaping is for me, it's a *hell* of a lot healthier than smoking cigarettes and for now, I'm happy with that.

At first you feel silly, and it just doesn’t sit right, because you know you’re lying to yourself. Eventually, it becomes a mantra you say to yourself to get through the next hour, or 15 minutes, or even the next minute if the craving is bad enough, until the craving inevitably passes.

At first you feel silly, and it just doesn’t sit right, because you know you’re basically lying to yourself.

It was kind of like I was beating them right in their own face.  I threw the pack away once I felt like I was over it.  I will be honest in that I have tried to smoke a few times since then but the taste of it makes me nauseous now.

1,-when I was drinking coffee

1,-when I was writing

1,-driving

1,-drinking (that’s the biggest one).

1,So over the course of 2 years (it really took me that long 😭) I broke each of those habits one at a time. I would challenge myself to drive to work without a cig. Then challenge myself to drive home without one (always saying to myself that I could have one later if I want).

1,"Then the next day I would say “well, you didn’t smoke while driving yesterday, so you can probably do it again”"

1,"During that 16yrs I tried so many times to quit but in the end what worked for me (I've been smoke free for years) is NOT changing any single part of my routine. When I had tried to quit in the past, I would stop drinking coffee, not go to bars with friends (drinking/partying made me smoke more), anything that I associated with smoking until I was passed the initial detox stage, but once I started drinking coffee and socializing more etc...it was still an immense trigger to smoke and eventually that is exactly what I'd end up doing, again. So the final time I changed NOTHING, the only thing I did differently was not smoke. It did make it tougher to begin with, but absolutely nothing became a smoke trigger for me. The one other thing I did was a 1/2 of a nicotine gum when I just couldn't take it any more. I was uber careful not to get addicted to them and only chewed when in absolute agony.

Just seeing them and hearing their stories made me know I never wanted to let myself get there. It helped give me the strength to keep away from cigs.

I forced myself to associate smoking cigarettes with feeling like I was going to puke, so it was less enticing to pick the habit back up if I felt any urges. I did this roughly 10 years ago. I've smoked a few times since then when drinking with friends strictly in a social setting and I've never had any desire to pick the habit back up, even the act of smoking while drinking wasn't pleasurable, so it's been years since i've done that as well.

Smoke til your sick of them, and when you have none left, don't buy more. 3 days in you feel like shit. 5 days in it's out of your system, then it's just the habit."

1,"Doesn't matter if you do nothing productive that week. Find a series to binge. Exercise. Find no excuse to go to any shops. Take the money you would have spent on it and save it. Buy food before the weeks starts, find something delicious and healthy to cook. Challenge yourself in the kitchen."

1,"By the end of the week, you don't crave nicotine. You want to go outside for a cigarette. There is a difference. Week 2, go back to work. This is the hard part because you're used to taking smoke breaks, or smoking during your break. You also have access to people who will give you a cigarette."

1,"You can't let them give you one. You've just gone a week without. The habit isn't broken and it's up to you to not go back. Think of the reason why you quit. It's all psychological. You have suffered the withdrawal effects. You have suffered. Don't allow yourself to suffer when you next decide to quit. You deserve to be healthy. You've got this. """

1,"""First you have to actually *want* to quit. If you don't really want to it's going to be nearly impossible. The temptations are always there even after you have been smoke free for years."

1,"Next, you probably have your routine. Do you light up after a meal? When you get in the car? When you first wake up? When you drink? Choose one of your patterns and drop it. I got a new car and so I told myself I wouldn't smoke in it. Eventually I cut out like 5-10 smokes a day since a majority took place on my way to and from places."

1,Then I cut out after meals. Instead I'd brush and floss my teeth so my breath would be fresh. Eventually my brain rewrote the craving to the urge to brush or chew gum.

1,Then I picked up working out. I'd go running or lift weights. That extra energy and motivation from quitting made me feeling better about my body and my health.

1,"I've been smoke free for almost 2 years now. But almost every time I'm out with friends who are still smokers, I still get the urge to bum one. Whenever I do though...I just think how far I've come and what a shame it would be to fall backwards."""

1,"""I’m late to the party but I hope OP sees this. My university had a real tobacco products problem and so they started offering free classes to help people quit (in addition to free gum and patches) and, while it still took me a few attempts to successfully quit smoking and dipping when I ultimately did quit, the stuff I learned in that class was invaluable. It’s simple, but useful."

1,"1) identify your triggers. All smokers have habits for their use like any addict. For most of us they are things like getting in the car to drive, we light up. Finish a meal, we light up. Get done with work, we light up etc. You have to identify your triggers and voice them in your own head (just to say you basically need to admit “I know x is a trigger for me to smoke”) that way it becomes easier not to let that action trigger your habit. You start telling yourself, “I know I’m getting in the car in 15, but I’m not going to let that interfere with NOT smoking today."

1,"2) don’t smoke while using the patch or gum. It’s medically very dangerous for you, but those tools also take some of the burden/responsibility for quitting off of you. You can say “oh man, I’d love to smoke but I put my patch on. Oh well, I don’t even have the choice today."

1,"3) it is an addiction, and some experts argue it is one of the most profoundly addictive substances. Just because you aren’t stealing from people to support your “habit” doesn’t mean that your brain is on your side, it’s not. Your brain is actively trying to get that sweet, sweet, stinky nicotine like Sméagol trying to get his precious back. Help take your brain out of the equation by planning ahead. Address your triggers, set yourself up for success, and you can free yourself from having to internally debate “should I smoke today”. You will start waking up thinking “not today, Satan. Not today...”"

1,"4) accept that you will most likely fail a few times. It can be days between smokes, or it could be years. We don’t really rid ourselves of addiction, we just stop indulging our addictions through hard work and will. Setting yourself up for success is just as important or more than having strong will-power. It’s okay to have setbacks, they’re part of the process. Just recommit to quitting as soon as you can and realize your relapse has no bearing on whether or not you will smoke again today, or tomorrow. Nothing in this process makes you a bad person."

1,"5) Be humble. The only thing worse than smoking is quitting. It’s a fight, quite literally a fight for your life. It’s okay to ask for help. Friends can be a VERY helpful weapon in your arsenal. Tel the people close to you that you really want to quit. Tell your roommates, coworkers, and family. Our addict brains try to create fallbacks and safe spaces so we can always turn back to smoking if we want. The old saying goes “no quarter for prisoners.” Don’t give your addiction a place to live, tell anyone and everyone who will listen that you are finished smoking so they can help hold you accountable. You will feel shame if you tell a coworker you quit, then they catch you smoking two days later. Sometimes we need those motivations, that shame, to get us over that initial hump."

Also, that girl and I got married in April, so I would say things worked out pretty great."""

1,"""For me, before I went cold turkey, I decided I need to break the chain of what I call """"event driven smoking"""".  If you really want to quit, stop the habitual stuff.  A smoke when you get in the car, when you leave the office, on the way to lunch, when you drink beer, after a meal, at a certain break time, etc.  Move your cigarette times around so it's not based on anything, or quit one of those smokey treat times as a start and go from there.

When you've been on the inhaler a few weeks, use the spray. It gives you a great hit, and breaks the hand to mouth movement habit. Once you feel like the replacements are all you need, start chewing the gum, just find a flavour that you enjoy. After a while, you'll hate the smell of tobacco and you'll have minty fresh breath while you get your kick. Eventually, take a piece of normal gum instead of the nicotine gum, and gradually repeat this more frequently to reduce your nicotine levels, then try a day with no nicotine at all, just normal gum. If you can't, don't worry, just have a nicotine gum and try again the next day.

Given the feeling in my chest it was easy to not smoke that day. I woke up Tuesday and didn't think about a cigarette all day. Then on Wednesday I thought about it and realized I should just keep it going because the urge wasn't immense. I'm not smoke free for eight months.

That cut me back over a month or so to 4-5 cigarettes a day.  From there I switched to the lozenges and cut back to eventually nothing.

1,2.) Started dating a non-smoker. Cigarette breaks were limited to times when I wasn’t around her. This significantly reduced triggers.

1,"BONUS) just remembered, had a friend who I told he could take photos of me smoking to post on social media, because for the most part my Facebook was clean of any smoke photos as my grandparents and younger siblings would feel weird seeing that and the pressure of those photos made me uncomfortable."

1,"4.) Girlfriend had a good job, I had food stamps.

I quit” and grabbed the packs I had in my toolbox and gave them to a guy I worked with. Got the strangest look from the guy too lol. I’ve smoked once since then and it has been about 6 years.

1,"Vapes, patches, gums, extend your addiction and after a few weeks/months of your cravings not going away you'll get discouraged and go right back to the pack because you only tried to address the physical side. I use the word BREAK intentionally because that's what you have to do. You need to BREAK the habit, not ease yourself out of it."

1,Educate yourself on the symptoms of withdrawal and the timeline of how they go away and managing them becomes much easier.

1,Tomorrow morning don't have a cigarette. Next time you have an urge... don't have a cigarette. It gives you a headache? Take an advil. Your mood starts fly all over the place? Take a walk.

I read all their advice for quitting and what studies showed in terms of long-term quitting success.

He said that when I told him that, he had literally just opened that pack, smoked that one cigarette and then walked in and threw the rest away.

Also as a smoker your addiction centre converts your body's normal signals for thirst and hunger into compelling you to satisfy the urges to have a cigarette instead.   Water also helps satisfy most of these urges when you quit so that you don't convert all the urges to satisfy with eating snacks which makes most gain weight as a result.

I noticed that most of my urges were habit related - light up while waking to the bus stop, light up on the balcony before going to sleep, light up when you start arranging the books. When I moved to a new city, I quit. Since the environment was new, I was not doing most of the things that I was doing out of habit earlier. There was no walk to the bus stop, no balcony, no bookshelf. Without the triggers, it was easier to resist. Plus, there were so many othee things to do which took my mind off the urge to smoke."

Cravings suck, but they go away. And every time you overcome a craving, the weaker the associations between the craving and the crave-inducing activity (drinking, billiards, band practice, whatever) become. After a couple years, ten years, maybe forever, you will still have cravings, but they will be so infrequent it's actually kind of interesting from a psychological perspective when they present themselves. While unmistakably a cigarette craving, it will feel so unusual at that point that you can easily isolate and ignore it. """

1,"""For me it took a few tries. First a week or 2. Then a month or 2 then I just stopped. I got into the routine having a cigarette at work breaks.

I found both of those methods just made my addiction linger."

1,"the other thing that really helped was a genuine desire to quit but keeping in mind I was going to fail at quitting. it takes the average person 5 attempts to successfully quit smoking, it took me 7 and that’s ok. the important thing to remember if you relapse is it’s not the end of the world and you will be able to try again whenever you are ready. don’t beat yourself up, take your time. you’ll do the thing when you are prepared.

With the patches, they take a while to work, so it's best to put them on at night. That was where I struggled, because I liked showering in the morning and had to switch to night. I chewed the gum with the patches, which you're not supposed to, but it helped with sudden urges. Then, after I quit the patches I chewed the gum for another week or so. Have no desire to smoke again, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind often.

1,"""I don't even smoke, what am I doing here"""

1,"""First off, you have to want to. For me, after about a 20 year relationship with nicotine and approaching my 40th birthday, I was ready to break up with it. A few years back, when my kid was born, I switched to the vape. I was already down to about a cig or two a day at the time so it wasn’t hard. I discovered that I really liked vaping even more so than cigs. That became the next problem...you could do it just about anywhere and with a 30 min work commute, that’s a lot of vaping, and a new habit. Last Jan, my high school buddy and I were turning 40 ten days apart from each other and decided to sever the tie to nicotine together. I’m now 10 month nicotine free and never thought it could do it."

1,So....my advice:

1,1.) Start vaping. You’ll still get nicotine and will learn quickly how nasty the old habit was. Do this as long as you need until you’re ready.

1,"Slowly bring the nicotine levels down at your own pace. When I quit the vape, I was down to 3 milligrams."

1,"2.) when you’re ready to stop spending so much money on vaping, switch to mini lozenges. But the 4 miligram and bite them in half when you pop one. Soon, you’ll be annoyed at how much those cost, too."

1,3.) replace lozenges with tic-tacs

1,"By saving """

1,"""Smoked for 25 years.  My last cigarette was the day I got a good vape kit in the mail.  It worked great.  You just need to follow a few guidelines:"

1,"1.  Get a strong enough juice that you aren't buying cigarettes.  Once you buy the vape setup, do not buy cigarettes anymore.  The juice needs to be strong enough to sate your nicotine craving.  I started with 18mg/ml juice, some people might need to start with 24mg/ml.  Vape as much as it takes to sate your craving without having a cigarette."

1,"2. Have a good vape kit, and a good backup kit (ideally they will be identical so you can share batteries/chargers/coils/wicks).  Buying everything you need at once (2 complete vape kits, juice, replacement coils) might cost you $150 or more, but it pays for itself in a month or less, because you're not buying cigarettes."

1,"3. Have a plan.  Say you're going to start with 18mg/ml juice, you're going to cut your nicotine by a third every month.  So after a month on 18mg/ml, cut it to 12mg/ml juice.  Another month, 8mg/ml, and then maybe go to 3mg/ml and finally go to zero mg/ml.  At each transition, it's ok to vape more, and you'll eventually settle into it after a couple days.  For me, this part was actually really easy."

1,"4. Once you get to zero mg/ml for a couple weeks, you are completely off nicotine.  Keep using the vape, but start occasionally leaving it in the car when you go out and see how it goes.  If you need it, it's there, but you won't."

1,"As far as a starter vape kit, you can check out /r/electronic_cigarette for recommendations.  I have been out of the scene for a couple years, but my recommendation is get a simple kit with a built in battery that you charge just like a cell phone.  Something with a tank that you can easily refill and coils you can easily replace.  Good brand names that I remember are Innokin, SMOK, Aspire, eLeaf, although I am sure there are new brands on the scene."

1,Something like this would be perfect IMO: https://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-Coolfire-Mini-with-Zenith-D22-MTL-p/ink-cfm20.htm

1,"Remember, you'll want TWO of these. The backup kit is super important.  Keep it charged and ready to fill all the time. When you change coils and wash your tank, fill the other one and use that one for a while. That way, if something happens to your main kit: battery dies, it gets stolen, you leave it at the bar, drop it and break the tank, whatever - you aren't forced to go buy a shitty Juul at the gas station or even worse, a pack of cigarettes."

1,"If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.  I got into building my own coils and mixing my own juice, so I can probably answer it."""

Which in turn caused me to gain a little weight because your metabolism slows down after a change like that to your body! You know you're less susceptible to viruses and bacteria if you quit because your lungs, heart, asophagus, etc won't be trying to regenerate themselves from the damage of smoking. I don't even have to mention the long term health effects!"

1,"Lastly, and not really most importantly, think about the social benefits. It seemed to me that it was beginning to be a pain in the ass to be a smoker. Most restaurants and bars don't allow it. Most people don't want smoke in their homes or cars. Most people don't want smoking around their kids or especially babies. Your days of stopping the car to smoke on long trips and standing in the rain to get a quick smoke in are over!"

In fact, it's also caused me to drink less, because drinking doesn't feel as good now without the cigarettes. Now I'll drink alcoholic beverages only in moderation and only if they taste good. Sometimes coffee is a trigger for people. Stop drinking it or switch to another form of caffeine. Sometimes its friends. If it's a friend, you need to spend less time with those friends or ask those friends to not smoke around you and do things with each other that aren't conducive to smoking.

1,"(3) After a month - you're mostly home free - when you walk past somebody smoking now, it doesn't smell good - it seems disgusting.  Advice here - just don't EVER smoke again.  Don't bum a cigarette at a party, don't buy a pack just to have a few.  Just don't!"""

Those first weeks and months are slippery, so it’s really important to stick to your guns during this time."

1,"Chewing gum is good for the cravings, but I think cinnamon gum is more effective.  It has some bite to it that helps take your mind off the need to smoke."

The pills reduced the mental struggle by reducing cravings and anxiety, and the patch removed the physical withdrawal. The withdrawal creates cravings.  He said that the cigarettes, or vaping, give you doses of nicotine, so there is a rush and a withdrawal with every cigarette. The key is to avoid those little withdrawals, by keeping a steady stream of nicotine entering your bloodstream via the patch. This gives your brain a chance to break the behavioral habit side of it before you break the physical dependence side of it.  He said to get the strongest patch and step down.

Carried a water bottle everywhere and drank lots of water. I cleaned the house thoroughly and washed all of the smoke smell out of my clothes. Cleaned the car, too. Threw out all the ashtrays. Stopped taking break outside with smokers. I stopped sitting around, watching television, and instead rode my bike. I hung out with non-smoking friends."

1,Reading Allan Carr's book twice (before intending to quit so I didn't actually follow the advice therein and quit at the end - far too daunting!) and then a year or two down the line when the sub-conscious mind had convinced the conscious mind that quitting now was the only option: using Champix (nicotine receptor inhibitor) as it's known in the UK.

1,* Do it because you really want to.  It's going to be hell so you need to be sure it's what you really want to do.

1,"* Mints, gum, whatever floats your boat but mints helped me immensely."

1,"* My smoking was tied to habits such as eating, driving, and work breaks.  I attempted to find other things to occupy my mind during these times, and also inhaled Altoids like there was no tomorrow."

1,"* Understand that no matter how bad the cravings get, they will go away.  6 years after quitting, I don't even think about cigarettes anymore.  I often forget that I ever smoked in the first place, it's a great feeling."

1,* Keep track of your progress using an app.  I thought it was neat that the app I was using would track my progress and tell me all the benefits of being quit for X amount of days.  It's been 6 years so I don't know if the app is still good but I used QuitNow on Android.  It also keeps track of your stats of how many cigarettes you've not smoked and how much money you've saved.

1,"* Smoking hurts people around you.  I have a friend who is just not ready to quit smoking and it breaks my heart.  I love the guy to death but he's already overweight, eats poorly, and smokes like a chimney.  I've tried everything I can to get him to quit but he just isn't ready (see first bullet point).  My fear is that if he doesn't curb the habit now while he's still got time to fix his health, it's going to be too late."

1,"* Take some deep breaths.  I was extremely irritable in the weeks that followed quitting.  The smallest things would set me off.  Since cigarettes are what I always turned to when feeling stressed or irritated, I had to learn of new ways to cope.  Deep breathing techniques helped to curb a lot of the irritation and stress plaguing me during that time."

1,"""For me, I weaned myself. I was smoking one an hour so the next day, I wouldn’t let myself smoke for an hour and 10 minutes. Next day, an hour and 20 minutes between cigs. Maybe also no smoking in the car. Little things that stretch the time out between cigs without completely depriving me. No exceptions. I did that for about a month and then got the patch. Gum, lollipops, jolly ranchers were helpful with the oral fixation part of it."

1,It's been about a year since I quit smoking entirely and I have no problem being around other smokers at this point but I still avoid the temptation.

1,"My advice would be to get rid of anything that would tempt you or remind you of the pleasure associated with smoking. I got rid of lighters, ashtrays, and accessories. I stopped going to the smoking area on breaks (even though that's where my friend hangout) and made it a rule that smoking in the car was forbidden! (that was easy after I got my new car because I didn't want it to smell bad and it didn't have an ashtray or built in lighter)"

So if I was craving hard I’d look at it to see how long I’d made it which would help me not cave. Also chewing gum is good. And most craving only last about thirty seconds so if you start craving just do something quick to take your mind off it. Also don’t drink to much in the first week or two cause you will mad crave that shit. And after the first week you will find that your cravings have gone down significantly

You will have to come to a point where you will not assuage cravings with an NRT.  You will just have to grit your teeth through withdrawals and starve your body of nicotine until it gives up asking for it."

1,"People who allow themselves to believe that NRTs are going to make quitting painless set themselves up for failure.  After your last patch/lozenge etc., you just have to grind it out; if you continue to substitute - even with substantially lower doses of nicotine - you are going to end up addicted to NRTs or relapse....or both.  Trust me."

1,"So use NRTs as a way to make that final battle less violent and exacting.  Go through the physical purging (hacking up crap, having flu like symptoms) while on the NRTs...sure.  Get yourself to a point where your body is looking for 1-7 mg of nicotine daily as opposed to 21+...sure.  Just know that no matter how much you wean yourself off, that last stage where you say 'no more' will be difficult and there is no resolution but to bear with."

1,"So my plan was to tackle things one at a time. For me, the ritual of holding the smoke between my fingers and taking a drag were pretty strong, so I switched to snus.

1,"""It just sucks, it seriously does. For me I become so aware of my face and there's a ringing in my ears for a week straight.

You just get better and better at handling your emotions and stress levels until it seems to fade away."

1,"As for me, I swapped to a vape a couple of weeks ago and have around 4 cigarettes since then. It saves me money, and I don't stink all the time, but the truth is I don't want to quit yet, probably because I'm still dealing with the shit that lead me to start in the first place."""

1,"Angry ex smoker here, smoked for 20 years, quit for 10 so far."

1,"Get angry at yourself. Put a nicotine patch on and step the nicotine down slowly. Use them for as long as you need to but don't smoke while you have a patch on. I would recommend that you take the patch off at night if you start to have the really vivid dreams they cause. If you are the type of smoker that lights up as soon as they wake up you might want to leave them on 24/7 for a while and just deal with the dreams. (they can get quite intense) I found that Patches worked way better than Chantix which will make you want to kill yourself (its really an anti-depressant, close to Wellbutrin). Don't take drugs that mess with your brain chemistry if you dont HAVE to. You can do this without it, REPLACE the nicotine with patches, and slowly step the dose down. Its science. Breaking an addiction starts with stepping down your doses so you're not going cold turkey and shocking your system. as far as your body knows, its getting what it wants, just not the deadly carcinogens and other nasty stuff that comes with cigarette smoke."

1,"I don't know if its true, but convince yourself that you will die if you smoke with the patch on."

1,"Now for the fun part: Start to notice the smell other smokers. They really stink. As you develop taste and smell again, cigarette smoke will smell FOUL. Convince yourself you never wanna smell like that. Know that you DID smell that way and its unacceptable. Be embarrassed that other people smelled you like that and it was offensive. Notice how stupid people look sucking on those stupid things, freezing their asses off in doorways and outdoor smoking areas. Notice how smokers' car interiors smell and how gross it is. Houses too. Know that YOUR house and car smell that way too. It takes a long time for it to go away too. I wound up selling my car because it reeked, and buying a new one with the money i saved on cigarettes. ($7x2 per day $14x30 days in a month, = $420. that's a NICE car payment!)"

1,Get pissed at them when they crowd the doorways making you run the gauntlet of foul smelling air as you walk into whatever building you're going into.

1,Kissing a gorgeous person that smokes is like licking a very nice looking ashtray. Its still disgusting. Pity them as weak assholes who cant control the simplest things in their life. You're way stronger than them. good luck. dont smoke. Refuse to be a slave to it.

1,"The KEY to your success is convincing yourself that you don't smoke any more. Whenever you get a crave, (and they WILL come, and sometimes its like getting hit with a bat, ride them out. I chewed gum to get the menthol blast i was looking for. My jaw got so strong i could bite through steel cable.) Tell yourself """"Wait, I dont smoke any more"""". let it become your mantra."

1,"At 3 months the cravings will be less and less, then out of NOWHERE you will get hit with them again. Don't let it beat you. At 6 months it happens again, be aware of your brain trying to fool you into justifying 'just one' to see if you're REALLY quit. DON'T SMOKE! Don't give into it. This is normal to be happening, and you should stay the course of not smoking."

1,"Use all that you have learned in the past to get you thru the craves. Dont be a weakling. If you need a break that bad, don't go out and smoke, go to the bathroom instead and just sit in a stall and browse reddit on your phone for 10-15 mins. Whatever it takes. I was able to stand out there in the smoking section with my friends and just not smoke. I don't expect everyone to have that kind of willpower."

1,chewing gum and knowing for a fact that after a week the chemical dependency will be gone. then it's just keeping honest with yourself and not buying a pack

1,"Exercise your willpower, you're gonna make it through, just stay firm and divert yourself with other things. I'm not saying it wasn't hard cause DAMN it was. But I did it and I've got such low willpower that I always impulse buy the candy at the grocery store or the cookies or whatever. If I can do it, so can you!"""

1,I kind of quit cold turkey and then got the urges later on. I just used sunflower seeds and ate food. Kind of an unhealthy habit but I guess it's better than smoking.

It took a few times but finally quit."

1,"Also, sneaking around to hide your smoking from your spouse feels like crap so some motivation from that as well.  """

1,"""Keep trying.  No matter what.  Every day you do not smoke is a victory.  Do not let slip ups get you down.  It took me years of trying after 17 years of smoking, but I have been quit about 8 or 9 years and it is wonderful."""

1,"""I got a prescription for Chantix but I wasn’t optimistic that it would work.  I was a two pack plus a day smoker.  Loved smoking. Loved it. Three days in to the week that you take the pill and continue to smoke, my mother died of lung cancer. She had also been a heavy smoker.

Then I slowly decreased the amount of nicotine in my juice over a period of many months (becoming accustomed to each level before dropping again)."

1,"I managed to get it from 24mg of nicotine, down to 0.5mg. Then I just quit cold turkey after that. And you know what- the next two weeks were STILL hard. But not *nearly* as difficult as going cold turkey from a half a pack a day habit of cigarettes, I can tell you that."""

But after she was born at like a year old I started again bc I was around smokers. Was told I had precancerous cells growing, and needed surgery in a month to remove it. It was successful. But your health is seriously at risk smoking. Do it for you. To be able to breathe,taste, and smell better both with your nose and your clothing."""

1,"""What worked for me was a pill, a drug that my doctor prescribed that I took for about 6 weeks (should have been 12) that made me not wanna smoke. The first few weeks were the hardest with changing habits and all, but I survived."

1,The reason I'm not stating the name of the drug is because I found out later (and I hate the doctor for not telling me beforehand) that the drug has side-effects. One of its side effects is depression/suicidal thoughts.

1,"Now, I don't suffer from depression, but for almost 6 months after stopping to take that drug I had stupid thoughts, mood swings and shit. All in all, that shit is scary and I would not recommend it to anyone. My doctor recommended it to me because she most definitely got a kickback from the company. My insurance didnt even wanna pay for it. Fucked up drug, but it did make me/cause me to quit as I don't know if would have been able to otherwise."""

I quit coldturkey and it was much easier than my earlier attempts at quitting using aids/tricks/sunflower seeds/etc."""

There was definitely some overlap, but now I'm down to the lowest nicotine strength (besides 0) and feel a lot better. The whole 'it saves you money' only applies to the little cheap ones, not the big box mods, which, while much more annoying to others if you're not attentive when using it, are also much more satisfying."""

I then one day just threw away the vaporizer(it being expensive) I said wasn't going to spend the money on another one.

1,"The other thing I realized was that I couldn't cheat. At all. I have not had a single cigarette and do not intend to, ever. I know that even after all this time I could buy a single pack and be right back where I was by the end of it."

1,"The scariest part of the whole thing was the idea of *never smoking again* and the feeling that I was committing to a lifetime of battling cravings. I can tell you this is not the case. By the end of the first year I realized I had already gone sometimes days without thinking about smoking. In the 2-3 years after I sometimes went months without even considering it. And even when I did think about it, it was very vague, weak, easily dismissed. After 5 years I had really no cravings at all - occasionally I'll smell it and feel nostalgic but that's about it."

1,"The only long term effect is the occasional anxiety dream - you know the one where you have a test but forgot to go to class all year? I have dreams where I'm smoking and then realize that I've forgotten that I quit. I think """"dammit, now I have to go through quitting all over again!"""" Not that often, maybe once or twice a year. I also think that's general anxiety (i.e. having that one *instead* of the school dream)."""

All this time, he doesn’t tell anyone... until two weeks have passed. By then, when he tells his family and friends, they’re so happy for him. This encourages him to continue to not pick up another cigarette."

Didn’t matter, my goal was just not to smoke that day. The next day, I did the same thing. By the third day, my partner came home from being away, and I told him I had not smoked for 48 hours and he was proud of me."

1,I quit cold turkey on a drive to visit family when I realized I'd pulled into a rest stop if driven past hundreds of times before just because I wanted a smoke. Realizing I'd altered my habits just for the sake of smoking turned out to be a big turn off to the whole idea. Getting away from the crowd of 'friends' who's originally encouraged me to start smoking helped as well.
