"The hardest thing is on a day that you’re bored. You notice at the most. But if you’re just sitting there playing video games or just sitting there doing work or homework, you start to feel it.  
The more you think about it the more your head starts to hurt.  "
"I used to get places 10 minutes early so I could smoke one or two beforehand, sounds absolutely stupid but my timekeeping is absolutely terrible now, I'm constantly late for stuff
Other than that, quitting cold turkey was easy, I didn't wait to finish a pack - I think I had about 16 cigs left in the pack when I decided I was done, if I'd finished the pack first I would have made excuses to keep smoking. If that made sense"
Not relapsing. Seems like the obvious answer but it's really hard not to relapse when your brain constantly tries to find excuses to smoke.
I just realized that smoking pork was way more delicious. Turkey doesnt hold the flavor from smoking the way that pork does.
Pig meat is always best smoked
I miss my zippo
Wasn't hard at all. My blood pressure was really bad so I didn't have a choice.
"Probably the whole ""not smoking cigarettes"" part"
"I've been a ex-smoker for 4.5 years now. This week got quite bad where I almost started again.
But knowing all the damage I'm doing, especially to my teeth has stopped me. 
They tell you about cancer and lung disease but don't mention that the bone holding your teeth in with start to recead leading to tooth loss. 
So basically, knowing I would lose my teeth stopped me."
affording a juul
People. Other people are much harder to deal with when your brain is constantly seeking out ways to manipulate you into finding excuses to smoke again.
"Missing cigarettes.
Nah but seriously, it’s aside from the sensation it’s just having something to do. It seems like a very different experience walking down the road without a cig than with one. You’re not speaking up, holding anything, flicking ash, bringing your hand up and down to your mouth.
That’s why vapes have been a godsend to me. I don’t even need nicotine, it’s just the sensation of the action I miss."
"There's a couple things most people have trouble with when quitting that make it harder.  First, you have to actually want to quit. I know from experience that many times I tried to quit I didn't want to quit, I was trying to quit because everyone was telling me to. Second, just because you stumble doesn't erase your progress. Smoking a cigarette after a couple days doesn't mean you've failed, we're fallible. Don't throw your hands up and give up because you fell to temptation. Continue trying. Addiction is a beast, but we're animals that thrive in adversity. "
"Someone I work with is trying to switch to a healthier lifestyle, had been trying for a long time before she realized that slipping up once doesn't erase all the progress you've made. Same thing I had to learn when I tried to go a year without drinking. And this is probably the best advice for trying to overcome anything."
"The part about slipping up is the real key.  My wife and I quit 4 or 5 years ago I really can't remember exactly when.
 We both went cold turkey. We do still pick up a pack of smokes if we are going out to drink and know we will be drunk.  A night out heavily drinking which we only do once a month or every other month we might split a quarter pack and then just give the pack to one of our smoker friends when we leave.    
People always give us shit about killing our progress but whatever.  It works for us and certainly beats a pack a day each."
"My biggest problem is that I want to quit, but I want to smoke.
I LOVE smoking.  Reason: It makes me feel good.  I hate smoking, it tastes terrible, it makes me cough, it costs so much money, I am often smoking alone, outside in the cold nowdays.  It fucking sucks.  But it makes me feel good.  It's so relaxing.  A few hours without a cigarette is painful.  
Addiction is more than a beast, it's a fucking monster.  It warps your brain into loving the feeling of being gross.
I know it's gross, I know it's slowly killing me, I know it stinks, I know it costs me a lot of money...but my brain doesn't care.
The way I see it: My body tortures me when I deprive it of nicotine.  So I smoke to feel normal, not because I want to feel the relaxing effect, but because that relaxing effect, is what normal used to be.
I want to quit, but the hold it has on my body is greater because smoking makes me feel good."
"Any tips for making yourself actually want to quit? I know I need to, I just don't want to. I've even considered hypnosis. "
"> you have to actually want to quit
Yeah, this. Quitting is easy. Wanting to quit is hard. I've quit like 5 or 6 times (defined as no smoking for a week+), but I always kinda *want* to smoke.
"
"So I just fell into this, accidentally quitting smoking because of a cracked rib.  I think about a certain look on peoples' faces at AA meetings, the ones that said, ""I'm only doing this bullshit because I have to do this bullshit.""  It's the same thing.  
However, I've managed to stick with it because this isn't the first time I've quit, and something I noticed the last time I quit (for about three years) seems pretty important.  
That feeling you get when you want to smoke a cigarette after you've quit smoking?  That twitchy, ancey, can't scratch that itch feeling?  It's the exact same feeling you get just before you light up a cigarette.  In other words, you actually experience that addict's separation MORE AS A SMOKER than you do as one who has quit.  After a couple of weeks the urges hit me only a few times a day instead of twenty, when I was actually smoking.  
It's still bullshit, though.  I didn't want to quit and every single day I can think of good reasons to go back and enjoy myself.  I think if I can stick with it another month or so I'll be fine.  But I might say, ""fuck it,"" too, because I don't really want to quit.  I'm only doing it because the opportunity arose and my conscience demands that I try it.  I need a fucking blow job.  
"
Yup. Smoked about a pack in total in the 3 months after I quit. But haven't smoked in 4 years now.
I second this completely. You have to want to. Like properly have to. No pretending to yourself. I smoked for 10ish years and knew I wanted to stop by the time I turned 30. I wanted to stop. It's almost a state of mind 
"The first one is very true. I just don’t have the motivation within myself to want to quit.
Besides the health risks (which feel so far away from me now since I’m only in my 20’s), I don’t personally see why I should quit..."
"This advice is on point. I successfully quit cold turkey on the first try. Everyone asks me what my secret was and simply put, I allowed myself to cheat. If I was feeling really stressed or having a bad craving, I'd allow myself to have a cigarette. Eventually, I got to the point where I didn't get those cravings anymore."
"I feel like there's a certain level of shame you have to hit before you can really commit to it. I was never a big smoker, but spent a long time as a can-per-day chewer. What compelled me to quit was something my 2 pack-per-day neighbor said to me. We were out on our porches, he was smoking and I was chewing. He told me, ""seems like every time I see you there's something in your lip"". Holy shit that hit me hard. My chain smoking neighbor notices my tobacco habit? It must be bad. I was able to quit within a couple weeks of then and it's been almost 3 years now."
"Yes, and education re effects was helpful to me."
"“ you have to want to quit” this is good for people to note.  
At the doctors office when the nurse confirms some stuff they ask about smoking. I usually lie because before theyd just say “ you should stop it’s bad for you”.
Last time I didn’t lie and I was surprised when she said “ when you’re ready to quit we can help”
Powerful stuff. "
Great advices
"> First, you have to actually want to quit.
My mother successfully quit after smoking for 30+ years and said this exact thing. She said the times she had tried in the past, she didn't really want to."
"Absolutely this. I can't recall how many times I started again because I had a couple smokes and felt like I failed at quitting. 
The other thing this helped with is that previously when I quit it felt like I would ""Never"" smoke again, and I hated the ""forever"" not being able to do something I enjoy thought. Just take it one day at a time if you break down and smoke just enjoy it and go back to quitting the next day. You didn't fail, you just took a break."
"so many people are like ""it'd be cool if i didnt smoke it'd save me money and blah blah blah"" thats not enough to quit. You have to actually want to quit knowing that you are wasting money and damaging your health not that just oh itd be cool if i didnt smoke, thats not enough motivation and THATS why people fail at quitting. You have to want it"
This is it. You have to really want to quit. Not for anyone else but for yourself. I smoked for 13 years. I tried to quit and failed a few times. It wasn't until I was so sick of being sick all the time that I was finally able to kick the habit. I was sick with a bad head cold (I used to get those a lot when i smoked) and then i just stayed in bed for a whole weekend. It sucked and I thought I was going to die but by the time Monday came around I was sure I could keep it up. It's been a year and a half and I haven't smoked once since that weekend. Sure some times I get a craving but I don't really want to start again. I feel so much better now. 
"I can second that you have to want it. You are never going to kick the habit until you yourself decide you want to quit.
I tried everything in the book, and what finally made me give it up once and for all was because I was about to spend a large chunk of money on a new car and didn't want to ruin it with cigarette smoke and burns. You sometimes find motivation is some really strange places."
"> First, you have to actually want to quit.
This
I can't stress this one enough.  Seriously, this is your biggest stumbling block.  You have to want it.  Seriously want it.
I tried quitting many times, for my health, for my girlfriend,  for convience...no matter what reason i had, no matter what plan I had, whether cold turkey, gum, the patch, whatever...it always ended up in failure.
One day, i realized just how much money I was spending, and just said ""fuck it, I don't want to do this anymore"".  I seriously wanted to quit.  And, it was fairly easy.  I got on the patch for 2 months, and after that, I've been tobacco free for around 6 years now."
I don’t even smoke but this motivated me to stop smoking 
"so true, if you even have questions about whether you want to or not, youll fail. "
"To add to that what helped me was puffing without inhaling. I quit because I wanted to get life insurance and they do a urine test for drugs and cigarettes. No point paying more my whole life for it. Got some test kits to check myself on Amazon and figured after i get the insurance I can start again. Well after 2.5 weeks of mostly cold turkey it became hard to inhale the random cigarette whichout feeling sick. So I would puff but not inhale. Took about 3 months of this random puffing cig game till i no longer even craved one. In fact it now smells bad to me 8/10 times. After 3 months by the way it was flushed out and I was able to take get life insurance for a fraction of the cost. I'll save about $40,000 over the course of the policy.
No point picking it up again now as cravings are gone. Only thing I miss is taking breaks during 14-16 hour work marathon and planning my next steps. Need an hourglass or something."
"What you say is very true. I would like to add that cravings are temporary. And as you get past a craving, they get shorter with more time between cravings. So each craving you beat makes it just a bit easier. "
Never give up. Forgive yourself and try again. 
"This is pretty much what I came to say.  I think by far the most important thing, and the thing that stops most people, is number one.  Or at least it was for me.  I smoked for 16 years and tried to quit several times.  Longest I made it was 4 months then I went on a cruise and bam, right back to 1.5 packs a day!  I tried e-cigs but it was really not the same thing.  I enjoyed smoking and even though I thought I ***should*** quit I really didn't want to.  Not really deep down inside.  
Finally around 2010 I just got fed up with spending so much money to stink all the damn time and I just quit.  Haven't had a cigarette since.  It wasn't easy.  The cravings were difficult.  It was a really strange time honestly but they only lasted a few months and then I was mostly fine.  I still want a cigarette every now and then but it's more like an impulse, just a thought that pops into my mind, than a physical craving.  I even dream of smoking sometimes lol.  I'm happy that I quite though for sure.  "
"So, how do you know when you want to quit and when someone else is influencing you to quit?"
"> Smoking a cigarette after a couple days doesn't mean you've failed, we're fallible.
Ultimately, I've also came to the conclusion, that self-flagellation doesn't change much at the end of the day."
"Respectfully, I kinda disagree with the smoking a cig after trying to quit. As a former smoker myself whom also attempted to quit several times, you need to make up your mind. Are you a smoker or not? Then stay strong if you decide it's time that quit. Cold turkey is the only way to truly quit. If you have a cig while trying to quit you've just reset the clock from your last smoke and you'll have to rego the withdrawal all over again. My best advice is to get something to keep you busy. Smoking is not only a chemical dependency but also an physical or oral fixation. I quit with the help of a very big bag of butter rum lifesavers. Decision is yours in the end, are you going to be a smoker or are you going to be a former smoker? "
"Brush your teeth after every meal or cup of coffee. For me, the taste of food or coffee in my mouth would trigger the need for a cigarette.
It's not good for your teeth to brush them too often, but it's worth doing it during the first two weeks."
That honestly sounds like a solid strategy for me. I always long for a cigarette after I've eaten.
Chew gum instead
"Not only not good to brush often, but brushing after an acidic drink, particularly coffee, will rub off the enamel which is irreplaceable. *This is only an issue for 30 minutes post your last drink, and using a soft brush head helps with enamel loss."
I’m pretty sure smoking is worse for your teeth than brushing too often. 
Brush lightly for only a minute using a soft bristle brush.  No harm done.
I used this technique but with mouth wash as it was easier to carry around with me
Taste of food in my mouth triggers the need for more food for me lol
Can you enlighten me why it’s not good to brush your teeth too often? If it helped someone quit smoking for a year wouldn’t brushing your teeth more often be healthier than smoking?
"So this might work great for a couple days, and then when your out with your friends having a few drinks or you're late coming home from work and grab a snack at the train station suddenly you get the nicotine shivers and bam you're back to smoking ...."
"Oooo, that's a good catch. Coffee still imprinted with cigarettes for me."
You could just brush your tongue instead.
"As a guy quitting smoking weed, thank you for actual helpful advice that I haven’t heard anywhere yet. After dinner is the biggest struggle. "
Exercise and sunflower seeds did it for me.  Smoke free since 2009
So do you grind them up before you smoke them or what? 
Fox Mulder? Is that you? 
+1 for Sunflower seeds.  I did that as well.  Started the exercise bit later.  4+ yrs now.
"Congratulations, I use to smoke quite often but now i've dialed it down a decent amount although how do you escape the constant lure and pull especially when mates are smoking around you? "
Sunflower seeds are as addictive as hell.
How do you exercise. I'm guessing you skulk around at night with a revolver hunting lizards.
Semechki?
Mr Sir? is that you?
"+1 for me. Especially when driving. 
Lower the window spit seeds out... I used to drive 4-6 hours for my job constantly. This is how I finally quit. 
I uses snus /Gum/etc at first to wean off nicotine.. but seeds were my long term habitual helper I could have anywhere. 
The only thing that trapped me for awhile was social events and social anxiety. A smoke used to be my escape when my anxiety raised. I realized that I could just say I needed to make a call or needed some air... but it took time. "
I am currently unable to quit. I just wanted to say congratulations and good advice :) 
Mr. Sir? 
"This guy read ""holes"" and took it to heart."
There is an emergency bag of seeds in my glove compartment at all times. 
Exactly what I did.  Going on a month strong.
"Well, well, well....if it isn’t the Reddit user with half my power"
Same Exact program for me. Lots of running.
"I also used sunflower seeds, i still occassionally blow through a bag"
"For real, exercise would give me a headrush on par or at least close to a cigarette. "
Juul
sun flower seeds i remember eatting those seeds as a kid. eat too many and your lips will be dried ass hell. proarably all the salt they put on the seeds. 
Congrats dude! Unrelated but I’ve been vomit free since 93.
A pack of sunflower seeds a day. Keep that mouth busy 
Joe scott is that you?
this dude in one of my classes is always chewing sunflower seeds. professor always makes fun of him
"Former dip user here. Sunflower seeds and gum did it for me as well. 
I still tuck chewing gum under my bottom lip."
"I too quit doing the same thing.  The only time I didn't feel like a cig was after a big workout, so I worked out all of the time.  The seeds just help pass the time."
"\+1 for sunflower seeds. Keeps your mouth fixated, and becomes a new addiction that is much easier to quit. "
Sunflower seed effectiveness +30% if you're a slav.
6 years earlier and you could’ve made it rhyme. Congrats regardless
"Same here, but youve got me by a year."
"sunflower seeds are a great help! I also started collecting these crazy sideshow collectible statues with some of the money I saved, to visualize how much I was actually spending. Now I have a pretty stellar collection. "
You meant sunflower weed?? 
My child asked me to stop because he was genuinely worried for my health. That look on his face as he begged me was l I needed. I went cold turkey and haven’t slipped up in four years this month. 
"couldnt sleep when i was a kid. came down crying to my dear fat her begging him to stop for so many nights. he looked me in the eyes and promised he would stop eventually. 20 years later, he hasnt stopped and now i stopped caring."
"My sisters and I tried doing that with our mom about her cigarettes and her drinking, she just got mad and left probably to go smoke the stress away. "
"I asked my mom to stop smoking about 35 years ago now. And she did.
Kudos to you!!"
"Yeah, I had to have a conversation with my son because his (slightly older) cousin had told him smoking is really bad and kills you, and he was really upset, not wanting to believe her.
As much as you might justify continuing smoking to yourself, trying to put that justification into words whilst explaining the harm it does just doesn't work, and serves as a kick up the arse.
Not nearly as far down the line as you though, I'm about 6 months in, vaping only (although I started, indavertantly, with a massive drop in nicotine so had some heavy withdrawls) "
I tried this so many times with my parents but their addiction just wouldn’t let them stop. My dad died from a smoking-related condition and my mum just puffs on in full denial. 
I stopped because I found out I was pregnant. Giving up coffee was harder than cigarettes just thinking of what one could do to my unborn child. I recently had her and have had zero desire to smoke one. 
"I read somewhere that cold turkey is really the only effective way. Personally, I've tried tapering off and it didn't work for me at all because the cigarettes are still always there and I just couldn't stop myself from teaching for one, although it did help me cut back a bit. I did the cold turkey thing too and a stuck for a little bit, but stress got me right back on the wagon (or off? I'm not really sure how the wagon works). I switched to a vape though and its helped my lungs. I keep telling myself that I'll quit but truthfully I'm afraid of what other vice I may pick up to replace it. Good for you though! It's not an easy thing to do. "
Same thing for me except it was my now wife. She cried about me possibly dying early and having to live on without me. Really tore me up. 2 years cig free
Kids are a great motivation to stop smoking. My brother stopped daily smoking when he got his new girlfriend because she hated it. He would still smoke a lot at parties and some here and there. Hasn't smoked since my niece was born.
"I've lost a lot of family members to cancer, particularly lung cancer, it's a terrible way to go and as everyone is standing around them dying, it's gut-wrenching to see the look of blame on their face, knowing it was their fault for smoking. I'm currently 6-8 months without one, vaping helped me quit easily avoiding and not going to bars/drinking.  As much as everyone talks shit about the Jul vape, it literally helped me quit smoking so easily and then it's just a matter of not vaping, which is a hell of a lot easier than not smoking imo."
"My dad chewed tobacco for more than 25 years. All it took for him to quit was my little brother asking him to stop. My little brother was younger than 10 years old and my older brother, sister and myself never asked him to stop. "
I've been asking my mom to stop since I was 6. I'm almost 20 now. Still waiting. :(
"This is exactly what happened to me. 
6 year olds can be brutally honest. "
My mom never stopped telling me how I was a selfish little bitch for wanting to take smoking away from her. 
Wish my dad would listen...I've begged so many times 
When I got asthma and was sent to the hospital when I was 4 my mom quit cold turkey for me. My dad’s asthma apparently wasn’t the deal breaker. Forever grateful. 
"i quit when my first was born, he's 5 now. It sucks at first obviously but now I find it really offensive when I smell. Ive tried one here and there and cant even finish it. 
There's no tricks, just stop and accept the fact that it going to suck. "
"Lol, I tried this for 30 years with my mom, she still smokes. "
As a child I used to break my father cigarettes. He would leave (and return) with a fresh pack. Thanks to my studies in the 3rd grade I knew that cigarettes were awful for you.  I would break roughly 7-10 of them. I felt bad breaking them because I ended up costing him money but at the same time I didn't want him smoking. 
But that would mean I would have to have a child... And start Smoking...
"My daughter (6) put up post it notes ""Stop Smoking! Go talk to your doctor!""  Currently on Chantix and doing pretty well."
That's how me and my sister got my mom to stop smoking. When we were little we were scared she would die because of what we learned about smoking in school. 
I started doing that to my parents as soon as I could form sentences. They never quit. Dad died at 59 and mom at 62. Dad didn't last till my college graduation and neither of them made it to my wedding. Tell your kid he's lucky!
"I got my Aunt to stop smoking when I was younger because I said she stunk when I went to sit on her lap (oh, child honesty). She quit that day.
Apparently I said the same thing to my uncle too. He didn't care as much, still smokes."
"I remember learning about tobacco and alcohol in elementary school. 3rd grade or so. I came home absolutely freaking out because my parents smoked cigarettes IN THE HOUSE, directly next to me and my little brother all the time since we were born. My dad also always had a beer in his hand. 
They basically told me to shut up and get over it. That adults can do what they want. We continued that unit and school and that whole week I remember being an absolute wreck and fearing for their lives haha. I remember an instance where I raised my hand in class and told the teacher that I asked my parents to stop and told him and the what they said. The teacher really didn’t say anything and no one played with me at recess that day because “my parents are gross”. 
You’re a good dad. Thank you for doing this for your kiddo "
Hey congrats! 
"My dad quit for years and has been caught multiple times (by myself, my mom, and my sister) and even after watching us sob and beg him to quit, he's still doing it. We don't know what to do to get him to stop.
His smoking put him in the hospital recently and the doctors are honestly surprised he hasn't died yet."
You are stronger than my mother. Both her kids did that at separate times and she still smokes.
My dad told me to stop being a bitch
i cried and cried and cried when i found out my dad smoked. he took his last cigarette out of the  box and wrote the date on it as a promise he would stop. that little fucker didn’t. 
Hijacking top comment to give /r/stop smoking a shoutout
So have a kid? Is that the tip?
"When my twin and I were 3 and my older brother was 6, we asked our parents to stop because we didn't like it.  They did.  Amazing.
Mom had smoked a pack of normal cigarettes a day and dad smoked two packs of unfiltered Camels a day.
I *think* I remember my older brother orchestrating the whole thing, but I'm super glad he did."
Good for fucking you. Seriously. You must be a great parent.
My mother has said that she wants to stop but I’ve never actually seen her do it. I do think that me developing asthma do to it was a wake up call to her however.
The love of my life asked me to quit so that we could spend more time together. 
"My 4 year old told me he thought my smokes were so cool (fire and all) and he couldn't wait until he got big just so he could smoke.
I threw them away then and there. I have had a few since but never gave up due to a slip up on my end."
"Fuck man this one hit hard. I haven’t thought of this in years. I remember making a poster for my mom asking her to quit. My brother told me it would make her sad so I never showed her and never asked her to quit. She wilted away, fell to the rot of cancer then remission for one day. One day. One day of remission. One day free from oncoming death. On the way to eat at a Mexican joint that’s no longer there. Mom is talking oddly. We sit down. With out a moment the fumbling of crying scared and running 8 year old boy pleading for a doctor a brother in shock and a father crying and doing his best to help my mother. A Grand mal seizure that would end up boiling her mind to nothing. The cancer had spread to her brain. She died that day. Not her body that would take time. But her, mom she died. One day. We never heard her voice again not a word. Too Ra loo Ra loo that sweet song I sing to my son is the only memory I have of her voice. Did she even know? We knew.  What if? What if I had showed her my poster? "
"> cold turkey
Good for you, I went cold turkey 10 years ago.  I've always felt that anything else is just substituting one habit for another.
"
"It's a mental game. You have to want to quit. By the end of my time as a smoker, I hated it. The way I smelled, hacking in the middle of the night, winded going up stairs, doctor's appointments were shameful. I got fed up and just stopped one day. Stopping isn't hard, sustaining is. Every time I thought about smoking, I thought about how disappointing it would be to go back to day 0. Smoke free since January 2015."
"I think this is exactly it. You can use tools to help, but if you don't actually want to quit, you aren't going to quit. Any time someone says ""I am going to try to quit"", I already know they will fail. If they really wanted to quit, ""try"" wouldn't even be in that sentence. 
I agree with your second part too. One drag puts you back at 0, the idea of that definitely helps you stay smoke free. "
"How long into the ""quitting"" do you notice that it's getting easier?"
"How many a day did you smoke? I've been smoking for 3 years, now and I only really have a bit of a smoker's cough. Don't wake up hacking, don't get winded going up stairs though, I do a lot of labour for work so, that might help keep my lung capacity better. Maybe I just haven't smoked for long enough or, 10 smokes a day isn't enough to cause those symptoms in 3 years. "
I quit smoking when I was out of town. Not beeing around those places I usually smoked at (and the people I smoked with) really helped since most of the addiction is routine imo.
It definitely is routine. Part of my routine used to be starting the day off with a cup of coffee and cigarette. So I stopped drinking coffee and stopped smoking cigarettes! Now I drink tea for my caffeine 😬
"I did one better. I actually quit right before moving. And then all my friends knew me as a nonsmoker, so nobody was ever asking me to go out and smoke with them.
Quit right before grad school, which sounds totally counterintuitive, but I was ready for the change. Sounded better than quitting DURING school, and since I didn't want to go over 10 years as a smoker, quitting before sounded better. "
That’s exactly what my wife did three years ago! We went to the nose of Iowa and hiked. She had her last cigarette when we got there and never turned back.
Quitting smoking is not that hard. I’ve done it five times this year alone
"Reminds me of the last time I've smoked a long time ago, damn it feels like an eternity since this morning."
"That's part of it for me: Set realistic goals. Nothing is more depressing than failing yourself over and over again. Nothing makes you need a smoke more than after you've failed to quit. Some people can quit cold turkey, some can't. I try to make it like a game, and now I smoke 1-2 cigarettes a day, and only at work. That's a level of smoking I can work with until I'm ready to fully jump off. But once you can forgive yourself, it becomes less crippling. "
Exactly. I quit about 30 minutes ago and will probably quit again later on today. 
I quit this morning and then again about 8 minutes ago. Feel like I’ve got a few more in me today before I quit again tomorrow 
I've quit every Monday for the last four months.  Those Friday night drinks get me every weekend.  
You just need to quit smoking one more time than you quit quitting. 
Mark Twain paraphrased 
"Give this mans gold
"
I used to quit 20 times per pack!
Calm down Hedberg
r/marktwain
It doesn't seem that easy if you had to start again 4 times
Lmao!
"Pffff amateur, already did it 7x19 times this week."
I quit every weekend.
"Stopping entirely just means quitting enough times that you spend more time smoke free than not. Not everyone quits cold turkey, and if you quit 5 times this year and 7 next year, you'll have made progress.
Someone can quit 18 times a year, and that doesn't make them a failure, it just means they haven't hit the attempt that'll be successful yet. The more you try, the more chances you have to succeed."
Pretty sure you’re still smoking. 
Those are rookie numbers... I've quit at least 15 times today alone. 
I can quit anytime I want... I just dont want to
"This is funny but was also the key for me to actually quit.  I just kept on quitting until it stuck.  I tried every nicotine replacement product known to man, as well as cold turkey but wasn't successful, until what felt like my 100th attempt."
"I probably quit 14 times ""I'm done I'm never going to have another fucking cigarette again!"" before I finally quit for good. "
"Are you mi dad?
Because he says exactly that. He's quit smoking permanently and forever six times. "

How long did you smoke for?
"Yup, this. Made it really easy. Tobacco free since 2009"
"Dont quit. Seriously. Start **not**  smoking. That way each day is an achievement, not a sacrifice. You focus on what you gain, not what you gave up. "
I smoked for 8 years and used chewing tobacco for 6 and this is the best advice here. Chewing gum and weening off won’t help if you can’t do this. I was in the best shape of my life when I smoked but I feel a hell of a lot better now that I’ve started to not smoke.  I haven’t touched a cigarette or dip in 4 years and I’ll never go back. I’ve even started to smoke cigars every now and then without a problem of quitting or anything. It is 100% a mental state.
Smoke-free for 2 days now. I really like this way of looking at it. Thanks.
"You have to fucking endure it and realise that by quitting you are quite literally saving your own life. This shit will kill you and it will hurt the entire time you're dying. You need to just fucking stick with it, replace the cravings and endure that shit like you're playing a game of dark souls. Only you have to win, because if you fuck up, you'll die. "
"Enduring is the key, people will always be looking for the magical solution but it's really just down to how long you can not use mental gymnastics to justify smoking again. 
It has to be hard to be worth it and if you're not struggling like a fish out of water then it's not working. (imo) "
"The thing, enduring is hard. So fucking hard. I quit smoking for four years. I thought the urge would fade away. It did not.
Every day, for four years, I wanted to smoke. I'm back on a pack a day right now. I now quitting would be what's best for me, but I don't want to feel that need everyday again."
"This is the only real advice, go about it however you need to, but you’re literally saving your own life. It’s not a matter of if, but when."
"Amen brother, amen."
"Watching my wife’s grandpa die from lung cancer got me to quit. My wife was pregnant with our first kid so she had already quit. 
Any time I would have any cravings for a smoke I would think how he didn’t get to meet my daughter and if not smoking allows me to see my great grandchildren, then I can live without the cigarettes. "
"This blows my mind. I literally quit with Dark Souls 2. Proof [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/32vurf/a_story_and_a_showing_of_thanks/). Followup proof [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/495zw1/dark_souls_2_and_quitting_smoking/). I almost caved a week ago, but, praise the sun I'm still over three and a half years strong."
How many people am I allowed to kill while I detox?
My heart attack and subsequent bypass surgery aged 42 helped me quit.
"My wife had a heart attack and died two weeks later. She was in a coma the whole time.
I quit the day after she got taken into the ICU. I've promised our kids I'd never smoke again.
Eight months and counting."

Dude... How are you now?
"The ebook by Aaron Carr that is pushed hard by /r/stopsmoking cost less than cigarettes and helped me quit ""cold turkey"" and within hours...I didn't even finish the book but quit completely in 2013
Edit- Allen Carr is the author's name...the book's title is The Easy Way to Quit Smoking"
[deleted]
[deleted]
"> Alan Carr
Can I get a tl;dr on his book/method and why is seems to be so effective? "
I see this a lot. What's in this book that's so fucking magical?
"So much this. Smoked for 15 years, more than a pack a day and stopped over night just over 4 years ago. 
Won't recommend to any ex-smoker, but that book even enabled me to be a ""party smoker"" - I can smoke half a pack on a metal gig getting drunk, and have no desire to smoke again the next day. I do this about once every 2-3 months and am amazed I never fall back...  YMMV"
"That book that is so good at getting you to quit, you can't even finish reading it."
"The Easy Way to Stop Smoking is actually the name of the book.  It is fantastic and worked for me too.  It puts you in the proper mindset.  Quitting gives the connotation that you are sacrificing something good when clearly you are not, a key point in the book!"
"This book was great for me, I recommend it to anybody who wants to quit."
"Quit smoking a few months ago thanks to The Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Smoked for nearly 10 years, always wanted to quit but never succeeded until I read the book. Do it."
"Same here, but the video.
Edit: sorry mates, I have no link for the video. It’s probably been 6 years since I’ve seen it.  Tried looking for it on YT but I couldn’t see it."
"I've heard this from so many people. They read the book in one sitting and never lit another cigarette. I wish there was a book that would do the same for procrastination, overeating, anxiety..."
Is it Allen or Aaron? Can’t seem to find Aaron Carr. 
"Thank you for this. I just ordered a used copy on eBay. This will be attempt number 3 for me. My grandmother quit when she was in her 40's and my mother who is 57 just quit because of bronchitis and hasn't smoked in almost a month. I've seen the effects of long term smoking and I don't want that, plus I have a 3 year old daughter and my girlfriend has daughter's as well. I'm going to try this book, and anything else I can find to stop, permanently."
"I read this book to and I feel it helped me quit. I read it a couple of more times whenever I started smoking again, and I really think it helped to quit, but I never felt disheartened because I'd stated again. I knew quitting again would be a choir but I still had that book. "
Same here! 
"So, I read that book in an attempt to find some angle of attack to get my dad to quit, but the book just basically says to think of yourself as a nonsmoker and just do nonsmoker things.  Other than that, it's just a motivational book with stories about the author who quit smoking and why his life is better without it.
Am I missing the point because I've never smoked and therefore never understood the addiction?"
worked for me too - smokefree since 2011
"Yup, that story he tells about making a boat turn back because he forgot his smokes but then not smoking any out of shame really hit me. "
"I have to add my voice to the choir recommending this book. It really works. It manages it take away almost every excuse you can think of to keep yourself smoking.
Years ago I decided to quit. I'd gone several days without smoking nearly at all but I kept having a late night smoke that ""didn't count if I didn't inhale"". After a few days of feeling like a failure I googled a bit and bought the ebook that night. It was the first night I went without smoking which turned into the first full day, and so on and so forth. I kept reading until my understanding of the addiction shifted to the point that I truly knew that I never wanted or needed to smoke again. I don't even think I finished the book either. 
I bought a hard copy soon thereafter because I wanted to pass this along. My husband quit shortly after me using a combo of the book and the patch. We then gave the book to my parents. with the acknowledgement that we didn't expect them to quit. That it had to be on their terms. But if they ever thought they were ready, to read the book in case it could help them too. 
Within the next year my mom and dad had both quit. They were lifelong smokers with 40+ years of experience who had tried quitting many times before and this book managed to help them where so many other methods failed. 
It's been 7 years now and I think my mom is still alive solely because she quit. That book saved her life. Now my mom still says she quit just so she could stop reading the damn book. I don't care. I'm just glad she's here to do the complaining."
"This needs to be up at the top. This is a proven method which is not only piss easy, it does not require any gimmicks. No chewing gum endlessly, sunflower seeds, no need for nicotine replacement therapy etc. I understand people being sceptical, I am the biggest sceptic out there but after reading this book, it changed my life forever. I won't lie to you, I have smoked after reading the book and quitting. The trigger for this was alcohol which you should steer clear from for the first few months ideally but nonetheless thanks to the book when the inevitable cravings do come I don't give in and buy a pack, I understand them for what they are and ignore them, happy to be a non smoker. That's the power of this book, cannot recommend enough"
What is it about the book that can cause so many to stop smoking? Is it a nicotine-laced book?
Read the book but for some reason it was the audiobook that made me really quit. It’s on audible.
"I recommend this to every one that is trying to quit or mentions wanting to.  It'll be a year  for me in a few weeks.  
It works amazingly well, only stipulation is you have to go into it already wanting to quit.  Someone suggested it to me many years ago and I only read it out of curiosity.  It motivated me to give it a shot but just didn't give enough effort.  The important thing though was it planted the seed.  I knew that when I was really ready to quit I'd go back to the book.  Sure enough when the time came that I made up my mind and that was it; went back, read it again, and never looked back.  Cold turkey"
"When you decide you’re going to buy your last pack, find a mason jar to put all those cigarette butts out in. Then when your pack is empty and the jar is full of cigarette butts and ash, fill it with water just enough so they’re all submerged. 
Anytime you want a cigarette, take that jar and shake it to get it all mixed up then open it and take a deep ass whiff.
You’ll quit in no time. "
"If you still have cravings after taking the big whiff, then take a little sip also."
Well that's thinking outside the box lol. I like it.
"Eh, that's pretty much what my whole apartment smelled like. Glad it worked for you though."
"Honestly - Cold Turkey. Bite the bullet, suffer for the week and you will be good.  
I quit almost 3 months ago, had last cig Sunday night, threw papers and filter in the bin and that was it. It was hard, fucking hard but get past 3 - 4 days and you will be good"
"This is what I did, over 5 years ago now. I wanted to stop because I'd just had a cold with a very sore throat and smoking was hell and made me feel worse. I'd recently read that the worst bit was the first 3 - 4 days and I felt I could power through that.
Not only did I manage to power through those few days (it was 4 for me) but afterwards it got so much easier. At that point it was more about breaking the habit rather than the pysical withdrawal. Maybe I'm lucky but I didn't get any urge to smoke after the first couple of weeks when I was used to not lighting up any more."
"For me, I was telling myself I’d quit every time I bought a pack for about a month, and one day after buying a pack I mustered up the courage to smoke a couple, then break the rest of my pack in half and throw them away. Haven’t touched one since. "
Same here. Cold turkey and stayed away from triggers for a month. That was eight years ago and haven't touched one again. Did have a few nightmares where I woke up in a sweat thinking I had relapsed.
"I told myself a year in advance that I was gonna quit smoking. That way I had an entire year to mentally prepare for it. Idk if this is actually a good tip or not but it worked perfectly for me. Haven’t touched a cigarette since December 31, 2017."
"Just take a week off work when you do it. No need to lose your job over being an asshole while you're working on it. Best decision of my life. Also get a tracker to keep count of money saved, time saved, cigarettes smoked etc. I use Cessation Nation to this day. "
"I quit five months ago, the day I graduated college, and haven't looked back, other than for the first week."
"The first time I quit, for 5 months, I was driving and just compulsively threw my half pack of cigarettes out the window. 
Looking back I wish I didnt litter, though."
I actually found it more difficult the second week after quitting. The first week you are still motivated. The second week is when you are creating a new routine and your entire body is fucked up. After week 2 was so much better. 
"Chantix did it for me. Felt like cheating, but I couldn't have done it without the stuff."
"There’s no such thing as cheating when it comes to quitting.  
Fight as dirty as you can.  "
I'm currently on chantix now. I'm 5 days smoke free and going strong. 
I used Chantix too. It gave me crazy nightmares though
"This. Started taking it and, one day, just didn’t really have the craving. It was pretty amazing. Make sure you finish the cycle (it’s like eight weeks or something). 
Chewed a fair amount of gum for another few months after. "
I did this as well and I highly recommend it. Took the pain out of quitting and made it easy. I tried quitting so many times only to eventually fail. Tried campix once and have been smoke free for 5 years\~ now. I also liked the vivid dreams. 
"Chantix was how my husband and I both quit. I quit within 2 weeks, and my husband within 30 days. "
"I had used patches, tried cold turkey, but kept going back to smoking.
Got rx for chantix from my Dr.  Had an event coming up where I knew the urge to smoke was gonna be really high, so delayed the start of taking the chantix till after that event.
After a few weeks I got up one morning, went to have my morning smoke, took one drag and realized it tasted really bad!  Tossed it and have not light up since.  That was around 10 years ago."
"Same.  Taking chantix took my craving-thoughts from ""fuck it you've smoked for so long you're gonna get cancer anyway might as well enjoy yourself"" to ""well I sure would like one but I shouldn't"".  
Once the cravings got to that level my sincere desire to quit and significantly changing my routine so I could develop new habits that didn't involve smoking got me over the finish line.
Granted this was 3 months ago, and I still occasionally slip up and have a couple, but I haven't had a smoke in the morning, while at work, etc, in that whole time."
"Chantix is fucking amazing and this should really have more upvotes. I took chantix and just kept smoking like normal until one day I was just like, I don't want this. A few weeks later I was like ""damn I really want a cigarette"" so I went out and bought a pack, took two puffs off that first cigarette and was like ""nope, I actually don't want this"".  
I did eventually start smoking again much later on and was too lazy/embarrassed to ask for Chantix from my doctor. So I switched to vaping. My wife wants me to quit that too though, so I finally went and got Chantix again. The really odd thing is it didn't help me with vaping at all. Was so surprising. I still vape, but no cigarettes at least?"
Okay so I’ve heard great things about Chantix and not so great things. The great thing is that it actually takes away the urge to smoke. The not so great thing- crazy night terrors that seriously fuck with you. Did you experience any of that?

Chantic made me not want to smoke but also turned me batshit crazy
"I took Chantix and read the book recommended above (Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr). Chantix helped me through the first week or so (after the first week where you continue smoking while taking Chantix). Anyone thinking about using it, make sure you follow the instructions and eat regular meals. At that time I would usually only eat once a day (midday) and my stomach would be killing me around midnight until I ate something. Like actual pain, not ""hunger pains"" or feeling sick or something. 
I tried quitting with Chantix twice and had the same issue both times, so I know that was the culprit for sure. Second time I stopped taking the Chantix and used the motivation I gained from the book to finish quitting. Been 7.5 years now. "
Welbutrin for me.
Chantix is the only thing that worked for me. I tried many methods and failed repeatedly. I've even had to do chantix multiple times but I feel confident I'm finally done. 
"I'm 8 months smoke free because of Chantix.
I didn't set a ""quit"" date, it just became obvious that the cigarettes tasted like shit and didn't give me the same fix anymore.  I actually did not want them anymore.
I do believe that it pushed me into a bit of a depression, however, I had just started it a week before my mother passed, and then another series of fairly negative things happened, so I can't totally blame the Chantix.  I will say that there were a few nights around week 4 or so that I was just ridiculously angry that I COULDNT get a nicotine fix - smoking wouldnt give me any relief.  I learned that in the first week, though.
I've been off Chantix awhile now, and I get urges to smoke, sometimes - interestingly it isnt after meals like before, its when Im really angry.  But its easy to just ignore the urge, I mean, hell, Ive come this far.  I'm 100% certain I'm done."
"It helped me too. I'd already tried quitting cold turkey a few years before, and made it a few months before stupidly starting again.
Comparing cold turkey to Chantix, I'd say Chantix was like skipping the first 2 or 3 weeks of withdrawal symptoms.  Skipping the most intense part of it, but I still did *kinda* want to smoke sometimes, though I think that was just the psychological part at that point. But it was much easier to deal with the mental aspect having Chantix take the edge off the physical aspect.
I was lucky enough not to experience any side effects, at least not noticeably worse than the effects of quitting cold turkey."
I used champax which o assume is the same thing.  Absolute miracle drug.  I'd still be smoking now only for it.  3 years now. 
"Vape. But not in an obnoxious ""force other people to walk through vanilla, banana, sundae vapour""shit. Use it to have that hand to mouth action that is habitual. 
"
"I quit cold turkey because I found out I was pregnant, but my husband quit this way. Just the habit of going outside was hard to break. So he would vape and I would eat one of those little dum-dum suckers. Been smoke free for 6 straight years now."
I'd rather walk through banana than tobacco smoke 
"Agree, the Juul specifically is all that worked for me. Working on quitting that now."
"I quit last year with the help of a new gaping rig! Get your hardware online but go to a shop for the juice, because everyone makes it slightly different and most places will let you try before you buy!
E: I'm leaving it. "
"I bought a disposable e-cig today. I really have found I don’t really crave nicotine, it’s the act of smoking that’s a habit. I had planned to buy a rechargeable e-cig and a couple of weeks worth of juice but now I’m optimistic that a week or so on the disposables might be enough to break the habit. "
"In all honesty it is the nicotine dosage you are use to. Vapes/e-cigarettes let you control your dosage and you can decrease it gradually over time. Then when your down to 3mg or less, you start seeing less of a dependence on it. Eventually I just stopped all together within a year. Still vape during the cold months though, vape and coffee in the morning (used to be cig and coffee). Honestly it changed everything. "
"This. Keep your wattage low on a stock piece of kit so you don't look like fog rolling in off the ocean.
Black Friday will mark two years since my last smoke and 1 year since I stopped vaping. Picking a non tobacco flavor helped though as tobacco vape just tasted like nasty cheap cigarettes and made me want the real thing even more."
"Cigarettes have a ton of chemicals that your body becomes dependent on, quitting nicotine is like quitting coffee, you’re gonna be aggravated and have cravings but it’s manageable. Vape on the other hand is pretty much 4 ingredients, the only addictive one is nicotine, the transition from cigs to vape isn’t as difficult as quitting cold turkey but it’s a different sensation and you still crave the cigs. But if you can switch to vape it’s easier to quit, you can change your dosage down and do it at your own pace and it won’t hurt your health as bad."
"Yep, I was half pack a day for almost a decade. The trick if you really want vaping to stick is to go heavy dose and a good system for the start. It'll get you hooked harder on the vape for a while, but it's much easier to come down with weaker and weaker doses. Less than 2 years later, I'm still always carrying it around, but it's mixed at a very low 1.5mg nicotine, and I'm basically just working on kicking the routine now. Smoking after eating, during breaks, and while driving were always huge triggers, and that's hard to overcome. "
"Honestly this. I had no interest in quitting for the longest time until my friend started vaping and let me try some of his. Haven't even had the urge to pick up a cig since because the vape gives me the same satisfaction of hand to mouth like you said. 
Two months smoke-free, and not once has it ever felt like a battle. To anyone looking to quit I can't recommend it enough. "
"As a transition for smokers who lack resolve, a decent setup is the alternative to tobacco.
For the cold Turkey types that hit a wall, A cheap disposable can get some over the hump."
The Juul has helped me alot just with just going through the motions 
"Yup. Helped me out this year tremendously. Got to the point where I even grew tired of vaping. However, when I drink I now like to indulge in vaping (as opposed to ciggarettes). But it truly did help."
Yup. My wife got pregnant and she quit immediately. I vaped for a few months then quit that too.
"Particularly I found it easier to quit by slowly reducing the amount of nicotine in vape juice. After reducing to zero nicotine (over the course of like two years), I slowly stopped craving the action and eventually stopped carrying it around. It’s been over three years since then, and I don’t even get tempted by cigarettes, vapes, or nicotine at all anymore. 
Also by working down the amount of nicotine, your body becomes more sensitive to smaller amounts. So when I did try a cigarette after quitting, it was so overwhelming, it made me sick and not want to finish it. "
This is how I quit. I was able to gradually reduce the nicotine level of the fluid and also reduce the frequency since I could just take a few hits when the urge came on but not have to smoke an entire cigarette. Eventually I reduced both the nicotine craving and the habit craving enough to be able to quite. Took me about 6 months.
"This. Started this after two years of two packs a week and while it does cost more upfront, you do save money front less frequent trips to buy juices or coils. "
"Same. I just wanted to quit cigarettes, but the nicotine addiction itself isn't such an issue to me. I just use the small pen-like e-cigarettes with a menthol liquid (I don't like all the flavoured stuff) and it doesn't produce much steam or a scent. People sometimes comment that it smells quite nice, if anything.
I might deal with the nicotine addiction itself someday by weaning myself down to weaker liquids. But for now I'm happy with the vaping, I enjoy it and it has completely replaced smoking for me. I couldn't smoke a real cigarette anymore, they smell awful to me now.
I do remember when I made the switch from cigarettes to vaping that there was an immediate change in how I felt. I stopped coughing, I felt more energetic, things tasted better, my fingernails went from blue to a nice healthy pink... whatever vaping is for me, it's a *hell* of a lot healthier than smoking cigarettes and for now, I'm happy with that. "
"I did it this way. I got the vape oils where you could gradually reduce the amount of nicotine. Started with two weeks at a low mg lvl, then the next two weeks with the lowest possible option. After that, only oils with no nicotine. Used it often and I would usually pull it out before I thought cravings would come. Kinda worked to keep my mind off it and I would eventually realize I made another day without feeling too bad. 
After about 6 weeks I realized the thing was nothing more than a pacifier and I put in a drawer. Been 7 years. 
"
"The real fight doesn't begin until you are off nicotine completely. No chew, no gum, no patches, no vaping. All of them are better than smoking, so there is that ,but don't kid yourself nicotine is still your master. Source: I smoked 2 or more packs a day for about 40 years. Quit a hundred times. Currently nicotine free for 1.5 years. Still want 'em."
[deleted]
"Don't, it's not proven, but probably also very unhealthy. Just get over your urge to suck on things, you're not a baby anymore."
"I went and saw a hypnotist. He also is an MD and a Chiropractor as well with a long history of practice in his medical profession.
One session, walked out, never looked back.  No withdrawals, anger issues etc that I had felt with on previous attempts to quit.
About a year later, smoked a cigarette with a friend, wanted to see if I would pick the habit back up, never had the urge to pick up the habit.
Been 4 years now.  
The Docs perspective is that cigarettes are a coping mechanism, not a physical addiction, but a psychological one. 
Myself and now about 7 people I have recommended to go, all cigarette free.  He found something that seems to work well.
"
Ok were you from and how can I find one?
"I mean, nicotine is quite literally one of the most addictive substances we can use. that doesnt negate the power of psychologically deciding to stop and believing you can do it-- that shit is just as powerful to us :)"
"My parents smoked since before I was born, and a couple years ago they found out about some hypnotist who sells DVDs to quit smoking. They watched them and haven't had a cigarette since. Pretty wild."
I find it hard to believe that an MD is also a chiropractor... 
Yeah I have my doubts about his being an MD and chiropractor... 
But hows the sunken place?
"I smoked half a cigar the othet day, and the high I got from it was akin to the feeling I get after finishing exercises for two hours. It's so intoxicating and scary that you could sink so easily."
Currently cutting down and managed to get down to 2 - 3 per day. Using a vape to help with this. Current motivation is saving money for Christmas so hope I can stick at it! 
"Try to avoid caffeine as much as possible, in the morning I would have an apple to wake me up using the natural sugar. Something to have a hand/mouth interaction helped as well, I bought a non-nicotine based e-cigarette with a light up tip just for that more realistic look to my brain. Lastly I used some basic 3-step nicotine patches. Hope these points help out, good luck with Christmas. "
"Using a vape definitely helped me as well. Smoked a pack a day, went down to 1 or 2 a day and eventually just quit smoking."
You’re doing great! I quit in 1984 (yes I am old). Life after cigs is much better. I have no helpful tips other than willpower. I just decided to quit and I did. It is something I had wanted to do for awhile. You got this!
"I’m right where you are. Vape and using an app to slowly cut down. Currently on 3 a day. My motivation is coming from how much quicker my skin is healing. I open boxes all day so the skin around my nails was always fucked up. I now have cuticles again! I know it's small, but having visual proof that my health is getting better is giving me a kick up the arse to keep going."
"Best of luck to you! I will say this, from my personal experience I wouldn't try ""cutting back"" or ""weaning off"". I tried this the first time and it was hell. It's like slowly torturing yourself and it lifts up the cigs/vape you do smoke on a pedestal.  
  
Second time I quit cold turkey and haven't looked back (been ~2 years). Honestly 72 hours is all it really takes for the worst of it to be over, so remove all smoking accessories (ashtrays, lighters, etc) and just try to keep yourself busy with something you enjoy. It varies obviously from person to person but for me day 1 wasn't bad, just cravings. Day 2 was tough, irritable, couldn't sleep well, etc. Day 3 things started to smooth out and by day 4 I felt less irritable, was able to sleep normal, and only had cravings when I performed tasks I normally smoked afterwards.    
  
The most surprising thing to me was the week AFTER I quit my appetite suddenly shot through the roof! Seriously I always felt hungry and ended up snacking almost non-stop during the day. So ya, you may gain a few pounds if that happens to you too but even that goes away after about a month or 2.  "
"I'm completely on vape myself, but now I'm just addicted to that instead.  
I can't recommend enough asking your doctor about Chantix. It worked wonders. The quitting process was actually effortless. I just didn't want them anymore. Simple as that.  
Only reason I vape still is because Chantix seems to have no effect on it with me, which is unfortunate. Worked great though with cigarette smoking."
"I did that for a long time.  This sounds a little out there, but in order to really quit I had to make peace with the fact that I can never have another cigarette.  In unsuccessful attempts, I had it in the back of my mind that I could have 1 or 2 a day, or on special occasions.  The truth is that I'll be right back where I started if I did that.
"
"Sorry to say, but all it takes is discipline and resolve. The way it worked for me was that 1, I saw that my wife was feeling really nauseated. She wouldn't say anything, but I could see it in her face. I just had to stop hurting her. That, plus we were planning to start a family. Once those two things sunk in and I made my resolution, I never went back. I only tried to quit once, and that was it. Haven't smoked since 2004."
I went cold turkey after I started smelling my hands and realized I had to vigorously rinse with soap and water just to get that disgusting smell off me. I didn't want my hands or clothes to smell like an ash tray anymore.
Yep it's one of those things with no real trick other than to just do it.
"Yep, similar story here. It was easy, once I had a reason to."
"My friend (male) had a child and he just stopped smoking one day and never did it again.  I'm not sure how he did it, but he doesn't talk about it.  It was a really weird thing - I was so used to him going outside for smokes and such.  
I would probably smoke, but nicotine always gives me an 'impending doom' feeling for some reason.  Unless I'm on amphetamines, then it feels really nice to smoke - like water to a thirsty man."
This is how I quit as well. Just stopped buying cigarettes and haven’t gone back. Yes it sucks and yes sometimes I want to smoke but knowing I just could but make the choice not to keeps me going. 
"Similar here. Had a kid, switched to vaping for 3 months, then just quit."
"Same thing here, i had tried and failed several times, then we got engaged and I had this horribly vivid day dream of getting emphysema or COPD or lung cancer and becoming a burden on her financially and physically (not to mention the emotional burden of seeing a loved one die slowly). I had to stop going out with our friends for a couple of months, after that saying no was really easy (without alcohol or the social pressure of my friends smoking--both my big triggers).  The cravings never truly disappear, but they diminish in intensity and frequency until not smoking is easier than giving in."
"You say ""all it takes is discipline and resolve"" but then go right into the powerful emotional reasons that motivated you to quit. I think the second part is what it really takes."
"Come on mate it’s not that hard, I’ve quit 4 times this morning"
"Understanding that the urge to smoke isn't an urge to feel relief. It's anxiety induced from the habit. Once you fundamentally understand that cigarettes aren't ""calming your nerves"" they're the reason for you feeling restless in the first place it helps you resist the urge to feed that nicotine bug. "
"I quit because I got more and more concerned about my skin/looks aging as I got older. At the time I had no problem smoking because, in my mind, I was young and able to 'spring back' from anything I did to my body, but being in my 20s and having the vaguest suggestion of wrinkles totally changed my tone and convinced me to make some changes in my life before it's too late. Sucks because I love cigarettes but it wasn't that hard to quit, it feels like another part of a beauty regimen."
This too for me.  I didn't want to get smokers lips.  Yikes.  
Same here! Every time I see someone older smoking I look at their skin... always slightly grayish and sallow looking.  And smokers lips are the worst!
"okay so i'm 4 days in with no cigarette, i've tried to quit twice before and this is the longest i've gone. i've found the only time it will work is if you seriously want to quit yourself, not from people pressuring you. smoke what you've got left by rationing it out for the next few days, don't buy any more and go cold turkey once they're gone. i'm vaping through this, helps a lot. also for nicotine cravings, i learnt that we're not addicted to nicotine as such but to endorphin release. i'm putting time into things i enjoy like painting, CONSIDERING exercising at the moment. this should give you some endorphins to keep you happy! "
Good luck! Keep at it. I had the hardest time quitting. I smoked for 20+ years. What worked for me was the patch. I used the Step 2 one and it helped so much with the cravings.  The vape helped with the habit
Yeah so every time I wanted one after work I would go down to the gym or go for a run. it SUCKED and I fuckin hated it but I sure as shit didn't want one after working out
"Hey man, great job. Just in case you aren't aware, it only gets easier past day 4. Days 3 and 4 are often the worst. That's not to say days 5, 6, and 7 are easy, but they're often easier than days 3 and 4. You're almost over that hill!"
"I am also four days in, maybe 5. Let's help one another. I am going to PM you, if that's OK. "
"My mom used to smoke a lot. she was only able to quit because she got very sick, and couldnt breathe if she inhaled smoke. After she got better about 2 weeks later she just didnt start again.
it might not work for everybody, but if theres a reason you might be unable to smoke for a while, just try not to start again."
"This happened to me a little over three weeks ago.  Couldn't breathe so couldn't smoke.  Four days passed and I decided to not smoke any more when I could breathe again.  Rituals, routines are the hardest part.  I chew on coffee stirrer straws and vape at 3 mg after eating for a few minutes."
"Don’t smoke a cigarette today, just get through the day without one. Then tomorrow do the same thing, just get though the day without one. Small little attainable goals working toward a larger long term goal is an easy way to break it down. I don’t even remember when I quit because that day doesn’t matter, only today."
You have to want to.  
"A million times this.
If you’re not doing it for yourself, you’re not going to follow through."
"We quit using Chantix. The side effects can be tough; thankfully we didn't really experience anything bad except for mild depression. 
It was really like flipping a switch. At our doctors advise, we smoked for the first 14 days (instead of 'just' 10). After our last cigarette, we destroyed what we had left and never looked back. I didn't expect it to be that easy. We've been smoke free since 2012. 
Edit: We = My husband and I. I couldn't have quit alone :) "
"Worked for me too! A combination of the medication & going on holiday with a non-smoker during the last part of the treatment course (ie. no longer smoking but still taking the tablets). I’ve never looked back. 
You just have to get to the point where they stink if you smell someone smoking. Then you’re on the home run!"
">we smoked for the first 14 days (instead of 'just' 10).  
Might not work for everyone, but I just completely ignored that part of the book and kept smoking without trying to quit. Sure enough somewhere around day 14 or so I just wasn't smoking anymore. Didn't want it. About a week or so after that I got a craving, broke down and bought a pack. Took two puffs off one cigarette and was like ""nope, that's not what I wasn't at all"".
"
We? Are you schizophrenic?
"The way I see it, *we* can do whatever *we* want. We are Venom."
Stop hanging around smokers
This is what helped me. Took a break from drinking for a few months too.
I took about 2 weeks away from my group of friends that smoke. It really does help.
Solid advice.
Great idea unless you work in a bar....
"Use e-cig for transition. Here is how I do when I was burning through roughly 2 packs a weeks at the time, and been smoking for 12 years give or take. I cut half cigarette intake and pick up the strongest e-juice. After a few weeks, I will keep cutting cigarette intake. I will cut until I'm completely off then I will start cutting on e-juice nicotine level. Then I quit e-cig for good. The whole process took me about a year and a half.
 
"
"Once I SERIOUSLY made up my mind, EVERY time I  craved I told myself ""$10 a day,  $10 a day, $10 a day"". Something to keep me motivated is simply be within smelling distance of someone who smokes. "
"That’s been the biggest motivator for me and just about the only reason I quit, according to my tracker I quit smoking 678.97 dollars ago and it feels amazing. "
"After 26 years of smoking and countless efforts I'm off smoking for a year now.  
The things that worked for me: quitting on vacation, every soft moment I had I went on doing something active that got my mind on something else (videogames, sport/running). I used CBD oil (without THC) once every 2 days to help me sleep better through the first 2 weeks. Honestly, I hardly had any difficulty quitting...  
Good luck man!"
Another vote for Chantix.  Take your second pill of the day in the early evening instead of later to avoid the weird dreams.
"I never got the weird dreams like some people say. When I tried the patch there were def weird crazy vivid dreams, but never with Chantix. So long as they're not bad dreams, it can fun."
I've been thinking of getting this. Do you remember how much it costs?
"Take a tab of LSD, smoke cigarette, be disgusted. Quit. At least that's how it happened to me. "
I love smoking on lsd :(
"When you are tripping and your holding that cigarette really start asking yourself “what am I actually doing with this thing and what is it doing to me” a million thoughts, ideas and feelings racing through your head before the cigarette is even out. This will definitely change anyone’s perspective on smoking and will no doubt allow a lot of people to quit easily. "
Lol i like this idea. Now where can i buy some of that LSD medication?
"You have to want to quit. Because you want to, not because you know you should. They're very different. When you want to, you do. I decided one night after 15 years chewing tobacco that planning to quit was stupid. I  decided that ""after this <can / pack / week / month > I'll quit"" was a completely unnecessary delay. Almost at random one Sunday, I just stopped. That was 2012.
A staggering number of people can't quit because they just don't want to. They know they should, because it's logical, so they try and try. When you decide that you *want* to quit, there's no need for any distraction or intervention. You just quit. 
I'll be upvoted by cold turkey quitters and downvoted by people who think they're ready but keep failing and don't want to admit to themselves that they really don't want to quit at all."
This was my experience as well. A switch got flipped and I threw out the rest of my pack and never looked back.
"This is 100% true. I was in welding school and everyone around me smoked. My vape was quickly forgotten as I jumped on the bandwagon for 8 months. Then as soon as I was out of school, I was the only one that smelled bad and I didn’t want to do it anymore. Now back on the vape and I haven’t touched a cig since. 
It is, most definitely, wanting to do it. 
Don’t be afraid to admit that you’re not ready to quit yet. It’ll make you realize sooner when you do actually want to quit. "
"You’re right. I was kind of (??) a cold turkey quitter. Kinda not. But ultimately, you need to want to quit. I wanted to because I couldn’t breathe normally and I felt my heart doing weird stuff. "
"With Chantix you can quit even if you don't truly want to. Or at least some people can anyway. For me it completely eliminated the desire for them. At one point I had a fond memory/craving, broke down and bought a pack. Took two puffs and it was gross and did nothing for me.  
Cold Turkey advocates can knock it if they want, but not everyone is in a place where they truly want to quit, but know they should. If Chantix can help them be a healthier person and their doctor says it's good, why not?  "
"Don't say to yourself ""I'm giving up smoking"", say ""I don't smoke anymore"". Makes cold turkey much easier. Good luck! It's possible :)"
"I'd go a bit further, and say don't quit at all. What I mean is, I packed in in July 2007. But I didn't really - I'm simply a non-practising smoker to this day. I can have a smoke if I want, but I choose not to. It's hard to explain, but after years of trying to give up, this worked. The thought of never smoking again, ever, can be quite overwhelming at first, and you can resent it. It also helps if you end up scavving a ciggie off a mate when drunk - you don't beat yourself up about it, because it's OK - you're still a smoker anyway. Worked for me, anyway, along with patches for the first week or so to get over the physical side of it. Reckon I was in the clear after a month or so, but the old saying about getting urges on the threes (3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months) seemed oddly true."
"I disagree. A friend quit smoking by playing a Jedi mind trick on himself. Every time he lit up a cigarette, didn’t matter if he was alone or in a crowd of 1,000 people, he would say, out loud, “I am a non-smoker. I do not smoke,” as he was lighting it. At first you feel silly, and it just doesn’t sit right, because you know you’re lying to yourself. Eventually, it becomes a mantra you say to yourself to get through the next hour, or 15 minutes, or even the next minute if the craving is bad enough, until the craving inevitably passes. Worked for 30 years and counting for my friend, and 16 years and counting for me."
"That’s what did it for me.  I wasn’t quitting smoking, I just don’t smoke.  Just like I don’t do heroin or murder people.   It isn’t hard to not do those things because they are terrible and I don’t do them.  Just like smoking is terrible and I don’t do it.  Mindset is everything. "
"Day 3 is the hardest for the body, take that  the day off work or plan it on the weekend.
After a couple of weeks the physical craving will never again be as strong as the mental one.
Try to quit when life is at a ""normal"" or lower level of stress for you, stress is the hardest part of quitting if smoking is a crutch for you like out was for me.
Understand that the cravings will never really go away completely. They will get less powerful and less frequent but they will never be gone. Accept that now. A good friend of mine quit in his 30s and told me before he died in his late 80s that he still got cravings.
I was 1-4 packs a day for ~9 years. Been clean over 10 now. Discipline is the key, this is more about mental addiction than physical."
"4 packs a day??????
I can't even get 1 pack a day on my most stressful days, 3/4 pack makes me feel sick.  How smooth were your cigarettes?  "
Willingness and enough prior failed attempts to really want it. It's not easy but it can be done. Haven't had a smoke in 2 years and 8 months.
"I am only 8 weeks without one, so grain of salt etc. 
Motivation: I got married and my wife said ""it's not fair that you intentionally leave me alone at the end""
Techniques: 
understanding that every time you are having a smoke, you are making an active decision.
Mental framing is important. I am not giving up for example, because smoking provides no value so there is nothing to give up. I am stopping instead.
I gamify (sp?) it. Counting the days until my next achievement.
Count the days like you would in AA. 
Replacement. I use lozenges as they last for long enough for me to stop thinking about it, taste nice and hit the spot. 
Habit. There were times when I would get up to have a smoke because that is what I would do through habit. Even 15-20 days in. I would do something instead. Walk, press ups, video games for a while etc.
I was off work, which is not available to everyone. 
Effort. It was hard at first. Then it got easier. Now I am not willing to break my streak and start again. The habit has gone and the replacement works well. 
Don't stop at the first hurdle, you might not be quitting at day 1. You are just trying to set a high score. Keep going with that and you will make it further each time.
Good luck if you are going to go for it. I smoked heavily for 15 years and if I can do it (hopefully) then a high % of the smokers are up to it."
"For me it was one day at a time. Set short term goals to make the process more manageable. Recognize that the process will be hard and annoying. The first part is easy, willpower can take you far, and the physical addiction is over in a few days. The truely hard part is breaking the habit - it took me 2 months before I stopped thinking about cigs at every commercial break on the tv. Reward yourself with the money you save, eat whatever you want, your metabolism will change anyway - gaining some weight is worth it. Good luck."
"Smoke free since April 2001!
I grew up in a home where both parents smoked, I started smoking myself about 14 years old because... I'm stupid. 
By the time I quit in 2001 I was up to 30 a day, 40 if I went out drinking at night. I was getting my cigarettes illegally through a guy at work so they were roughly £25 a stick instead of £35-40,  Now I'm pretty damn sure these were counterfeit ones or at the very least cheaper versions for foreign markets.  I noticed a vast deterioration in my lungs and I became concerned. 
The easiest way to stop is wanting to stop for yourself, not for your partner, not because the doctors said so, but because YOU WANT TO!  
Back then Patches were new, bloody expensive and not available for free on the NHS,  I did the large patches and you had a chart to stick a little blue sticker on each day, I think the large patches lasted 20 days, then medium ones for the same and then I couldn't be arsed with he small ones so just stopped.
17 years later I still get weird urges once a blue moon for about 20 seconds that I really want one.  I don't mind people smoking around me, which was one of the thing I was most worried about once I decided to stop.  The first time I went out for a beer or two  I was so relieved because it didn't make me want one like I had imagined it would.  
I still enjoy beer to this day!"
"10 years listening to friends and family try to sway me to stop smoking. 'You should really stop smoking' blah blah blah. Ive ignored them every single time until recently I told myself ""I want to stop smoking"" realize that it's not going to happen unless you want the change for yourself. That's where it started for me. Good luck.
"
You have to do it for you. I tried to quit for someone else and I relapsed so much. 
"The nicotine patch took the edge off for me.  But I found the habit more difficult to break than the addiction.  I liked those moments in the day where I could take 5min for a smoke.  I just kept in mind that the longer I abstained, the less of a habit it would be, and that was true.  After a few weeks, it wasn't nearly as difficult."
"Hooray finally something I can answer. I smoked for 15 years and quit 11 months ago.
First, WANTING to quit is the key. That's step one in the mental battle.
Second, get some kind of nicotine aid at least in the first few weeks. That's to help the PHYSICAL battle. Personally I got patches. Use for as long as YOU need not as long as the pack says. I stopped after 2.5 weeks total because I felt I didn't need it anymore but we're all different.
Third, continue reminding yourself WHY you quit and how you've reached the goal and now it's about keeping it. Health, money, time, social etc.
Four, find something to do with the TIME. I realised how much time went to smoking and had to replace it with something else to avoid slipping. I drink a lot of water now by carrying a water bottle (good for the psychological habbit of bringing something to your mouth). Also eating a piece of fruits when getting the craving helped. Plenty of exercise was also key for me as health was part of my reason.
You CAN free yourselves from the shackles of tobacco, you CAN regain your health, money and time. Most importantly, you WILL thank yourselves for it.
Good luck!"
"I saw my aunt dying of cancer. I saw her on her deathbed. She wasn’t a smoker but cancer is a very likely ending for smokers. I saw her in pain and agony. She was out of it and hallucinating constantly. I saw her 12 hours before her death. 
I don’t want such an ending. Although nonsmokers can and do get cancer, I do not want to facilitate it or bring my death any closer. I do not want to be in that kind of pain. I know I will regret every drag at that point. I know I will feel as though I have betrayed my son since I won’t be able to join him in most of his life’s accomplishments. And for what? A nasty habit? Something that I can get rid of? 
The strength that it will take to quit will be much easier and short term than the pain and helplessness I will feel later if I don’t quit. 
So I quit. Just like that. Cold turkey. After 2 years, I started again. As I write this post, I quit again. For good. "
"Thats great, I'm so proud of you. Be strong!"
"When I started smoking I thought I'll never push my some time future baby around whilst smoking. Nearly 20 year later I changed jobs, smoking was becoming socially unacceptable, and took the opportunity of a new routine to cut back. Then started trying for a baby. I was ready, if you aren't mentally ready it must be really hard. A baby was my life long 'time to give up', I just didn't imagine I'd be smoking for 20 years. "
Worked well for me to have a buddy. A good friend and I quit in 2011 together. It was helpful to have someone to share the beginning stress and urges with. Neither one of us has touched a cigarette since!
"Came in to say this.  I quit at the same time as my brother.  I'm sure it depends on your personality, but for me having the extra incentive of ""if I cheat, I'm letting him down too"" probably kept me from relapsing."
"Disciplin and a workplace without breaks.
"
vape?
"Imo vaping is not the answer. You're merely changing the delivery device of nicotine. Sure it's ""healthier"" but what makes you think you NEED nicotine? Why not give it up? Vaping without nicotine is pointless"
"Fucking want it. 
If you don't want to quit, you won't. Don't matter if your kid or friend begs you to do it. You'll say the same shit every time. ""Eventually."" Or ""I will. Once this pack runs out."" Whatever the context, you have to WANT to do it."
"100%. My dad can't bring himself a tiniest bit of sympathy for kids stuck in an area with smoke. My grandma got lung cancer for this reason, still smokes. You gotta want it, it doesn't matter for literally any other factor. Nicotine is a monster."
"You have to be to the point where you are disgusted with it. If you try quitting but still enjoy smoking, it won’t work. "
This isn’t even close to being true. I loved smoking and would go right back to it if I wasn’t afraid of dying young.
"Not necessarily true. I loved smoking, but quit anyway."
do not buy them. adjust your route so you dont pass a point of sale etc. also helps with food. if you buy chips you will eat it if you dont buy it you doby consume it
It’s amazing how rarely I go into convenience store after quitting. Never need a quick stop at 7-11 again.
"Tried this with cold turkey quit attempt. Got rid of all cigarettes in the house and lighters. Worked for like the first couple days, then couldn't take it one night and walked through a bad blizzard to the nearest place that was still open which was pretty far."
"I ran out of money for a few weeks, I couldn't afford cigarettes so I stopped buying them.  I didnt really miss it that much."
"I used to smoke a lot during my high school/university days. Not as much as some people but a pack a day wasn’t out of the question sometimes. 
When I decided to cut down later it wasn’t a problem for me at all but analyzing the situation I can see a few factors that probably helped: 
- changing the routine and those around you. This isn’t as easy for everyone but I can tell that I want a smoke more if I’m in the company of people I used to have it with, or in similar situations. 
- don’t think this is forever. I can have a pack or two once or twice a year when we go traveling or something like this. And I think knowing this helps with not thinking about it too much. 
- do more sports. There is nothing I want less after a workout than a cigarette. 
From experience by relatives, those who smoked a lot for longer (10,20 years etc) will never really quit and be like before. So don’t try. Be ready to accept this truth and make it your goal to just do it less and less over time. "
My dad did as many situps as he could every time he had a craving. He said the association of the craving to the pain made the cravings go away. He might just be crazy.
Behavioral psychologists would not think him crazy
"I followed a famous philosopher: Do or do not, there is no try. "
"I switched to a vape. I started on 6Mg nic for a month or 2 then dropped to 3Mg. I could probably drop to a 0 but I've stuck with 3. I smoked between 1.5-2 packs a day when I quit, and at $10 for a pack of Marlboro menthols ($140+ a week), that was motivation enough to quit.
I pay $30 for 120Ml of juice that lasts me about a week, and I haven't smoked a cigarette in 2 or 3 years now. I'm at the point now where the smell of a cigarette makes me sick and gives me a headache. I'm not gonna lie, there are still times when I really crave a cigarette, like when I'm super stressed out, or I'm hanging out with smokers, at that point I remind myself of all the reasons I quit.
My grandfather also ended up with a tumor behind one of his ears, which the doctors informed him was a direct result of his smoking in the past, even though he quit decades ago. My grandmother also had a mass found in one of her lungs (They discovered it after my grandparents were in a car accident and she had x-rays done), she never smoked a day in her life, It was the second hand smoke that did it. Fortunately, they found the mass when it was relatively new, and were able to remove it before it had the chance to metastasize. This is the only time I've ever been grateful to hear somebody got into a car accident. "
Juul. 
"Smoked a pack a day from 16-27, haven’t smoked a single cigarette since, I just turned 40.
Cold fucking turkey. Don’t vape, don’t reduce, just quit nicotine and commit.
Don’t quit for a period of time, you just think about that cigarette you eventually get to have. Decide you aren’t smoking again, and when the craving hits you, put the thought out of your mind instead of wallowing in it.
After 2 weeks, it stops hurting and becomes an empty space like a missing tooth. After this it is much easier."
I discovered weed.
"I was smoking both, but I needed to stop smoking tobacco. I had tried quiting, but no one likes a quitter, so I just had to stop smoking. 
 I found some really cheap weed and rolled about 60 joints. Every time I wanted a cigarette, I would smoke a joint. The quality was low, and it wouldn't get me high, but it satisfied my need for something to smoke. 
My third day in, I no longer wanted to smoke cigarettes and I no longer wanted to smoke that shit weed. Over the next two weeks, any time I had a craving, I would smoke a joint. I stopped smoking for a good 2 years until I picked it up again during a night of drinking. 
I did the same thing after a year and stopped smoking for another year or so. The last time I stopped smoking, I used this method and a non nicotine vape for the times I feel like going back. 
It's been over seven years now and my lungs feel great, I no longer gag and hack out huge dark wads of mucus, and, weed & food taste a lot better! "
I have zero interest in ever drinking alcohol again after discovering weed
I used the patch and jolly ranchers for the oral fixation. Took a long time but worth it
I stopped about 8 years ago-> Nicotine patch and Altoids did it for me. Additional bonus-> The Nicotine patches gave me the most amazing dreams I've ever had. Nothing has come close since...
I never ever remember my dreams. But I *did* remember the vivid and grotesque nightmares patches gave me. Shits wild
"Tell yourself you're not quitting. You're just taking a break. The hardest part is facing your last cigarette and the fear of never having one again. Set a physical goal in the future exercise way and tell yourself when you accomplish this, you can smoke again. I say this because my lungs were hurting and if I was in shape enough to complete this long bike ride I wanted to do then my lungs would be better, right? Well, once that day comes, you'll probably not want to smoke a cigarette afterwards. "
"If you really want to quit then you’ll quit. I got fed up with being out of breath doing basic things like walking upstairs, I caught a cold and I had the worst cough of my life. I was coughing up black tar and i was in pain. So I quit cold turkey."
"Also one more note: don’t ever say “this is my last cigarette ever” while you’re smoking it, because that basically ensures it won’t be "
"I don’t necessarily agree with that. Eventually, the statement will be true. A friend of mine, in the process of quitting, would say, out loud, as he was lighting his cigarette, “I am a non-smoker. I do not smoke.” Didn’t matter if he was alone or in a room with 1,000 people, he said it, every time. At first you feel silly, and it just doesn’t sit right, because you know you’re basically lying to yourself. But eventually it becomes a mantra that you say to yourself to get you through the next hour, or 15 minutes, or even the next minute, until the craving passes, which it inevitably does. My friend has been smoke free for 30 years now, and it’s been 16 for me. The Jedi mind trick works."
What worked for me was not to get rid of them. I carried an unopened pack of cigarettes around for the better part of a year.  This calmed me because they were there if I needed them but I was choosing not to use them.  I know it sounds crazy but it worked for me.  It was kind of like I was beating them right in their own face.  I threw the pack away once I felt like I was over it.  I will be honest in that I have tried to smoke a few times since then but the taste of it makes me nauseous now.  I can't even kiss my husband when he has an occasional smoke when we are out drinking.  
"Start up weightlifting, commit 5 days a week and train until you reach your physical limit, then train a bit more.   
Works a treat."
"I get this question from my friends a lot. Didn’t start smoking until 20, started slow like everyone does, got up to a pack a day in a year or so, then about this this time last year, I just decided I didn’t want to smoke anymore and so I stopped. I still have one on occasion, or I’ll buy a few packs when I go to music festivals. 
The biggest thing that people don’t understand, or maybe refuse to accept, is that you have to actually ***want*** to quit. You can want to quit because you know it’s bad or expensive, but you still want to smoke. You just don’t want the consequences, stigma, etc. 
At the end of the day, you just have to stop buying them. "
"Stop buying them is actually a really good tip. Or if you buy a pack because you ""need"" a smoke, throw it out mostly full after when you feel like a failure. After doing that a couple times you realize how much money you're wasting. "
"I got these minty toothpicks from CVS called Stim-U-Dent. Anytime I wanted a cig, I would just suck on a toothpick. Not the same sensation at all, but enough to calm my cravings for a little while. Good luck!"
"So the habit was always more addictive to me than the chemicals, and the habit is actually a lot of little habits. For example, stop smoking in your car. It's easier than quitting altogether. If you want a cigarette that bad, pull over. I smoked from 15 - 28. I stopped smoking in my car at 20. I stopped smoking at work at 23.
I reached a point where I was smoking 3 a day between getting home from work and bedtime. I cut those out one at a time. The last habit I had to break was 1 before bed. My trick was a shot of whiskey. I would sip it slowly, which is uncomfortable af, but it burned the back of my throat like a cigarette. Eventually I'd gone 2 weeks without a cigarette and I stopped with the whiskey. My dumb brain had only been in that habit for 2 weeks so it was easy to kick.
You will need to spend time away from other smokers. I moved away from my friends. My friends who smoke are still my friends, but I spent a little less time with them for a while. Don't be near them while they smoke...even if it means sitting inside alone for 5 min. You may want to find a game to play on your phone in those situations. Replace the habit with another habit, but then I wouldn't use the same habit for every situation. People who smoke all the time and replace it with vaping just vape all the time. Same with candy, exercise, whatever. But if you mix and match your distractions then you won't have this other overwhelming new habit to deal with."
I used to have a whiteboard that I updated each week with how much money I’d saved so far. 
"Marry a gorgeous, wonderful in every way person who hates cigarettes with a fiery passion. Worked for me."
"Understand that you are going to lie to yourself about why you ‘need’ just one more cigarette. You’ll tell yourself you’re stressed, or you deserve it, or whatever. Avoid that one cigarette for a few weeks and you’ll wake up one day trying to remember how long it’s been since you stopped "
"I started worry about what my teeth were going look like, didn't take much more convincing for me."
"all these people mention the potential health problems, for some reason i couldn't care at all about the side affects down the line, maybe that tells me something about my myself, but for me... it was the money saving... i got one of those apps that tracks the money saved, i was spending over £300 a month on cigs. could buy so much cool shit with that sort of money being literally burnt away."
"Watch a family member die of lung cancer. Pretty morbid, but until the consequences are real, it’s very hard to quit. 
Lost my mother and father-in-law to lung cancer 3 months apart. Never touched one after that. "
"I’m sorry for your loss. I’m dealing with that now.
My grandmother smoked for 40 years and is currently limited to the 25’ that her oxygen tube will let her walk from her bedroom. My mom has to stay with her 24 hours a day and even with a new, and really promising lung cancer treatment, she’s still not half the person she was a few years ago. My best friend’s mother is currently on her death bed with lung cancer. She found out last spring and will be gone by the end of the weekend.
I quit about 5 years ago and after this, I don’t think I’ll ever casually pick one up again. It’s not worth it."
Wellbutrin worked for me. 
well I used to smoke 40 a day. Personally I found that having a heart attack was a very easy motivation to give up. Just over a year this week.
"I hate to be that guy, and I still use nicotine as a disclaimer, but I vape now.. Not benign, still small particles getting in your lungs, but no burnt carbons. All studies show in the conclusion portion that the amount of stuff entering your lungs is more benign than cigarettes. I used to smoke a pack of American Spirits a day (before that, Reds, Newports, etc.) for several years, then started vaping in 2012. Haven't had more than 10 cigarettes since. The risk factor of heart disease remains as long as you use nicotine too, and the risk is just as high if not higher than a cigarette user, so not a great recommendation, but kept me from smoking actual cigarettes."
"Vaping really helped me stop smoking, mainly because it was something I could do to change that didn't force me to abandon my smoking friends."
"My stepson constantly made comments about me quitting. When I mentioned getting a vape, he got so excited. I had to follow through.
What I would NOT recommend is trying to just cut back while switching. I ended up still constantly wanting a cig. I finally just stopped buying them and relied solely on the vape. I'm at 3mg of nicotine and ready to switch to no nicotine.
I haven't had a cig in almost 5 months and now the smell makes me gag.
Edit: I also downloaded an app (Quit Tracker) that tracks my progress. It really puts things in perspective. So far, I've regained 16 days of life and saved almost $500."
Just vape.
Have someone close to you die of horrible lung cancer. 
"I smoked for about 5-6 years.  I got sick with a really nasty sinus infection that caused me to not want to smoke for about a week.  Once I was feeling better, I decided to see how long I could go without a cig.  I am now 2 years clean this month!"
Do not say “I can quit anytime I want” then refuse to quit 
"You have to want to. Tried many times cause I should, or was supposed to and always went crazy. The one time I actually wanted to, Thanksgiving day 2005, it was easy"
Cold turkey is the only way. You'll never ween yourself off of cigarettes.
"Step 1. Get a girlfriend and promise her you'll quit. 
Step 2. Lie to her and say you have quit, but continue to smoke for 5 more years without her knowledge.
Step 3. Move in with said girlfriend."
Smoking used to be a way for me to handle my anxiety. I changed my circumstances and removed the major sources of anxiety. I literally just forgot to buy another pack. That was five years ago. 
"The hardest part was deciding it was time to quit. After that, it's just sticking to your guns. After the irritability passes, there's gonna be a long period of time where you still have cravings and it didn't feel like its getting any easier. This lasts months. But, slowly and surely you'll make it past this.
 
Also, I didnt use any nicotine products to help quitting, but I did allow myself a cigarette or two if I was drunk. I'm not a big drinker so this was rare enough to not negatively impact the whole endeavor. I think having a well defined outlet for cheating can help. Another thing to help is remind yourself how gross it is. Google pictures of tar, and lifelong smokers' teeth, and really learn to appreciate the feeling of clear lungs."
"Cold turkey. Just decided I was done. Never looked back. Sucks at first but if you really want to quit, that’s the way to go. "
I started smoking when I was 9 and wasn't able to stop for the next 42 years. That was a dozen years ago. You can do it too. I tried many things but cold turkey worked best. I usually hate giving advice but will say I  find when I have a craving I get up and go do something where I  can't smoke. Or anything that will occupy the next 30 to 60 seconds while I try to forget I wanted a cigarette. I wish you all the strength you will need. Everything tastes wonderful now. Something to look forward to.
"Exercise helped a lot with the stress. But I honestly think just sweating a lot helped just as much, or more, with getting over the initial hump and impulse. I don't know if there's any validity to that, but I did believe that I could sweat it out of my system. That led to lots of running, as well as hot hot steam showers whenever possible."
"If you gave up smoking, even if you smoked your last one ten seconds ago, then consider yourself a non-smoker. An ex-smoker. You’re not TRYING to quit; you DID quit.
It might sound glib and dismissive, but I went from 30-a-day to quitting, ten years ago so I’ll risk the downvoted to say it - it really is as simple as just not having another cigarette.
I’m convinced that half the problem is that smokers EXPECT it to be super difficult, because others say it’s difficult, which in turn makes it actually difficult - like a big self-fulfilling prophecy.
Compared to other shit you HAVE to do in life (study for exams, break up with lovers, take a shit when you are constipated, grieve the loss of a family member, get up after three hours’ sleep to work a double shift, tolerate a shitty cold for a week) stopping smoking is simply not difficult or unpleasant. 
Once you believe this, you shouldn’t really struggle."
"Alan Carr’s Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Read it once and quit for 6 months... unfortunately broke and started smoking again, so read it one more time and haven’t smoked in 7 years. Do it!"
THIS!!!! 
"My wife, myself and a previous best friend all read Allen Carr's ""Easy Way To Stop Smoking"" We've all been smoke free for almost 5 years. The book is great, but having the support of a loved one was really key for me. "
"I had good luck with this book, too. "
"Here’s how I quit smoking. I quit one day, almost all day. Then I quit the next day, all day. Then the next day, almost all day. And repeat.
The day I knew I was over the hump I hadn’t smoked a cigarette in 6 months (but I had “quit” every day for over a year). I walked past someone on the street smoking and it wasn’t till 2 blocks down that I realized I hadn’t even intentionally  inhaled their used smoke to get a fix.
Quitting is a bitch and you have to do it 10x100 times before it stops being something you think about. But having quit? It’s fucking amazing."
"There are no tips, no drugs, nothing, to help you quit. If you really don't want to quit, you never will. Something has to motivate you big time. For me it was a co-worker. He was a 4 pack a day smoker and he quit cold turkey. I figured if he can quit a 4 pack a day habit, I can quit my pack and a half day habit. Sure enough, it was the motivation I was looking for."
"If you can find licorice root, it looks like a twig, find it at an herbal store, chew on that when the cravings come. helps a little"
"I had a pack in my car for over 6 months, had very little anxiety knowing I could have a smoke and anytime but decided not to... Had I not had them I think I would have been worked up about not having them more than not smoking them"
"Just stfu and stop giving excuses, just quit cold turkey. I did.it worked better than having so much excuses."
I vaped for a while using smaller and smaller nicotine amounts. Eventually I was vaping at a zero level but was still vaping almost constantly so from there I started vaping some shitty flavors combine that with an old coil and I just didn’t want to taste it anymore. I was smoking at least a pack a day. And now I’ve been vape and smoke free for almost 2 years. 
"Keep trying. You actually do get better at it with practice. I 'quit' for roughly a year on two occasions, only to relapse for 2-3 years before trying again each time, but by the last time I quit (4+ years ago - I think I can safely say it's behind me for good, this time), I had a really good idea for what worked for me and what didn't. Even though I was probably *at least* as deeply physically addicted as ever, it was the easiest time by far.
I will say that one 'old saying' held very true for me, every time: The hardest parts are at '3's - 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months. That last one is a bitch, too; you'll think you've got it beat, but *something* will come up - some stress, or maybe a positive thing, like you're out drinking and a smoke sounds good - something will come up, and you'll think, ""Aww, I've got this thing licked! I proved to myself I could do it! I can have *just one*, it'll be fine!"" **Don't.**"
"Stop, don't quit. The word quit carries negative connotations. Count the money you save by not smoking. Count the days with a journal that you are free from smoking. Carry a container of cloves, put a clove stem in your mouth as a substitute taste. You go 8 hours every day without smoking(sleep). All from a book written by a hypnotist. Richard Lovelace i believe. I smoked 3 while reading the book. 30 years ago. Haven't had one since. I was smoking 2 and a half packs a day. Vantage blues, $1.25 a pack. What do they cost now?"
How in the heck does one find time to smoke 50 cigs a day?   Oh and they are about 8 bucks a pack here in usa.
"You have to want it. Finish that last pack and just don't buy another. Replace the habit, I try to drink water (or carbonated water for that extra bite). Everytime you think about buying a pack (or at least as often as you normally would buy one) put that money aside in either a savings account or a jar at home and watch the funds build. After that, buy yourself something nice. Repeat that last step. If you slip up, dont fall back into the spiral, I had a smoke while drunk on sunday, I'm not drinking this weekend so theres no chance I'm repeating that. Best of luck!
Edit: spelling."
"I found a book at the library that had the nicotine levels of just about every single type of cigarette.  The book suggested you smoke a certain type of cigarette for a month and then move to the next type with lower nicotine levels.  I'd say it took about a year to move from regular Camel cigarettes to Vantage Ultra Lights, as I went at my own pace.  There is brand with lower nicotine levels than that, but it was like smoking lettuce leaves and I couldn't stand it.  I then proceeded to use a pushpin to poke the smallest hole into the white paper near the butt.  After a month I would make the hole larger or make two smaller holes.  Although it took me a couple of years, it was a much enjoyable experience than going cold turkey.  EDIT: eventually I went cold turkey, but it wasn't nearly as hard as when I failed going cold turkey off Camels."
"Smoke free for 3 yrs. You have to WANT to quit.
I tried a bunch of times when i felt like i should quit but didn't really want to and still enjoyed smoking. Those arrempts are doomed to fail. When i really wanted to quit i just went cold turkey.
When i did quit the following helped
Chew gum when having cravings.
Look up a list of the health benefits/timeline of quitting. So after 2 days you can look and see an extra day means xyz to you blood pressure etc. It helps the feeling of achievement
Reward yourself. When you reach 1 day, 1 week etc treat yourself with the money you saved."
"Don't count the days. The first few times I quit, I would do the ""it's been X days without a cigarette"" count. I even had one of those apps that keeps count for a while. At some point, I'd break and buy a pack, then quit, restart the count, rinse, repeat. What I realized down the line that keeping count didn't actually keep me from smoking, instead it kept me aware of smoking. Because I was keeping count, I was still thinking about smoking even though I wasn't. So this one time I quit, I forget what but I was EXTREMELY busy with something and lost count, so I gave up counting. Now that I wasn't thinking about cigarettes, or my lack thereof, it was much easier to simply forget them entirely."
Taper off. Conscious effort. Make that final decision. It will be 5 years in March for me and I smoked for 15 years. 
"Get a job where you are treated like an adult.
When I worked fast food and when I was in the military, the only way to get a break sometimes was to go for a smoke. So that's what I did. 
After I got out and started working in a white collar office, I noticed that nobody was keeping track of my location or how often I take breaks. So now, I take breaks when I want to, and I don't have to smoke anymore. I quit smoking almost immediately."
I started at 18 when I was on a ship in the Navy.  Everyone got these smoke breaks and the rest of us kept working.  20 years of being a smoker is what I got for trying to skate!

"If it's a hand to mouth habit, why hit the vape? "
"Ok. Here's what I believe and worked for me. Quit 9-10 years ago.
1. Cold Turkey. Forget the ""I'll taper it off"" idea, and forget the gum. How many posts in here have you seen where the answer is Nicorette? Not many. The reason for this is that these ideas prolong the time period of required disciple. It takes nearly the same amount of self control to follow a rationing schedule as it does to just quit. The difference is, rationing takes twice (or more) the time. The longer the stretch required for self control, the higher likelihood of failure.
2. ""Do it for yourself"" - Bullshit. Unless your an athlete or have some other strong other physical motivation, this isn't likely to work either. There are people with holes in their throat that continue to smoke. Cancer. I put up with hacking up green shit to the point of puking every morning, constantly out of breath, smoking whatever half used cigarette I could find when I didn't have any fresh. Nasty shit - but, quite frankly, the usual. 
So, here's what worked, after countless times -
3. Do it for other people. In doing so, you'll do it for yourself. Read the post about the guy who quit because his wife was getting sick. People who had kids. Etc. The average Joe/Joan needs outside pressure to get it done.
       I was 24 and told my parents I'm quitting smoking, and moving in with them for a week. I knew a couple things - if I failed, they would know almost instantly from the smell. I also knew, they wouldn't laugh, or get mad, but they would be disappointed, and would always remember that failure. Making a bond about something with another person is extremely powerful for us humans, and most of us will fight like hell not to break it. Find a way to do that.
4. How it worked. The first 3-4 are miserable. No surprise. After about a week it's more or less tolerable, and after two weeks, I never thought about it again. It's not that long a time period broken down into hours. I would recommend not drinking for maybe a month, as booze and cigarettes complement each other. Just stick it out.
Good Luck"
"> ""Do it for yourself"" - Bullshit. Unless your an athlete or have some other strong other physical motivation, this isn't likely to work either.
I consider literally being a body a strong physical motivation. You didn't really provide an argument for why doing it for yourself is ""bullshit"". You just pointed out people who obviously don't care about themselves. Plenty of us quit for ourselves, first and foremost."
"Just stop smoking. Stop putting roadblocks up. You don't need tips. You need to just stop smoking. Quitting cold turkey sucks, I'll admit that. I did it and was just miserable for a while. But it's a small price to pay to not smell bad, be able to take a full breath and not shorten your own life expectancy repeatedly."
"Vape naysh y'all.
But it really did work for me so it's something to consider."
"Didn't work for me.  I gave it a fair shot and I generally enjoy it, but it never latched on like cigarettes ever did.  I tried smaller and bigger builds.  Currently using a drip-tip and I really enjoy using it...but it doesn't do it for me.
It seems like although it will help me power through a craving, it's VERY temporary.  And if I use it too much, my lungs feel like I'm drowning.  But it's so yummy "
just stop
[deleted]
"While stopping may be one of the hardest things you will ever do, it is also the hardest step.  Everything after that is cake."
"First, if you have a friend that smokes and wants to quit, quit together. My friend and I made a bet that the first one to smoke again, even a puff, owed the other $500. Neither of us have smoked since, about 4 years ago now.
Second, quit cold turkey. If you smoke more then a pack a day you should probably ween yourself off. Either way, don’t use nicorett gum or the patch or lozenges. Those would be just crutches. That will just decrease your chances of being able to quit.
Third, get involved with an online support group if that will help. Maybe if r/quitsmoking or r/stopsmoking are things, try those.
You may also put all of the cash that you would have spent on cigarettes into a jar, and overtime use it to buy yourself a nice gift or put it away in savings.
Good luck to you. It’s one of the best decisions of my life. I’ve saved so much money. I don’t smell terrible anymore. I am able I focus better."
I don't agree with the cold turkey. I would say replacement is easier but they should do what they are comfortable with.
"Make a conscious decision that you are now a non-smoker. It was 100% for me about having this mindset. You are not a smoker who has quit, or is quitting: you are a non-smoker, simple. I made sure that I did not touch a tobacco product for 3 weeks, and after that if I tried a cigarette because I craved it or missed it (when stressed, drinking or socialising) it tasted disgusting and further reiterated in my mind that I was a non-smoker. That was 12 years ago (I smoked for 7 years) and I've never picked up smoking again. "
This is the best advice I have seen itt
"I suggest quitting cold turkey.  Myself (quit 9 years ago) and the people I know who have quit for good have almost all quit cold turkey.  It seems like having a crutch (vape, gum, patches) inevitably leads back to smoking.
The first 2 weeks are going to be rough, but after that it gets a lot easier.  Exercising and being active helped me a lot.  Drinking just made me want a cigarette so I didn't drink for several months.  A year after I had no real temptation to smoke.  About 3 years after I couldn't (and still can't) stand the smell of cigarette smoke.  It's just really gross and I have no idea why I did it."
"Cigarette smoke, I agree, every time I smell it, my first thought is, “what the hell was I thinking?” Good cigar or pipe tobacco still smells good to me, though."
"Hey there. I started smoking stolen cigarettes from mom’s purse in 1986. I was up to a pack a day in 1990. I stopped for good 7 days, 12 hours, and 10 minutes ago. I haven’t cheated or even thought about it seriously since then. Get yourself an app to keep track of your time & money. Checking my time & money has become a little habit of its own. 
Here’s how you do it. You have to WANT to stop smoking. I’ve quit probably 20 or 30 times before but it never lasted for more than a few hours. I’d hide a few emergency cigarettes, bum them from someone - you get the idea. I never WANTED to stop. I loved smoking. I loved it. When I started you could still smoke on airplanes, for Pete’s sake. It’s gotten hard to smoke for a variety of reasons. I mean, even when you’re OUTSIDE people give you a hard time. Plus, I’ve dropped over $50,000 on ash, litter and making myself unhealthy. What’s crazy is that even after 28 years my body is healing remarkably quickly. 
If you don’t WANT to quit, don’t bother. You’ll find yourself somewhere that sells them or asking someone for one before you know it. I’m 7+ days in. I’m concentrating on how well I’m breathing & sleeping. That’s much better for me. "
Just don't smoke. Don't let excuses win.
"Easy as hell to quit if you buy a decent vaporiser. Not a crappy pen. 
I personally have a sigelei fuchai with a kylin tank, but any of the bigger vapes will do.
It still has nicotine and what not, but certainly better for you than smoking in the long run. You can reduce the amount of nicotine, or just stop altogether whenever you feel comfortable to."
"Y'know, I came in here specifically to see how far the guy advocating vaping got downvoted.
&#x200B;
It was the only thing that got me to put down Camels after a damn near 20 year old 2+ pack a day habit, literally within a month.
&#x200B;
Judgemental mf'ers need to go find a goddamn hobby.
&#x200B;
And cloudbro/vapenashe/teens doing it for tricks need to GTFO, you're making us responsible vapers look bad."
Did you use to feel pain in yourl lungs?
"Easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr. I watched the video. For some reason the video worked better for me than the book.
What drove me to search for ways to stop smoking is when I became a dad. I knew I had to, for them. "
"Do you have a link to the video?
"
"Surprisingly out of a handful of things I’ve quit smoking was by far the easiest to get out of, but also back into. It’s just a matter of staying conscious about it for me at least. "
"I don't smoke myself, but if you truly enjoy smoking, then it makes it very, very hard to quit. 
My father wants to quit for health reasons, but he's admitted that he actually enjoys smoking. 
Thankfully, he doesn't smoke that much, never has. Maybe 2-5 cigarettes a day."
"Quitting brought about (even more) migraines and exhaustion. So I switched to a vape and have used that to ease off. I still use it, but just because the motion is comforting. Not for the nicotine. It can be difficult, but when you realize how much easier it gets to breathe and the money you save, it begins to feel worth it."
Find what will really make you want to give up for me it was getting pregnant and using an e-cigarette I mixed up all the things so I didn’t know if I was getting nicotine or not and just kept adding more no no nicotine ones.
"I chew the cinnamon nicotene gum and it works, I also carry big red because I don't want to increase my nicotene intake like I did with vaping. I made it a year then went on a drinking and smoking bender in july/august. Now Im back to not smoking. "
Juul gang
"* don't buy tobacco
* quit joints too, vape your weed
* don't go out with smokers
* don't drink alcohol/coffee if you can't separate tobacco from them
* when you crave nicotine, take it as a game where you play with your brain asking for a cigaret, eat an apple, repeat yourself that you're stronger
* think about all the negative effects when you want a cigaret i.e. ecology, health, money aspects."
"I went to cones for the green. Nice halfway house for the first week or so, while still keeping the motivation of not longer smoking tobacco"
"Medication can help. I managed to quit a 2-pack a day habit almost 15 years ago. I used Zyban. I also had a great desire to quit and had to completely dig deep for willpower. It helped that I was deployed to Iraq at the time. I know it sounds nuts quitting smoking in a war zone but that actually made it a little easier. First it was sand storm season when I quit. I wasn't going to go outside in that shit just to smoke a cigarette. Second I knew that my then girlfriend (now wife) wasn't going to want to live with me if I smoked. And third: I was in a fucking war zone. Everyone was on edge and acted like a dick. So being an asshole suffering from the ""nic-fits"" didn't really make me stand out. Besides, I was assigned to a unit I wasn't a part of back in garrison in the states So what did I care if they thought I was an asshole once in a while? I never saw any of them after I rotated back home.
One thing I did every day that really helped was remind myself how long it was since I had a cigarette. And also remind myself that if I smoked even just one I would have to start over again. ""I haven't had a smoke in 5 days. But if I have one today tomorrow I'll have to say 'I haven't had a smoke in **ONE** day'. Fuck that""."
"I switched to vaping but had to quit that. People say vaping is the safer altetnative. I disagree. Both my wife and I are runners. We have smoked and ran, been smoke free and done it with vaping. Vaping and running was hard. Worse than smoking."
"After fifteen years of chimney life I went to doctor and asked for help quitting. The doctor said to read “The Easy Way to Quit Smoking” by Alan Carr. She said if I read it and was still smoking she would give me Chantix. 
Read it, followed the directions, and quit cold turkey with zero withdrawal symptoms. In fact, rather than withdrawal, I felt amazing. I attributed it to the fact that my brain was finally getting the correct amount of oxygen for the first time in years. 
I think the biggest thing about quitting is you have to be ready to. You have to be ready to be done with this thing. "
My wife used a e-cigarette(or whatever they are called) but filled it with a liquid that didn't have nicotine in it.
"Alan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. I was a 2 pack a day smoker, absolutely loved it, did the audiobook over a week, and on Friday I quit cold turkey, it's been well over a year now, and haven't had a cig since."
Acknowledge that you will always be a smoker. The urges will always happen from time to time no matter the years.
"That's not true, not for every one because I despise even the slightest smell of tobacco. "
"I really thought I wouldn’t be able to quit after 7 years of smoking. I tried to go cold turkey a million times and it didn’t work. But then I focused on “why” do I smoke. 
First, you have to actually want to quit. It helps if you don’t hang out with smokers, I’ll be honest. But even if you do, try to hang out in situations when they’re less likely to smoke (movies, out to dinner etc). 
Then you have to break down the habits/triggers that make you want to smoke, one by one. This is the only thing that worked for me. So my biggest “I need a cigarette” moments came:
-when I was drinking coffee 
-when I was writing 
-driving
-drinking (that’s the biggest one). 
So over the course of 2 years (it really took me that long 😭) I broke each of those habits one at a time. I would challenge myself to drive to work without a cig. Then challenge myself to drive home without one (always saying to myself that I could have one later if I want). 
Then the next day I would say “well, you didn’t smoke while driving yesterday, so you can probably do it again”
Did that with every major smoking trigger. 
The worst was trying to quit while drinking. There’s nothing I love more than a cigarette with a glass of wine. 
For that, I took my first vacation in a while (visiting my husband for a week in mexico) and left my cigarettes at home. I told myself I was just going to drink and hang out for one week without them. I could always smoke when I returned. Then, of course, when I returned, I told myself “hey. You didn’t smoke while drinking in Mexico, so you can drink without a cigarette here” 
A change of scenery was incredibly helpful - if just for a week. 
So now it’s been 4 months and I have no desire to smoke again. I’ll be honest, I tried one a month ago while hanging out with a friend and it just tasted gross. 
Sorry about the ramble, but that’s what worked for me!"
"Lollipops or dum-dums, whatever you want to call them. Get a big bag of them.
Every time you want a cigarette, have one of them instead. I always felt I could deal with the nicotine withdrawal, but I always wanted something in my hand and in my mouth (yeah yeah, I know how that sounds...).
The dum-dums helped with a ton with that. "
don't smoke
.
Halls. Lots of  Halls eucalyptus. They also work well for “munchie” suppression. 
3rd day is the worst 
"I smoked like it was a cure for cancer for 16yrs. First thing I did upon waking was light a cigarette, last thing I did at night was put one out. When I quit, I was at a minimum of a pack and a 1/2 to 2 packs a day if I went out after work.
During that 16yrs I tried so many times to quit but in the end what worked for me (I've been smoke free for years) is NOT changing any single part of my routine. When I had tried to quit in the past, I would stop drinking coffee, not go to bars with friends (drinking/partying made me smoke more), anything that I associated with smoking until I was passed the initial detox stage, but once I started drinking coffee and socializing more etc...it was still an immense trigger to smoke and eventually that is exactly what I'd end up doing, again. So the final time I changed NOTHING, the only thing I did differently was not smoke. It did make it tougher to begin with, but absolutely nothing became a smoke trigger for me. The one other thing I did was a 1/2 of a nicotine gum when I just couldn't take it any more. I was uber careful not to get addicted to them and only chewed when in absolute agony. These may or may not work for you, but something will bcs I fucking LOVED smoking (just didn't want to pay for it anymore) and if I can do it, you can too!! Good luck!!"
"Find a reason for yourself. A reason that you truly want to quit for. If you can't; forget about it and revisit when you can.
If you don't really *want* to quit, you won't."
"Combination of things for me. Vaping helped. But not the kind that tastes good. I used the 'tobacco' flavor and the vape looked like a cig and it seemed the closest to actual smoking. Never completely scratches the itch, but helps significantly. Also meeting and talking to smokers who had been doing it for decades helped. Just seeing them and hearing their stories made me know I never wanted to let myself get there. It helped give me the strength to keep away from cigs. I was a little over 6 years in when I quit and it was still very difficult to do so. Took 3 separate tries and always seemed to fall back into it either 3 weeks or 3 months in to quitting. Now it's been 4 years."
"Don't count the days you've gone with out a cigarette. It's too much pressure. Just go today without a cigarette. Then tomorrow just go without a cigarette. Repeat.
Also vaping really helped too. It curbed the craving for that one day you want to have a cigarette. 
Resolve and resolution brother!"
"Read ""Allen Carr's easy way to quit smoking"". Its basically magic. I smoked for over a decade, two packs a day. I tried cold turkey, the patch hypnosis, sometimes I could quit for months but would come back, sometimes I could cut it down but I had gotten to a point where I accepted I would never truly quit. Then I read the book and never smoked again, never had the urge to smoke, never had a single withdrawl symptom. Easiest thing I ever did, read the book and you wont smoke.
Every single day of my life since I think ""It feels great that I dont have to smoke today"". Its the best gift you will ever give yourself."
"So I've only been smoke-free for a week and 3 days, so I don't know how much advice I can give. That being said, I've been chewing nicotine gum. Takes the edge off and it's better than smoking. Good luck! "
"Patches helped me go from a pack a day to 0-5. From there, I had hernia sugery and just decided to quit. Was a month nicotine free on Wednesday. You can do it. "
"Change your habits, like a diet. Smokers smoke based more on patterns and habits than they realize. 
Vaping helps for cravings (get a cheap one, it's not a replacement for smoking).
And toothpicks. Good for those driving cravings and after meal cravings. 
It's been over a thousand days since I quit, and I still crave one every fucking day. Accepting that you will want to smoke for the rest of your life is another big part.  "
"Here's what I did: For several nights in a row, hell maybe even a few weeks, I would chain smoke just before bed until the point of feeling like i was about to puke. Then I got some nicotine gum and chewed way more than i was supposed to, again, I felt like I was going to puke. Did that until the two week supply was gone. I forced myself to associate smoking cigarettes with feeling like I was going to puke, so it was less enticing to pick the habit back up if I felt any urges. I did this roughly 10 years ago. I've smoked a few times since then when drinking with friends strictly in a social setting and I've never had any desire to pick the habit back up, even the act of smoking while drinking wasn't pleasurable, so it's been years since i've done that as well. This may not be your traditional method, but for me it worked."
"Don't give yourself ""time until x and then I quit"". I've done that 3 times and I managed like two weeks each time.
You have to just decide to quit, and do it right there and then. For me that was when I was running (I exercised for a 5k) and realised my performance was piss poor because my lungs were fucked after 3 years of smoking.
I decided to quit then, on the walk back home. And with some effort actually managed it."
"You will only quit when you are truly ready, then, and only then quit and never do it again."
Don't change your lifestyle at the same time. For me I took a week away then came back and did everything the same without the smokes. Aka still went out for cigarette brake.
"Kept getting tonsillitis. 
Figured I’d try not smoking anymore.
Stopped getting tonsillitis.
Haven’t felt the need to smoke since, because tonsillitis sucks and I guess I want to live longer Idk.
"
"I was a smoker for 9 years before quitting.
The most important thing is to make the decision to quit. You cant just ""kinda"" want to quit, you must really want it. 
I decided in November that I would have my last cigarette on the 1st of January and smoked normally until them. On the new years eve I even bought a pack and finished it the same night. Didn't smoke ever since.
It wasn't easy, especially the first week, but after 1 month I felt much better. 
It has been almost 3 years now and sometimes I still feel like having a smoke. When that happens I just try to distract myself.
EDIT: A word"
"Black peppercorn, take one every time you feel like a cig, worked for me :-)"
"You have to want to quit. I quit before for six years and have a little over four and half years this go around. Neither time would have been successful if I truly didn't want to quit, otherwise you're just wasting your time."
"I smoked a pack a day for a little over ten years. Every time I quit and failed, I tried to 'customize' the solution for me. I.e, use the gum or the patch most of the time, but not on weekends or stressful days. 
The successful quit was when I finally said ""im buying patches, in the strength they recommend, will not smoke at all, and it doesn't matter how uncomfortable it is or how expensive it is, I will continue until there are no more patches"".
Nicotine patches are uncomfortable and leave zitty, rashy patches. People don't talk about that part. Or that they cost more than cigarettes for less nicotine.
But in the end, it was shutting the fuck up, doing what the box said, and sticking to my guns that got me to quit. "
Avoid bars and other situations where you will drink alcohol around other smokers for the first month. It's the easiest place to get sucked back into smoking. 
You already quit. It's easy to quit. The hard thing is to not start again.
Quit at the same time as my wife and we were both too stubborn to be the first one to go back
Ecig
"In all honesty it is the nicotine dosage you are use to. Vapes/e-cigarettes let you control your dosage and you can decrease it gradually over time. Then when your down to 3mg or less, you start seeing less of a dependence on it. Eventually I just stopped all together within a year. Still vape during the cold months though, vape and coffee in the morning (used to be cig and coffee). Honestly it changed everything. "
"Make quitting your new habit. Keep trying, you will fail many times, but keep at it and it’ll get easier. Also, condition yourself to be disgusted by cigarettes. If someone’s smoking on the street take a wide path around them like it makes you sick. Cringe if you see butts on the ground. Get used to seeing cigarettes as a revolting, nauseating, poisonous turd candle. "
"Keep on trying and be introspective about why you tricked yourself to think that it was fine for you to start again. If you can come to the realization that your brain always keeps a ""valid"" reason to come back to it at some point and crush those though you will have a greater chance of success. Also, multiple attempts makes you better at dealing with the psychological withdrawal."
"I quit in 2008. I made it a game. I really cared about the streak more than I cared about the health improvements. Eventually, I cared about the health improvements more. I always heard of you can make it 3 days, you can quit.  So I made it to 3. Then 4,5,6,7 and so on.  You get to a certain point where you might want a cigarette, but that would mean your streak is over and you have to start over.  I had dreams where I would smoke and wake up temporarily upset, but realize it was a dream and my streak was still in tact. Anyone can quit and everyone should quit. 
I also had some motivation to get it started.  My now wife, then friend, said it was gross. Also, you’re paying some mega corporation to poison yourself.  People are getting rich off of you fucking your shit up.  That doesn’t seem right. "
as soon as I realized how disgusting my cough was I knew i needed to stop. Coughing up all the nasty black mucus from your lungs in the months after quitting was enough to convince me to never go back. 
I got TB. They get really cranky in the respiratory clinic when you rock in for your TB treatment smelling of cigarettes.
"You have to want it...
you cant quit for someone else, You have to want to quit
How did i quit? I delayed before my next smoke, Instead of having one now, lets rather smoke in 30minutes. When the 30minutes was up, let's delay it again..
about 10 years later, i still waiting "
"Your mind has a crazy ability to convince you of things.  On Friday, it will try to convince you that you should really just buy a pack and wait until Monday to quit.  On Monday, it will assure you that it makes the most sense to wait until the weekend to quit, so you should just go buy a pack.  You need to be committed to telling your mind to fuck right off with that."
"Everyone can quit for just one day right? Do that everyday. Wake up and quit for the day, not forever cause that’s stressful. Just one day and repeat. This has worked for me for 2 and a half years. "
Persistent is key. Tried for 2 years and it eventually worked. 
"Quit when my ex was pregnant. Because I didn't want the baby to be around smoke and figured I'd get a jump start on it. 
&#x200B;
So that's my advice. Have a baby. :p "
"For me, the first 3 days were the hardest. I'd say it peaked on day 3, with shakes and irritability. You really have to want to quit. I quit multiple times, but if I got stressed, I'd revert back to it again. It's when I finally wanted to quit, that I had success. I used nicorette gum at first, and changing my routine up to take away the triggers. It's not easy, and I still have moments where I want one, but I feel so much better now. I never realized how hard it was to breathe when I got sick, or how much I wheezed when I laughed. "
Read Allan Carr’s easy way to quit smoking. Worked for everybody I know who read it and quit.
"I'd say isolation. For me, the best thing was to sleep off the haze of not smoking. It was foggy brained and angry. I slept a lot. Around the 30th day I came home and was like ""Cool! I can do something and not want to destroy it!"" 
Also, mini nicotine lozenges. If you don't want to be a cave dweller for a month to get past the bad stages, level out with these. "
"Every day you don't at least try is another day you won't quit. It's not a lot of fun, but it's not impossible either. When you want a cigarette, put it off. Postpone it as long as you can every time. Try to take your mind away from it by thinking about something else. 
Idk, some people use gum or patches. "
"Cold turkey is the only way. (There is always a way to justify the next ""one."") Remind yourself about all the money your saving and extra years you're adding to your life. "
"I did nicotine gum and patches at the same time. I would dip during the day and smoke on work breaks and weekends. Eventually got off the pitches and switched to regular gum. I been good for over 2 years now. I do believe everyone will need their own methods to quit, every person is different."
"dont buy them, 
Dont go where people are smoking, 
Do not meet up with people who smoke, because they will ply you with freebies and shame you into smoking, because addicts hate people who have the strength to quit, 
change you life style, your habbits, bars, restaurants, office break areas, old habbits are kicked into being active by places, people, smells and memories.
&#x200B;
Drop and do 10 (20 if you are fit) every time you feel that you are going to say yes, no matter where you are, everyone will ask what the hell you are doing and you can openly say, ""I was going to take a  smoke, but now I know I can say no"" re-enforce your will power."
Quit cold turkey. The first week will be tough but it should get better. Just focus on your goal. 
"Just realizing how bad your breath smells after smoking throughout the day does miracles, really! I used to think that people who hate cigarette odour are just ""normies"". Once I stopped smoking for a few weeks, I suddenly realized that people who smoke smell bad, like  shit-equivalent bad.  Realizing that that's how non smokers perceive me, it was much easier not to return smoking.
 Also, realizing that out of 10 cigs I've smoked, maybe 1 made me feel somewhat good, while the other 9 did just absolutely nothing for my mood. 
"
"I've been cigarette-free for 12 days now so I'm hardly an expert but I've quit a few times before and feel like I'm doing it right this time. I bought a fairly expensive vape as an investment towards staying smoke free. I also use tobacco flavoured vape juice so its a similar taste. I also use nicotine gum for that 'after-meal' craving, which really works. Overall, I'd say the first 3 days are the hardest. You'll feel a little spacey as your body adjusts to the lack of cigs but I personally feel more grossed out by cigarettes the longer I don't smoke."
"Cold turkey is the only way.  I tried every other cessation device and all that does is prolong the nicotine addiction/withdrawal.  Embrace the fact you’re going to be short-tempered and lacking a filter for a time.  Certainly throw in some exercise and healthy snacks, lots of water, and breathing exercise.
You also have to really want to quit.   By the time I finally quit for real I genuinely wanted to.  
Whyquit.com was also really helpful for me, as were the discussion forums.  "
"Cold turkey worked for you and my grandparents. I don’t know anyone else who was able to just quit. I’ve tried a few times, failed because I genuinely don’t want to quit smoking. I enjoy it, I enjoy the actions you make while smoking. The hard part for me isn’t really not smoking, it’s not doing the things I do while smoking. "
"Don't give up. The average successful quitter made seven previous unsuccessful attempts.
Have a plan. You will get past the symptoms of physical addiction in a few days, but you need a plan to deal with the habitual and psychological symptoms. 
To break the habit change whatever you do that you currently associate with smoking. Smoke with coffee? Start drinking tea. Take smoke breaks at work? Take a walk break instead. You get the idea.
The psychological addition is what gets dooms most quit attempts. Many people self soothe with tobacco, so when the shit hits the fan they return to what they know will make them feel better. The old cliche of someone buying a pack of cigarettes for the first time in years after some traumatic life event is actually quite accurate. The way to handle it is to realize that traumatic (and not-so-traumatic, but nonetheless troubling) life events occur and to have a plan on what you will do when the craving hits.
And don't give up."
"Get rid of **everything** related to smoking.  Lighters, ashtrays, matches, cases, you name it.  Then, thoroughly clean your house, all your clothes, your furniture, and your vehicle's interior.  Don't be stingy with the fabric freshener spray.
If you wear hats, clean those, too.  Once you've stopped smoking for a few days, you'll be very aware of any residual smoke smell, and it can be very tempting, especially during your daily routine.  
When you quit, ***QUIT***.  No half-measures."
"I used an app, lots of exercise, prunes and a mild laxative. My main reason for picking up a cig after attempting to quit was the lack of peristalsis and fear of weight gain. At 3 weeks, i’m over the hump and think that bodily functions are also getting back to “normal”. Have no desire for a cig and can even sit with someone as they smoke and not be tempted."
Just go to a doctor and get Chantix. You'll be done smoking in a month.
"This worked for me,  over 10 years cig free. "
One day at a time. You’re going to want one everyday at some time. For the first 6 months. After the first 2 weeks It gets a lil easier everyday. 
"Simply read 'Alan Carr's Stop Smoking'
Talk to you about the actual act, the science and removes the FEAR."
"Quit cold turkey. Then alter how you think about it. You don’t need to be strong willed. You don’t need to think “I can resist this urge”. 
Instead, whenever you think about smoking allow yourself to feel a sense of relief. Think “oh man, it’s nice that I don’t have to worry about that anymore. I don’t have to bother going outside, I don’t have to worry about how I smell. This is great!” 
This mental trick turns quitting from a battle into a pleasure. Sounds dumb maybe but it really worked for me. "
I’m only three weeks at this point but I can already see a nice savings in the bank considering I was buying a pack a day.  Truthfully I quit a zillion times and this particular time was because I was so broke and didn’t want to charge cigs anymore.  Sucked it up.  Keep ignoring the cravings. Haven’t been to smoking bars  or really drank that much at all honestly since thy go hand in hand. 
Juul
The trick is to have a cigarette and then never have another one again until you die.
"Both my parents quit cold turkey about ten years ago after about 40 years of smoking for my mom and 50ish for my dad. What they did is  sit down and do the math on how much money they were spending on cigarettes per month. They were both pack+ per day smokers, so it ended up being about 1000 a month. My mom told my dad that they were smoking what they had left and then were done. It worked, although my dad was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer about 9 months later."
"Mine was almost purely financial. I didn’t have a lot of money to save and use for hobbies and toys after bills. I did the math, and at $11 for my (former) brand, times 2 packs a day, it something like $600 dollars a month is saved. Now, I’ve reigned my spending back in and am trying to upgrade my overall quality of life. "
"Du it cold turkey, fuck nicotine patches,cum,spray vapes whatever..just quit.
Helpfull for the cravings is to do something orally, have a mint, chew ona toothpick,have a piecve of fruit.. something to take your mind of the craving, they wont take long to go away.
and nr 1 tip, It´s much much easyer then you think, it´s all in your head anyway so just put your mind to it.
"
"Everyone’s different, but here’s what worked for me: 
1. First, I cut back. This not only reduced my addiction, but also reduced the frequency of habit. 
2. When you officially quit, have a non-tobacco source of nicotine available. I had some nicotine patches even though I wasn’t doing the whole patch “program” where you use them to slowly taper off. I ended up using two patches total, at the lowest dose they came in, at moments of “fuck this, I feel like shit and want a cigarette!” Once the symptoms wore off and I was past that “fuck this” moment, I removed the patch. It just kept me from choosing a cigarette to satisfy my addiction. 
3. I stayed away from smoke and smokers for a while to avoid temptation. 
4. Over the next few years, I didn’t view it as a failure or as a reversion back to being Smoker with a capital S if I had a cigarette or two. I had handful of such “slips” while out for a night of drinking, but I just didn’t allow myself to view that as, “Welp, I guess I’m smoking again, then.” I just woke up the next day still thinking of myself as a non-smoker and went on with life. (That said, I also didn’t let myself start thinking I could  “smoke socially.” That’s how I became a Smoker with a capital S the first time!) 
"
"Just fucking do it. No excuses. No ""cutting down"".
You're either smoking or you're not smoking. ""Quitting smoking"" is a delusion, you're still smoking. 
Oh, and if you find yourself relapsing after that one cigarette with your night of drinking, then quit drinking and adapt the ""never again, policy."
"This may or may not work for people, but it did for me. Sometimes you don't crave the smoke, but having something in your mouth instead. Which I why I took up chewing on toothpicks. Haven't picked up a smoke in 2 years."
This is the one that got me. Write an honest list of pros and cons. Two weeks of a struggle is worth it for the rest of your life. Also I actually wanted to quit.
"You really have to want to quit. Can't just be on the fence about it. You have to commit, fully.
Was a heavy smoker for almost 20 years and tried many different methods to try to quit. The patch is ultimately what kept me going strong. I used to have extreme cravings when trying cold turkey, the patch almost completely alleviated all the nicotine withdrawal symptoms.
Going to the gym helped as well as it let me focus my energy on something else and distracted me from any small cravings that would sneak by the patch. But, discipline is what is going to clench the deal for you here."
just dont smoke my man
"This will probably sound like bad advice, but this is what worked for me after trying vaping, Chantix (good for those who it works for, but Jesus it had some horrible affects on me), the patch, and gum.
Like a lot of people, I went cold turkey but unlike previous attempts I instead hit my vices harder than I normally would. I relished in the pain of cravings after eating. I drank more knowing that I'd like to eventually drink and not smoke. I hung out around smokers still. 
The idea was that I had heard a lot of people have cravings years after quitting due to certain triggers. I wanted to reset my triggers. By resetting those triggers to not be associated with smoking anymore, it made quitting long-term easier. 
Now, I'll say that the first week this way was way harder than any other way, but it was pretty smooth sailing after like 2 weeks. I've been smoke free for over two years and unlike many I absolutely do not have any cravings to smoke. "
"'Quitting forever and ever' was a very stressful thought for me. 
What worked was to not smoke for 24h. If I was going to smoke after that 24h, so be it.
Tl;DR: One day at a time."
"This is probably going to be downvoted to all hell but what helped me years ago was just making a conscious decision that I'm not a smoker anymore. I had tried quitting a few times (even tried those make cigs taste like shit pills) but always seemed to crack and go back to it. By approaching it with the ""I'm trying to quit"" mentality you give yourself the possibility of failing to quit, but once I made the conscious decision that ""I don't smoke anymore"" it stuck. I did still get cravings but whenever any of my friends offered me a smoke I just said ""nah, I don't smoke anymore."""
"Honestly, I never had a hard time quitting cold turkey, even when I got up to a pack a day. What would set me back is I always started smoking again while drinking. So in order to keep the habit gone, I stopped drinking for like two or three months because the temptation was too strong and my willpower was nonexistent when drunk.
I guess my advice is, if you have something you STRONGLY associate smoking with, quit it too if possible for awhile until you break that association, then resume it. If it's something you cannot quit, such as you smoke while driving to/from work, have a replacement. My brother-in-law packed a little bag of snacks to eat on his car ride home instead of smoking. 
Best wishes getting tobacco free! I still get urges sometimes but it's been 5 years for me, so I rarely think about actually giving into those urges anymore. "
"Be drunk for 3 days. When you want to smoke.... drink. 
3 days too drunk/sleep/hungover to smoke. Then physical addiction is over.
The rest is habbit.
And then you are stubborn enough to not give in to something silly and weak as just a mental habit... 
Dont let your mind play that trick on you.
And then for over 2 years have super realistic dreams of smoking a cig......"
Cold turkey is the only sustainable option
"Don't make a big deal out of it. Just stop. 
I found every time I tried and I told everyone that I was quitting, then people kept questioning me about it and asking how it's going etc.
Once I just stopped smoking without telling everyone and just pretended that I never smoked, I just stopped. Probably won't be as easy for everyone, but it certainly worked for me."
"First and foremost, you have to be ready.  Don't just think you're ready. No fallback plan.  You have to be prepared to quit.  Give yourself goals to meet.  They don't have to be huge goals.  If you always have a smoke after dinner, give that one up. 
Myself, I used vaping as a tool.  This was about 4 years ago, before it got huge and ""showy"".  As soon as I got my e-cig, that was it for buying smokes. It came with a small bottle of the juice. I think it was 24mg or 2.4% nicotine.  Each time my bottle was empty, which took about 2 weeks, I cut the nicotine in half.  By the time I got to 0%, I was elated. At that point, on my second day of the 0% juice, I asked myself why I'm even doing it. I put it down and never picked it up again.  My wife was doing the same thing, and put hers down 2 weeks after me. 
If you're trying to quit, don't make it big news. Don't do it for the glory. Do it for you and if you have kids, do it for them. Hell, if I could do it, anybody can! "
"You have to want to quit, then you quit.  It isn't easier or harder than that.  I got home one day from work I smoked 1.5 packs a day, and my kid wanted a hug and Kiss, and I said no I had to wash first, she looked devastated.  Last time I smoked."
"Get a coronary calcium heart scan. Look at the results with your doctor. Realize that what you're viewing is in large part due to the inflammation that smoking causes throughout your body. Realize that what you are viewing is similar to viewing the gun that will likely kill you one day.
Your face then feels hot, you have a horrific sinking feeling in your gut as it dawns on you that you are the one who loaded that gun. 
I put them down that afternoon, cold turkey, after 36 years. Quit, quit now."
"I bought a JUUL.  Started replacing cigarettes with vaping.  After two weeks, am exclusively using JUUL .  It's only been a week but I went to gas station to buy pods and had no desire to buy a pack.
I have a long road ahead of me but I'm fighting for my life."
"Late to the party here, but I quit cold turkey after smoking for 15 years. I smoked all but the last cigarette in my pack, and then kept that pack on me for a few months. Every time I wanted a smoke, I would take out that last cigarette and think about it. Finally ended up throwing it away. Haven’t smoked in almost 4 years now! "
Just woke up and didnt light one. Havent smoked in 3 months
"Improve other aspects of your health (diet, exercise, sleep) and the negative effects of smoking will be more noticeable. It’s hard to keep smoking when you can feel it restricting your breathing, speeding up your heart, etc. 
CBD vapes are also great. Doesn’t give you a head rush like nicotine vapes but helps with anxiety and irritation. "
Get old. I went from a casual smoker to hating it just by the simple fact of getting migraine like hangovers every monring after I had even 1 smoke the night before. Now I can't even stand to be in smoky bars. 
"After 10 years of a pack a day smoking, I can happily say that as of today, I am 10 days smoke free. The first 4-5 days are the worst, and I chewed the shit out of nicotine gum. After that, cravings subside and I replace every other piece of nicotine gum with dentyne ice, and now I just chew the dentyne. The cravings never fully go away, you just don't notice them as much, and are easier to ""shrug"" off. 
The biggest factor for me though, is will power. If you don't truly want to quit, you won't. You absolutely need the drive and motivation to plow through those first few shitty days."
"I quit cold turkey but my appetite went up and I basically ate every bit of food I saw to distract me.
This happened for a few weeks
This does work but obviously comes with the price of gaining pounds.
 
I guess my point is find something else to distract you from the urge to smoke.
"
"Cold turkey, and try to enjoy the pain of withdrawals,tenis ball technique,cold showers "
Nicotine patches work good
"Don't announce that you are quitting, just stop. I did it cold turkey with half a pack still in my center console. I left the pack there 4 years ago."
"I switched to a vape and then used the patches. It wasn’t a magic cure but it really does help the cravings, just take it off when you sleep cuz man it’ll fuck up your dreams. 
I don’t like gum and mints, so I would practice my singing instead, because then it forced me to think about the song. Took my mind off it and was good practice. 
Any non stressful hobby is good. I used to play league of legends and would always smoke when it made me mad, and other things too. Quitting those stressful things reduced my cravings since it was how I coped with them. "
Vaping then weaning off 
"The first week is HARD and takes grit (and lots of sunflower seeds). After that it gets much easier. Chew lots of whitener gum, keep sunflower seeds in your car at ALL times and drink tons of water. Good luck!"
"Just do it.  You have to remind yourself that you don't ""need"" that cigarette.  The cravings will pass if you keep yourself occupied with something else and breaking the relationship that cigarette has to certain activities.  Smoking is more of a habit that gives you something to do more than anything else.  Once you break the habit of relating smoking to going out with friends/break time at work/having a beer/driving ect it became very easy to quit."
"When you feel like having a smoke, drink a glass of water"
Just stop.  Thinking about it makes it worse.
"You've got to want it. No, not kind of, not feel like you have to, you have to viscerally, deeply WANT to stop smoking.
(Hopefully, it won't be a health scare that makes you want to quit, like it was for me. Thought I might lose my leg. Scared the living hell out of me. ... Finally quit two weeks later. Heh.)"
"Just quit. Go cold turkey. If you need some sort of help, replace smoking with something else. Eating fruits worked for me. "
Just don't tell anyone you are quitting. Puts unnecessary pressure on yourself and when you have moments of weakness you feel defeated and worse about yourself. Just make the conscious decision to quit and keep it to yourself. 
" Several points:
  
1.) Create new habits. I used to enjoy a cigarette after work every day on my balcony. Of course I also smoked in between, but just going on my balcony made me lust after a cigarette. I used to buy some (non-alcoholic) beer or special lemonade as a treat.
&#x200B;
2.) Pro and Contra Lists. Many non-smokers (who possibly never smoked) don't seem to understand why people would smoke. It's expensive, it's unhealthy, it smells! Write down whatever is annoying about smoking to you. 
While all of these points are true, it would be delusional to say that there are no other positive things about smoking.
&#x200B;
In my case, for example, I liked several things about it. It was my excuse to take a break several times a day, especially at work: So I watched out that I would still take some small breaks in between, because I did not want to associate smoke-free with harder work.
I used to smoke in stressful situations. I used deep breathing techniques and mindfullness.
In ""positive"" situations where smoking was my treat, I was looking for other treats (sweets, gum, a nice smelling candle, small things like that).
&#x200B;
Honor the positive things about smoking. Try to find other ways to get ""the good things"". And if you fall back and have a cigarette, don't treat it as a failure. It's part of recovery to have set-backs. Just start new. Focus on your list. What do you want in life, why do you want to quit, what helps to feel better.
&#x200B;
3.) Avoid smoking areas. This was big for me, personally, because surrounded by smokers was much, much harder to resist the urge.
Remember that physical addiction is not your biggest enemy- the psychological one is. Don't try to reason 'that it's stupid' and ignore it blindly. Try to make a decision to be smoke-free. If you relapse, decide it again. It's hard. It can stay hard. That's okay. Good luck!"
"Not me but my Grammie. I was 6 years d in the bath at my Grammies house. She went outside for just a few minutes to smoke, and when she came back I was drowning. She saved me and then quit smoking from then on. Unfortunately she died when I was 18 from COPD among other health problems, but I admire her for taking the event seriously enough to quit that moment.  "
"When I was quitting someone told me that the craving for a cigarette only lasts as long as it takes to smoke a cigarette. If you get the craving and can hang tough for 5 minutes, the craving will generally pass. At least until the next time your body wants one.
You have to ride out one craving at a time. One day at a time. And mentally prepare yourself for a long few months. "
I vaped and gradually lowered the nicotine strength in my liquids until I was on 0% nicotine and then one day I realised I hadn't vaped all day because I had no cravings so i quit that as well.
"Two things I learned after trying a million times and the last time it finally taking for good, hopefully: 
1. It takes awhile to get over it. If you smoked for 20 years you don’t get over it in a week. It took a good year to really feel like I was getting past it. 
2. And I learned this the last time I quit and it’s worked so far all there years, I can’t slip back to it even once. No cigar while playing golf. No hit of a friends cigarette outside the bar late. Because that’s what always tripped me up before. Stay vigilant. "
"Gonna get buried now but honestly, cold turkey was the easiest way. I tried patches, the inhalers and vaping but the best way is to just go cold turkey and fight through it. Any other way you end up transferring your addiction to somewhere else, when my brother tried to quit he ended up addicted to dr pepper of all things. Vaping is a decent way of doing it if you still want to go through the motions but doing it in a hopefully safer manner. "
"First you have to really want to quit. Doesn't matter the reason but from the bottom of your heart you need to want to quit.
Second you need to realize that you're an addict. And it's just like quitting any other drug. It's a bit easier because you don't have actual pangs that hurt.  It's a bit harder because smoking is everywhere.
Cutting down never worked for me. It's because when you cut down, you wait for those times when you can have that precious cigarette. Stop romanticizing smoking.
I read the book everybody's talking about. But I think it only helped because I wanted it to. And the hardest part was not quitting, it was staying clean. 
You have to get rid of it from your routine. For me the hardest was when I had to wait for something. Cigarette always helped with passing time. Now it's reddit. 
Now sometimes when it gets hard you need to remind yourself why you're better now. And why was it horrible to smoke. For me it's all the times I wanted a cigarette so bad, I couldn't enjoy the activity I was doing. Because in many activities you can't smoke. But if you want to, that's the only thing you think about. So whenever I think that maybe want just one cigarette,  I try to remember that feeling. Because if I take one, I will probably start again."
I quit smoking once. Worst day ever 
Don't start
"Giving up is easy, its hard to keep at it. Distance yourself from the other smokers for a week or two and just quit. It won’t work unless you see the damage it is causing to you. Once you see the physical damage on your own body is when you really need the feel to stop. "
"Switched to Cuban handrolled cigarillos. Robust smoke. Never fully inhaled. 
The nicotine buzz comes on slower than tobacco, making them less addictive. Smoked 1-3 per day for a few weeks, then stopped. 
Still smoke cigars on special occasions but never cigarettes "

"I recommend people look into the use of LSD. Probably more effective than any method I've tried. This varies per person though, as some people turn into chainsmokers while on acid."
"I never felt weening off worked, I just stopped, I ate a lot of lifesaver mints and a big problem I had was a problem with my hands, your hands get into the habit of smoking also, so I had to keep them busy, at the time I would play a lot of video games and anything else to keep them busy. "
"Get an eCig with enough juice and batteries to make sure you always have a vape handy.  Treat it like a diabetic kit, meaning if you forget it at home, you turn the fuck around and go get it, no matter what.  
Never put yourself in a position where you can justify grabbing smokes, because you will.  Smokes are WAY easier to get your hands and they cost less than having to buy a backup battery or bottle of juice on the fly.  Be smart. Have some discipline.  Remember why you want to quit smoking.  
Throw your cigarettes away and don't buy more.  
After about 90 days start stepping down your ejuice nicotine level until you're evdntually vaping at 0mg.  It's perfectly okay if it takes a couple of years to get there.  I guarantee that once you are vaping at 0mg you'll question why the hell you're vaping at all.  
Oh, and don't become one of those douchy vape asswads.  It's a nicotine delivery system, nothing more."
"I curved my habit by smoking lots of weed.

"Start exercising, start keeping track of exactly how much money you're saving by not smoking, and find a different way to occupy your hands in times where you'd normally smoke. "
"A big part for me was coming to terms with the fact that you’re addicted to it and won’t be able to eventually be a “just occasionally” user.  You’ve gotta accept that your last smoke really will be your last and go with it from there.
Doing it while also making some other sort of routine change helps too, like if you’re moving or changing jobs, good time to do it.  Or just switch things up enough to remove some of your daily triggers.  Maybe start a new fitness plan, or bring lunch to work instead of going out.  Whatever you can do to cut out those “I always smoke after _____” moments."
"I just stopped, same as my father...
Stop picking up the goddamn cigarette and lighting it, that’s literally all it takes.
I also love the “it reduces my stress” no, no it doesn’t stop lying to yourself."
"YMMV but here is what I did.  Waited for a long weekend.  And locked myself inside my house for the entire time.  Announced to everyone I lived with ahead of time what was happening.  And asked for patience.  After day 3 it got easier.  
I'm now 8 years nicotine free.  However I still crave it. Every day I want one. But the cravings are different, easily subsided by changing my thoughts.  Rather than it consuming them.  Everything that used to be a trigger still is.  Every drink, every car ride, every meal.  But I just think about anything else and it goes away easily.  Some days are easier than others. But overall it was a good move. "
"I tapered off the amount per week and used life changes to not include smoking in them.
e.g. figure out how many cigarettes you smoke per week and cut down by 5 each week going forward. The slow decrease isn't going to drive you nuts but you can at least get used to less and less.
Life changes are a good opportunity to develop new habits. I got a new car and decided i wouldn't smoke in it, as much as I loved smoking and driving, I was able to consciously avoid it. Cut my amount per day down a lot right there.
When I started dating my now wife, I made a promise not to smoke around her - was open about my habit and she understood and appreciated that I would refrain from doing it when we were together. Ended up smoking even less when we moved in together because she was around a lot more often!
Getting a new job and not hanging out with the smokers is huge too. Developing a ""oh it's 10am, better go for a smoke"" routine at work is very hard to change.
If you can just use all the changes life throws you to develop healthier routines that don't involve smoking."

"Cold turkey is the only effective way to go. Can't ween yourself off.
And you have to actually WANT to quit. Quitting bc someone else wants you to, or quitting because you kind of think you should won't work."
"Learn to find the smell disgusting. What helped for me was one night of drinking where I smoked a stupid amount of darts in one go. Eventually I found them gross. Woke up with that smell on my hand and decided enough was enough. Got on the vape to help with the oral fixation. Occasionally I’ll have one, by the time I’m half way done I feel gross and remember why I stopped buying them fuckers. "
Wellbutrin. Suppressed the urges and let me wean off. 
Both of my parents stopped smoking twice in their lives. It really takes a positive mindset. You need to be disciplined and determined to quit. Make a goal and strive for it. Find another outing to replace smoking like reading or exercise.
"For me vaping is doing the trick and saving my life. 
But don't just go into a store and get whatever they try to push on you.
Do extensive research on devices and their function and get something you might enjoy. 
Also ask Vapers for advice on devices. Try to find someone willing to take some time and explain whats up. 
Many vapers(me 2) have their recommended devices for smokers.
And they are not trying to sell you anything like the store clerk.
Also don't bother to much with the looks of the device. If your a flashy person go flashy. But the looks off the device don't say much about whether you'll like the important part. The vaping.
I think it's also the way to go if you don't want to use anything anymore. In my experience and that of other vapers/exvapers
it is much easier to quit vaping or to not vape for some time than it is to quit smoking. Either by just stopping or first lowering your nicotine dose. And you can do the latter without substracting from the vape experience.
I am not certain why that is. I attribute this to some of the other thousands of chemicals that are in cigarette smoke.

"What worked for me was honestly that I got to a point where I hated smoking. 
In terms of little things that helped with cravings and stuff, I found that exercise was a huge help in general, and for dealing with cravings on the spot I'd down a super cold glass of water really fast or eat some chocolate. 
I sort of exchanged my most habitual smokes with other things. I swapped my morning smoke for a brisk walk. Swapped my after lunch smoke for dark chocolate. Swapped my after work smoke for a jog. My after dinner smoke was the toughest, but I would push through it with a tall glass of ice cold water and deep breathing. "
"If you are serious about quitting, take a week off work when you can. Wait til your next week off from school or whatever. Smoke all your tobacco leading up to it. Smoke til your sick of them, and when you have none left, don't buy more. 3 days in you feel like shit. 5 days in it's out of your system, then it's just the habit. 
Doesn't matter if you do nothing productive that week. Find a series to binge. Exercise. Find no excuse to go to any shops. Take the money you would have spent on it and save it. Buy food before the weeks starts, find something delicious and healthy to cook. Challenge yourself in the kitchen. 
By the end of the week, you don't crave nicotine. You want to go outside for a cigarette. There is a difference. Week 2, go back to work. This is the hard part because you're used to taking smoke breaks, or smoking during your break. You also have access to people who will give you a cigarette. 
You can't let them give you one. You've just gone a week without. The habit isn't broken and it's up to you to not go back. Think of the reason why you quit. It's all psychological. You have suffered the withdrawal effects. You have suffered. Don't allow yourself to suffer when you next decide to quit. You deserve to be healthy. You've got this. "
"First you have to actually *want* to quit. If you don't really want to it's going to be nearly impossible. The temptations are always there even after you have been smoke free for years.
Next, you probably have your routine. Do you light up after a meal? When you get in the car? When you first wake up? When you drink? Choose one of your patterns and drop it. I got a new car and so I told myself I wouldn't smoke in it. Eventually I cut out like 5-10 smokes a day since a majority took place on my way to and from places.
Then I cut out after meals. Instead I'd brush and floss my teeth so my breath would be fresh. Eventually my brain rewrote the craving to the urge to brush or chew gum.
Then I picked up working out. I'd go running or lift weights. That extra energy and motivation from quitting made me feeling better about my body and my health. 
I've been smoke free for almost 2 years now. But almost every time I'm out with friends who are still smokers, I still get the urge to bum one. Whenever I do though...I just think how far I've come and what a shame it would be to fall backwards."
"It helps to have a reason other than ""it's healthier"", because smokers obviously know its unhealthy and they smoke anyways.
I didn't want to get rejected by women in case smoking was a deal-breaker... but it turns out they are quite adept at finding other reasons."

"I’m late to the party but I hope OP sees this. My university had a real tobacco products problem and so they started offering free classes to help people quit (in addition to free gum and patches) and, while it still took me a few attempts to successfully quit smoking and dipping when I ultimately did quit, the stuff I learned in that class was invaluable. It’s simple, but useful. 
1) identify your triggers. All smokers have habits for their use like any addict. For most of us they are things like getting in the car to drive, we light up. Finish a meal, we light up. Get done with work, we light up etc. You have to identify your triggers and voice them in your own head (just to say you basically need to admit “I know x is a trigger for me to smoke”) that way it becomes easier not to let that action trigger your habit. You start telling yourself, “I know I’m getting in the car in 15, but I’m not going to let that interfere with NOT smoking today. 
2) don’t smoke while using the patch or gum. It’s medically very dangerous for you, but those tools also take some of the burden/responsibility for quitting off of you. You can say “oh man, I’d love to smoke but I put my patch on. Oh well, I don’t even have the choice today. 
3) it is an addiction, and some experts argue it is one of the most profoundly addictive substances. Just because you aren’t stealing from people to support your “habit” doesn’t mean that your brain is on your side, it’s not. Your brain is actively trying to get that sweet, sweet, stinky nicotine like Sméagol trying to get his precious back. Help take your brain out of the equation by planning ahead. Address your triggers, set yourself up for success, and you can free yourself from having to internally debate “should I smoke today”. You will start waking up thinking “not today, Satan. Not today...”
4) accept that you will most likely fail a few times. It can be days between smokes, or it could be years. We don’t really rid ourselves of addiction, we just stop indulging our addictions through hard work and will. Setting yourself up for success is just as important or more than having strong will-power. It’s okay to have setbacks, they’re part of the process. Just recommit to quitting as soon as you can and realize your relapse has no bearing on whether or not you will smoke again today, or tomorrow. Nothing in this process makes you a bad person. 
5) Be humble. The only thing worse than smoking is quitting. It’s a fight, quite literally a fight for your life. It’s okay to ask for help. Friends can be a VERY helpful weapon in your arsenal. Tel the people close to you that you really want to quit. Tell your roommates, coworkers, and family. Our addict brains try to create fallbacks and safe spaces so we can always turn back to smoking if we want. The old saying goes “no quarter for prisoners.” Don’t give your addiction a place to live, tell anyone and everyone who will listen that you are finished smoking so they can help hold you accountable. You will feel shame if you tell a coworker you quit, then they catch you smoking two days later. Sometimes we need those motivations, that shame, to get us over that initial hump. 
I’m 10 years nicotine free and could not be happier. You have really good things in store for you, you just have to get through the suck first. Best of luck to you!!!"
"E cigs are the way to go. Didn't go full autist with the culture, just got a good mod weened myself of the nicotine and now I can't even smoke cigs. The crazy fruit flavors make a regular cig taste like straight ass these days. Smoked for 5 yeas half pack to pack a day."

"I vaped.
It allowed me to still have the physical habit of ‘smoking’ and the hot and everything. After a while I began to gradually decrease the nicotine level of my juices down to zero. A short while after that, after maintaining the habit and losing the nicotine dependence I just naturally stopped, didn’t need it anymore!"
"Find a hobby that is exercise related. Eventually you will come to the point that your lungs hate you such much, you have to pick a side and it will become clear. Hopefully. Good luck! "
"Evidently, going into a coma does it!
My grandfather is about 78 years old and started smoking when he was 13. (Can you even imagine? Hell.) About five years ago now, his aorta burst in the middle of the night. It became a fight to save his life, a major heart surgery, and a ten day coma.
He woke up, and while he's not doing the best today, he's still alive... and hasn't smoked since. Not because he wanted to give it up, but had not a single urge since going into the coma."
"This might be so vain, but the reason I quit was wrinkles.  I was getting wrinkles in my lips.  On my face!  And my teeth were hard to keep white.  I hated the fact I was getting smoker's mouth.  I smoked for almost 20 years but quit in less than a month with patches."
"Sounds like BS but when I only thought of it as quitting smoking I always failed. When I realized I really wanted to be a non-smoker, as in that's the identity I want to have, I was able to stick to it. "
"I quit cold turkey in 2015, had a girl that I wanted to date and convinced myself that I would be more desirable if I didn't smoke and that she would like me better. That was my goal, set a goal. As others have said, sunflower seeds are good too! You have to find a reason that you want to quit, that reason might be different for everyone. Also, that girl and I got married in April, so I would say things worked out pretty great."
"For me, before I went cold turkey, I decided I need to break the chain of what I call ""event driven smoking"".  If you really want to quit, stop the habitual stuff.  A smoke when you get in the car, when you leave the office, on the way to lunch, when you drink beer, after a meal, at a certain break time, etc.  Move your cigarette times around so it's not based on anything, or quit one of those smokey treat times as a start and go from there.  It makes it a lot easier to quit when you decide to quit. "
"Two rules did it for me over time.
#1, Don't ever accept that you will always smoke. Always keep in your head that you WILL quit.
#2, Try to think about how it feels to smoke, before and after.  And what you did while you were smoking.
"
"Just quit. Seriously, have some integrity. If you want to quit, quit. If you don't, don't. That's the same thing I told myself and it seems to work. 
Hardest part is on the occasion you have a few drinks you're gonna want to smoke. I haven't figured that part out yet, might have to abstain from alcohol completely. "
"If you are not successful try again.  Each subsequent time you try to quit, you are more likely to actually do it.  "

"Instead of taking cigarette breaks, I would take Dum-Dum breaks.  They last about the same time as a cigarette and your body does the same hand-to-mouth motion.  In part my cravings were satisfied by keeping the pageantry of the cigarette break and it was enough to get me through the day until I didn't think about smoking as much.  15 years later and I still crave a smoke every once and a while, but it's easy to push aside."
"I have a few tips that are super effective, and have worked for me and a few others I've helped. Choose what works for you and also make your own up as you go.
1. Identify how many cigarettes you smoke per day. Number is key. Also identify exactly when you smoke each cigarette. This will help you determine exactly when you crave a smoke. Again, quantification is key!
2. Cut it down by half, and not just that, regulate your timings. If you smoke 10 a day, just smoke 5. And smoke them at regular intervals. Your body forms a new habit. Now continue, till you reach 2 a day, and just stop.
3. Identify stress based triggers or any other triggers, and at that time, just do something else, like walk, listen to music, breathe deeply. Shifting your mind off smoking is key here.
4. Finally, and this is important from day one of quitting, start exercising. It helped me immensely. Not only did I quit smoking, but I also got fitter much faster than I would have. Overall stress levels and triggers also went down.
The more religiously your follow all steps, especially in conjunction with no. 4, the faster you'll quit, and healthier you'll become, for good! Stay strong!

"I haven't smoked in about 13 years, but I never beat my addiction to nicotine.  I still buy nicotine gum.  If I don't have nicotine, I end up becoming incredibly agitated and depressed.  I did manage to beat a meth addiction and a heroin addiction, but not nicotine.  I'm cool with using the gum because it won't give me cancer or emphysema.  The only other tip I can offer is: don't drink alcohol.  To avoid a behavior, you need to have your wits.  Alcohol takes away your wits.  I haven't had a drink in 20 years because of this.  I don't want to end up smoking cigs or using drugs again, so alcohol is a no-no."
"dipping works for me, i dip pouches to get off smoking, after a couple of days i won’t wanna do either "
"I calculated how much I was spending a day in cigarettes (about $10 a day) and put that amount in my dresser drawer at the end of every day that I didn't smoke. Whenever I started feeling the urge, I would open my drawer and see a stack of tens.
I also wrote down all the reasons why I wanted to quit - didn't want to risk getting sick really young, wanted to be able to hike without being out of breath again, was tired of perpetually having a cold. I put the list in my wallet so I could read it whenever I felt the urge.
I also used the nicotine patch. It worked wonders to get rid of the physical addiction.
Lastly...don't beat yourself up if you slip a little. Just make sure you get back on track ASAP. Slipping up doesn't mean that quitting is pointless."
To be honest I just stopped. No easy way about it. Just walk away and dont do it. You are responsible for putting that to your own lips. Nobody forces you but the excuses you make for why you are having one.
Do it cold turkey! If you can survive 21 days without a cigarette I promise you you'll be done. Once you come to hate the smell of cigarette smoke you'll know you're done for good.
"For me it was feeding the oral fixation and having something to do with my hands. I chewed a shit ton of gum, nicotine at first and then eventually just regular gum, and had a little switch to flip with my hand when I got anxious. Now I have a fidget cube, which I'd strongly suggest."

"Just do it cold turkey. Get something to put in your mouth. Suck on a straw, chew gum, drink water, brush your teeth. You might get irritable but really you're just breaking the habit. Insert new soothing/pleasurable things. "
"I read the boom of allen carr, quit smoking. It helped me a lot. Ive smoked a pack a day for 10 years. I read the book and quit. That was 3 years ago. "
I just used a substitute spray and only took it when I seriously needed it. Made a solid plan at the start too about how much I would cut it down each week
"Realize that is is tough, it's something that you have probably been doing habitually for quite some time. Find something else to 'replace' it. I say 'replace' because nothing ever truly will, and the desire to smoke isn't totally diminished because you just ran 3 miles. 
 A few things that helped me.. 1) Exercise, and realizing that smoking is only hindering my athletic performance, 2) Leveraging the time that I have already made it not smoking. Its always easy to take a smoke from a mate, but when you tell yourself ""hey, I've been smoke free for 5 full days, don't fuck it up now"" it really helps you see the progress you've made, 3) Learn to beat the craving. Most cravings last for 15-20 min and if you can out last that, you'll see that you don't need that smoke, it's just the addiction rearing it's ugly head. 
You have to want to quit as well, for your health or for your loved ones sake. It helps to think of things that are more important than smoking, and use that as fuel to keep off the smokes. Be proud of your accomplishments, no matter how small. Any time not smoking is something to be proud of. Keep at it!
"
There has been research that showed quitting cold turkey is better than gradual quitting. Good luck OP!
"For me, finding a nicotine alternative worked very well. I started with a Juul and eventually ended up getting a vape mod for lower nic juice. 10 months smoke free now."
Get bronchitis then you can’t smoke for that weaning time you need lol. That’s what happened to me.
"Smoke/nicotine free for 4 years. What worked for me was creating a ritual around smoking then omitting the smoking. 
Every night I would go for a very short run (1/2 mile to a mile, I now run many many miles!!). Get home shower. Then sit down with a glass of wine or a beer and have my one cigarette of the day. After a few weeks I cut out the cig, then the wine, then my ritual just became running, especially when I’d have a craving.
I think for me it worked because I looked forward to the ritual all day and it made that cigarette special. Cutting it out wasn’t that hard after a while as it wasn’t the main great thing about that hour. 
The running also had an impact because I could see the physical benefits of cutting out smoking by way of distance and ease of the run. Though it took me years of running to get to the point I am now!!
Good luck!"
"I smoked a pack+ a day for 12 years. I did the patch. I tried doctor prescribed medicines. I tried gum. Nothing seemed like it was working but I eventually quit cold turkey. It was not easy.
I had massive muscle cramps in my legs that made it difficult for me to walk at times. I would get nauseous and start vomiting. I'd get anxious when I heard doors open, I'd feel lost after meals. It was terrifying at times. 
What got me through it all? What was worth all of this torture and pain?
I wanted children, and I wanted to be able to run and play with them.  I quit smoking 7 years ago. My son is 6 and likes to play quietly in his room or read books. He's not too into sports at the moment.. My 3-year old daughter gets tired on short walks around the block and insists I carry her around.
**It was still worth it.** 
You need a reason to quit. Something that will become your mantra as you endure a struggle to change every aspect of your life. The longer you've smoked, the more rituals you've developed based around smoking. These rituals are all subtle triggers that you will need to reprogram. The stronger your connection to your goal, the stronger your will will be to change them and be a better you. 
It isn't easy. Good luck!"
"Cold Turkey. Think about the nasty shit it’s doing to your insides, and outsides. I scared myself off them thinking about my health. And don’t put yourself around friends who smoke. Wait until you hit the threshold where you can actually decline them to hang back out with them. Friends who smoke while you’re trying to quit suck. They generally don’t have your best interests in mind and wish they could quit but they don’t really want to. People wear smoking and the ‘lack of ability to quit smoking’ as a badge of honor. It’s disgusting. People wear their ‘years of service’ to cigarettes as the same badge of honor. “Oh, you quit after only two years of smoking, cute. I’ve been smoking for 10 years. I just can’t quit.” Those people don’t want to quit. There’s a sick bravado in it for them. "
"Start smoking your first one later and later in the day.
&#x200B;
Your body spends all day trying to catch up with the ""fix"" from the first cigarette. If you start later, you'll spend less time chasing it. I started pushing it back 15 minutes every few days. So 9Am->9.15->930 etc.
At one point I wasn't having a smoke until after 5PM and I was only having a few a day. It was a lot easier to just walk away then. 
  
I quit 22 years ago and there have been more than a few times where I have really wanted one, but after about 2 or 3 weeks, it was a lot easier to resist.

Good luck!"
"You have to be ready to quit, for one. 
We used monq pens until they ran out, that helped. The lavender helps calm you, or whatever flavor you choose. 
Also cinnamon toothpicks helped me, my wife never tried em. 
My wife is also super into crystals and their metaphysical properties (which is oddly understandable even though it sounds batshit). We both drank a ""Crystal Elixir"", which was water, amethyst, and botswana agate. Let em sit over night, drink it (sans crystals) in the morning. Don't know if that did the trick, but I havent had a cig since.

To all you teens out there: Not starting is the best way of quitting.
There was a website I often referred to called whyquit.com.  Had a day by day explanation of what to expect that was pretty accurate.  I'd recommend cold turkey.
"Vaping. Started with the stuff as strong as cigarettes and slowly worked the amount of nicotine down over a few months until I got to zero. Eventually charging batteries and filling the tiny tanks got to be more hassle than it was worth and I just left it with a dead battery. 
It was my brother in law’s idea, worked for him too. 
Tip: Don’t go for the flavors that try to taste like cigarettes, find something timeless that you enjoy like coffee or mint flavored. "
"A friend told me he had just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and had six months to live. I gave him the rest of my pack and went cold turkey. That was 18 years ago. I had smoked for 9 years.   
 
For the first two years it was quite hard. I enjoyed hanging around with smokers and getting second hand smoke. But that lessened as I went on. I'm now quite anti smoking. It smells awful and really is quite disgusting so I stay away from people who smoke. It gets a lot easier.  "

"Honestly, I found that when I was craving a smoke, my breathing was very shallow and short. When I focused on taking long, deep breaths, my cravings went away. I went cold turkey from 1.5 packs a day, 2 packs a day on weekends for 8 years. Haven't looked back since. It's been 7 years since I quit. "

2. Get the patch - it helped me
3 Get nicotine gum - for a while.
4. Most important: you have to change the memory of a cigarette in your brain.  Remember what it tastes like when you first tried it - not like it does when you've had a few cocktails, etc."
"I am 35 years old, I quit several times. I have been smoke free for two years and I will never go back. Why? I have gum disease. And it’s quite visible which side of my mouth I used to smoke from. My gums have receded higher in the place I used to have my cigaret dangling. That really made me think, what the hell am I doing to myself?"
"""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" By Allen Carr. I am 10 months smoke free after 16 years. I had tried countless times before but always failed, whether it was due to some stressor or finally having a drink, there was always an excuse to go back. Even when I made it a few months, I still felt like I was going to have to live my life feeling like I was missing out on something that brought me joy! This was my last ditch effort before I resigned myself to always being a smoker. It sounds too good to be true, I get that, but it works! Please just try it. Even if you feel like it wont work. Just read it. It's life changing. "
"Get pregnant, not available to most redditors"
I stopped many times but quit?... after about the 100th time stopping I finally just went cold turkey. The first day is tough. the first week is harder. If you can get past that the rest is just continued will power for the rest of your life just not as often as time progresses.
"I honestly bought a vape and just used the 2mg juice in it for about a month, eventually the coils on the vape starting burning out waaay too fast and that gross off-taste was enough for me to put that down too."
"I smoked for about 13 years, tried quitting and failed like 3 times. I decided i would try and quit when my stress was at an all time low, i saw the moment and jumped on it and it worked. I was running a construction job and we were wildly succesful so i had two weeks on site where my crew was done before everybody else, so i was there in case i was needed. I have been smoke free for 3 years now. Id recommend taking a vacation maybe and using it to try and quit, i truly believe the lack of stress was the main factor that helped me."
i ate chocolate when i craved a cigarette.  Eventually i just wanted more and more chocolate.
"taper down:  
  
First spend some time to get a feel for how many you smoke a day.  
  
Now each week subtract that number by one.  
  
Once you get down to like 2 cigs a day stretch it out to two weeks.  
  
Then finally when you get down to 1 cig do it for a week then commit to 0 for two weeks.  
  
The first couple days suck but after that it really isn't that bad.  
  
Also try to ""replace"" it with something more healthy.  
  
For me I took non-smoke smoke breaks with some coffee.  
  
Best advice I can give though is listen to everyone's advice, try different things until you find what works for you."
"Keep that last pack.  Write ""LAST PACK"" and the date it was finished on the pack itself with a big silver or other highly visible sharpie.  Keep that pack in a place where you will see it EVERY DAY, preferably several times a day.  Mine is on my bedside table so the very first and last thing I see every day is that last pack I finished 3 months ago.  I've had cravings since I quit like everybody else but the image of that pack and that date are burned into my mind now and I can't make all that for nothing."
"1. Stop smoking.
2. Don't be a bitch and get through the three days after.
3. Replace it with masturbation or sex.
Never smoke again. Not even one."
"Give yourself a simple pros and cons list. (I’m formerly a 2-pack-a-week on average smoker for the past 10 years, coming up on one year being smoke free and I feel great)
If anything, I miss the social part, the complement it was for drinking and de-stressing...  But that’s it. 
If I could go back in time and tell myself it was never really worth it, I would.
Less to carry, less to spend, less anxiety about health effects, ...less to worry about how I smell.
More self respect, better stamina during exercise, better physical appearance.
Some smokers would give me the “you were never really hooked” but IMO, it really is a personal scale of habit to will-power."
Sunflower seeds. Keep your oral fixation fixed
"Pack a day since high school, about fifteen years.  Blue E-cig came out around 2012.  Started on those, mixed with the occasional regular cig.  Went to the blues only.  No satisfaction from the blue at all.  Quit both entirely over six years ago, with zero slips!"
"Me and my ex used to share Camels every time we'd hang out. This went on for about 3 years. After a nasty break-up, I just stopped smoking altogether. It wasn't hard, I just stopped. Drinking, on the other hand, increased exponentially. It was only until recently that I finally kicked that habit too."
my death
Think of all the money you could save
Don’t be a bitch 
"In October I decided to quit smoking on new year. At the end of November I bought enough cigarettes (smoking for about 35 years makes you know how much you smoke a day) to last me until new year. I removed every ashtray and peripheral. I did save one astray and one lighter then placed the pile of cigarettes beside it. Every time I smoked I was looking at the cigarettes telling my self ""that's all I have to smoke when it's gone it's over"". I psyched my self for a month and at new year I grabbed the ashtray and lighter, walked out and tossed it in the trash.
The following 3 months was the worst time of my life. If someone had robed me at gunpoint I'd plead with him to kill me. I did get thru it and now 3.9 years later I'm doing fine. My cravings stopped less then a year after. Every now and then the brain tell you ""Psst hey you haven't smoked for so long it's likely you won't like it, test one and lets see if it's true!"". Every time that happens you have to be strong and say NO! fuck that, I'm not going true that again.
Good luck out there on quitting."
Live in Canada and dont smoke in your house 
"Cold turkey. It sucks for a few weeks, but it gets easier. I found that it’s easier to count the days of you quit cold turkey, rather than weaning yourself. Being able to say “it’s been 3 months, two weeks and three days since my last cigarette!” Is an accomplishment and I don’t want to ruin my streak! 
Also, I got a Juul from the gas station. It satisfies the nicotine craving, smells and tastes a hell of a lot better, I can puff on it in my house with no ill effects and it ended up being cheaper ($15 for 4 Juul pods, I go through a pod every day or two, versus $8 per pack that I would go through in the same amount of time)"
When you start getting those withdrawal sweats hit the gym or the sauna
just say no and stay strong
"You need to find a real reason for which you are stopping, I was able to stop by pure will in a single day when I finally found my reason, because smoking would be dis-respecting it. Just saying I wanted it before was not enough, because nothing was holding me accountable if I slipped."
Get a juul
"You gotta run the treadmill or smoke weed when your feeling overwhelmed. Can't do either? Suck it up til you can. Quitting is not easy but do you really want to be a slave to a habit you don't even have any benefit from? Show that you're not as weak willed as most the people around you. You can do it. Also, drink lots and lots of water and flush your system. "
"The best way I can explain it, is that one day I decided I was no longer a smoker, I just didnt do it. Regardless of how I felt or what I thought, I just didnt smoke anymore. That worked for me. One day I decided I was a non smoker."
"I told myself that the next time I got a sick (like a cold) I would not smoke. It happened to coincide with lack of money. So I got sick, had no cigarettes, and had no money. I had a hit off my sisters cigarette 3 months later and hated it. I haven't had smoked in 3 years and I have 0 cravings. I do sometimes feel like I am forgetting something but no actual cravings. 
I do sometimes have dreams that I picked it up again and wake up in a panic that I am smoking again just to realize I still don't.
TL;DR: told myself to not smoke next time, got sick and broke at the same time so quit smoking. Haven't had a cigarette for 3 years."
"For me I just quit buying them. If I could fight the urge to get in the truck and drive to the store then I didn't have any. I went through a period where I would buy some and think I'll only get them if I really need one. If you have them handy.. you will smoke them.   
Fight the urge to buy them and you won't have any to smoke.  
Also break it down into managable chunks of time. Just get to lunch without one... Good... now just get to 5:00 without one.. make it through dinner... one before bed? Nope.. and boom your 24 hrs in  
Make it to 3 days and it gets so much easier."
I went the Chantix route. Didn’t have any problem quitting and have not really been seriously tempted in nearly 5 years now. It is pretty powerful and i experienced some aggressive behavior towards the end (3 months) and really crazy dreams the whole time. 
"Have a plan. Don’t just say you’re gonna quit bec you never will.
I quit with a vape. I started my nicotine at 22 ml potency and djaled it back 1 ml a month until I got to zero. Took me two years but it’s worked."
Instead of 2 packs a day i started with 4 that helped a lot for me.
Calculated the money i would save and thought of benefits with regards to health and breath. Quit cold turkey and just sticked to it
"Just keep quitting. It's easy to get discouraged when you slip up, having to reset the ""days since our last incident"" calendar in your head."
Do it cold turkey and try to have the mindset that you never smoked in the first place I quit after 10 years. Started when I was 13.
"Start using an e-cig for about 3 months. Then just stop. For me, it was way easier to quit just nicotine than all the other crap in a cigarette."
"15-minute rule worked great for me. Nicotine cravings last only 15 minutes, then they subside. They may be back 5 minutes later if you are a heavy smoker who is quitting cold turkey, but every time you don't smoke, the span of time in between cravings gets a little longer. Just do something engaging for that 15 minutes. I found that exercise or sex/masturbation worked the best to get my mind off it. 
The first 48 hours were the worst, especially at night when I was trying to sleep. My first time quitting, I had sweats at night that I couldn't hack, so I caved and bought some, chain smoked a few, then slept like a baby. The final time I quit, I didn't kid myself with delusions of strength or will power - I bought some sleeping pills and knocked myself out 2 nights in a row. Much easier. 4.5 years later, still smoke free! "
I stopped being around people who smoke. Then just stopped smoking abruptly. The sight of cigs is a great way to keep smoking. I smoked half a pack daily for 5+ years and then just stopped. It's been 3 years since I smoked. 
"Pot.  
Ensure you have three - preferably four - days where you can not be worth a shit. Wake & bake. And everytime you wanna smoke a cig, take a toke. By the fourth day, you're over it. The nicotine is mostly gone by that point. Four days. It's also helpful if your fam, S.O., roommates, whoever, are aware of your purging, but not constantly asking the whole ""how's it going"" kinda questions. Stay in the fog, & once it lifts it's a whole new horizon!  
The real issue is the re-entry, going to the pub, taking a break at work, what to do while you're ""waiting,"" waiting for the bus, or your friend to pick you up, or whatever. I enjoy pistachios, sunflower seeds, breathing... I hope this helps, I went 30 yrs. and I want a cigarette every day, and every day is one more I likely would not have had if I still smoked!"

"I was smoking a few a day in college. I also was getting into running and training for a 10 miler. What made me quit, after many, many attempts at quitting. I actually gave up quitting and was like, oh well.. ill be a smoker for a bit longer. What made me quit, was after an 8 mile run, all I could think of was smoking a cigarette and wanting a cigarette badly. Finally, I get back from teh run.. out of breath, red faced and dying. I go to my room, grab a smoke, go outside and smoke it.. it proceeds to be the worst cigarette I have ever had in my life. Along with being out of breath, I felt incredibly horrible and stopped for a long time after that. Now, I do very very rarely"
I used the gum for about a week. Didn't even think about having one because I was getting the nicotine. Then I had to sort of trick myself. I convinced myself that I had already quit smoking and that quitting gum wouldn't be hard. It worked and I haven't had nicotine in over four years. 
"I went to Delhi on holiday.
Tried to have a smoke as normal, lungs turned themselves inside out and told me to go f\*\*k myself.
Got home, couldn't smoke anymore.
&#x200B;"
"Frequented r/stopsmoking which led to The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Our Father Allen Carr. That book was the key to get me in the right mindset and the first thing I suggest to people who want to quit. Used the app Smoke Free to keep me straight and put things into perspective. During the thick of it, chewing straws, snacking on veggie straws and baby carrots, chugging water, and paying attention to how my body was changing and improving stopped me from giving in to cravings. 1 year, 8 months since my last cigarette. I don't even know why I ever smoked at this point and I have zero desire to go back to it. Waking up not feeling like my chest is on fire is pretty cool, and I have the nose of a bloodhound. Still get winded when I work out but that's a me problem..."
i fell off the wagon after years of not smoking. stress has gotten to me lately. 
Wife made me do it. Smoke free since december. Went cold turkey one day and that was it. 
"Find a smoker that you don't like. Karen, the annoying coworker, or Jacob, the prententious hipster. Channel your hate. Refuse to smoke because you're better than them. Every time you get an urge, remind yourself that those fuckers are gonna die before you do. If they ask you to join them for a smoke, laugh to yourself as they walk alone, dragging the ball and chain of addiction. You want to stop at the gas station and grab a pack? You'll be able to afford a nice vacation in a matter of months while they will be financially crippled by addiction. You're better than them and don't ever forget it. "
Honestly the biggest thing was I stopped hanging out with other people that smoke. In a social bubble by myself it was easy not to smoke but then I'd go hang out with someone that did and I'd inevitably bum one off of them.
"When I quit in 2001 I personally found it helpful to replace the hand-to-mouth ""ritual"" with carrot sticks cut to the length of cigarettes.  I was told the hardest part to quit was ""the ritual"" of it all, it's a psychological comfort as well as a physical addiction, but your body gets over the physical addiction surprisingly quickly (about a month I believe), behaviours take longer to change.  So I used to still go outside on my work break with my carrot stick and stand there and slowly munch on it at the rate I would have smoked a cigarette, breathing in slowly as I did.  It might sound dumb, but it worked for me.  Eventually just going out for a breath of fresh air was enough."
Reading the Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Alan Carr and visiting r/stopsmoking worked for me. I don’t think anyone could read Alan Carr’s book without quitting even if they wanted to continue to smoke. I read it as a skeptic just kind of wanting to quit. Been about 8 years now and never missed smoking for a minute. 
"Vaping can make quitting fairly easy since you can control the dosage of nic. Start with 24mg or so for a few weeks. Then step down to 12mg for a few weeks. Then 6, then 3.
At first vaping sucks and all you can think about is how much better a cig is. But eventually you will come around and it will be fine, or in some cases people end up liking it even more. And during the whole process you will still be getting nic, but not any of the other garbage that's in cigs. 
There's a lot of ways to quit, but I think vaping may be the easiest. "
Stay away from other smokers
"Just do it. Seriously. I hated that I was smoking and I couldn’t take not breathing anymore, so I threw my new pack of smokes into the fireplace and watched them burn. Been two years next month. 
It takes discipline, endurance and resolve like other commenters have already said. You’ll never be truly ready. Just dooooo itttttt"
"For me it was a matter of deciding that I wanted to quit. Not because of what other people thought, simply decide that I did not want to smoke anymore. The rest was easy."
"Recognize that if you continue smoking that odds are that something bad to your health could happen. For me, my mother died from lung cancer before she was 60. It's a painful death and while there are no guarantees that if you quit, it won't happen, but don't you want to improve your odds?
There is nothing cool about smoking. People hate smokers! Why do you want to be part of a hated group that you voluntarily join?
Smoking is expensive. Can't you use the money for other things?
Bottom line though, YOU HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT!!! It has to be your genuine desire. That s most of it. "
"TBH, I stopped smoking cigarettes by substituting with weed whenever I got the urge for a month or two. Then scaling back on the weed was way easier than tobacco.  Obviously this method won't work for many but I was fortunate enough at the time to be working a menial job where being stoned didn't matter.  Now, that plan wouldn't work at all."
"Do whatever it takes. I had to use chantix. Remember, you have to change how you think about certain. Frustrated a little at work, no more smoke break. It will get easier but the first week after i quit, people told me i was a bear. I had to relearn how to be frustrated and mad."
"Get a vape, ween yourself down to .2 % nicotine, and then take a week long vacation somewhere you can relax and don't take your vape.
Used to smoke half a pack a day, haven't had nicotine in 2 years.
Obviously *results may vary* but I feel, with most addictions, willpower is 95% of the battle, and if you really want to quit, you can."
Wellbutrin really helped me. I was already on it for depression. When I decided to quit I didn’t have physical cravings. Like at all. I was confused until I figured out that it was the Wellbutrin. I still had to overcome the mental addiction but it was SO much easier without the physical withdrawal. 
"Try various replacements. Get rid of your cigs add lights, as instead of smoking, use a nicorette inhaler, you pull on it just the same as a normal cig but it doesn't smell. When you've been on the inhaler a few weeks, use the spray. It gives you a great hit, and breaks the hand to mouth movement habit. Once you feel like the replacements are all you need, start chewing the gum, just find a flavour that you enjoy. After a while, you'll hate the smell of tobacco and you'll have minty fresh breath while you get your kick. Eventually, take a piece of normal gum instead of the nicotine gum, and gradually repeat this more frequently to reduce your nicotine levels, then try a day with no nicotine at all, just normal gum. If you can't, don't worry, just have a nicotine gum and try again the next day. Eventually, you'll get to a point where when you need a boost you'll just have a piece of normal gum and the craving will disappear."
"Chain smoking until I threw up fixed a decade of cancer sticks. I also had the flu at the time, which expedited the vomiting. I'll never forget that taste as long as I live."
"Stay away from your smoking friends for a few months at least. Don't drink alcohol for a couple months. Sleep whenever you can for the first week. Drink lots of water.
I quit cold turkey it whe only thing that worked for me. 
Also no you cannot have ""just one because you haven't had one all day"""
"**Good luck, OP, you can do it!!! Join the ex-smokers club with me!**
COLD TURKEY.  I tried multiple crutches: (gum, patches, lozenges, wellbutrin) all failed. I wasted years of my life (15 to be exact) and countless dollars. One won't quit smoking until one is *truly* ready. When that time comes, and one is committed, simply \*stop smoking\*. Just choose a day to start your smoke free life and enjoy not being a prisoner to smelly fingers and clothes, premature aging, emphysema, etc... It worked for me and I have little to no will power, which is why being mentally prepared and committed is so important."
"Make sure you do a proper goodbye to smoking. That is, treat it like a relationship ending, because in many ways it is. It's like cutting a toxic friend out of your life. You need to acknowledge that there will be a sense of loss and allow yourself to experience that. Then cut all ties and walk away."
In the process right now. I find it’s easier when you have someone else to quit with. Also bought a vaping pen. Went from 6 packs a week down to 1 ^.^
I honestly found it relatively easy. I had a weekend where I smoked waaaaay too much. I woke up on Monday feeling like a car was on my chest and I was all out of cigarettes. Given the feeling in my chest it was easy to not smoke that day. I woke up Tuesday and didn't think about a cigarette all day. Then on Wednesday I thought about it and realized I should just keep it going because the urge wasn't immense. I'm not smoke free for eight months.
For me it was milestones. Make it the first day. Then make it the first week. Then 2 weeks. It was all downhill for me after 2 weeks. 
"Enter Shia Labouf screaming ""Just deeewwww it!!!"""
I got a pretty severe case of reflux acid which in turn led me to have my first panic attack because I thought my heart was failing. Wasn't hard to quit after that.
Have a doctor look you over.
"Get a vape and start off with the normal nicotine levels and slowly decrease until you’re vaping the nicotine free juice
Find something else to fill in your cravings.
20 crunches or pushups instead of a cigarette. This ones a lot harder to stick to. 
Or the trick that worked for me. Move to a city where they’re stupid expensive with brutal winters. I quit when I ran out and realized I had to walk a couple blocks through a blizzard to waste $15."
"Nicotine patches did it for me. Vaping just turned into another addiction. Patches give a constant dose of nicotine throughout the day and cut down in increments. I also cut patches in half to half the dosage near the end too. Not really ""supposed"" to do that, but I did it anyway.
Just don't go to sleep with them on. I did a couple times, nicotine interferes with REM sleep and you get some crazy dreams "
Get Bronchitis 
"Smoked contraband *kretek* cigarettes and then the government started to tighten up the security and I could no longer find them easily. Smoked less and less, and one day I realised I hadn't smoked for a few days. Tried to see if I could make it to a month just to brag about it. Then it became two months. Then it became almost five years now.
Looking back I was very busy during those days, so ultimately (as is the case with many tasks that on the surface require a ton of willpower) what will really get the job done is an ample amount of distraction."
"Pregnancy. I wanted to quit almost as soon as I started smoking but, well, we know how addictions happen. As soon as I saw the positive test I was done. Crossing my fingers it sticks after the bubs is born."
"Don't beat yourself up if you try to quit and fail. Just try again, however many times it takes until you are successful. Worked for me.
 Eventually."
"I vaped before vaping was cool.  I committed to vaping for 24 hours and then when I lit a cig, the taste was utterly horrible.  I did start at the highest nicotine level and brought it down here and there.  I vaped for a good two years until I ran out of batteries and couldn't vape for a couple of days and then decided I was done with it since I was going to a family reunion and they would have made fun of me for vaping.  lol.  I smoked for over 20 years and when I substituted the vape for the cigs I was at a pack a day."
I did the weening method. Allow myself x per day for a couple weeks. Then gradually get lower until you're on like 1 or 2 then you really don't want it.
"You have to want to quit, there are lots of tips and tricks to help, but if you don't want to quit you're always going to fail.  
That said, I worked it out of my routine and set guidelines around when I was allowed to smoke.  E.g. I used to always light up whenever I got in the car, always after a meal, whenever I had my morning coffee... etc.  First I got rid of those and only smoked when I really needed it.  That cut me back over a month or so to 4-5 cigarettes a day.  From there I switched to the lozenges and cut back to eventually nothing.  The lozenges were good to take the crazy out of the cravings when you get them.  You can control the dosage of nicotine in the lozenges as well, so it's easy to monitor and decrease the dose over time.  Then eventually you just don't do it anymore. "
"This probably sounds like a dumb reason to quit, but I got tired of the need to buy cigarettes and cigars all the time. Not necessarily the cost, but the need to stop in to another store to replenish my supply. 
&#x200B;
It was a process. I replaced cigarettes and clove cigars by switching to vaping. After a couple years, started to reduce the amount I vaped, and then at some point, realized that I hadn't touched the vape in 3-4 days. At that point, it was like, well, guess that means I quit. Smoked a clove on vacation a couple months ago, and didn't even enjoy it.
&#x200B;
Definitely not a process that will work for everyone, but after somewhere around 6 months off, it must have worked for me."
"My granny just stopped, overnight, she just said she didnt want to smoke anymore.
My dad smokes from a young age (13) and he smoked up until my older brother was about to be born, and my sister was still less than a few weeks. He said he didnt want his bad decision to affect us, and he says it the greatest decision hes ever made"
"I had started smoking weed, and I ran out of butts on the way home from work where I would normally smoke 2. Decided I was going to see how long I could go before buying another pack. I had 1 on a camping trip the following weekend and haven’t since. The weed helped a lot. And some can argue its one ha it for another but I can’t tell you how much better I feel. "
"Do not make deals with yourself in regards to slipping one here or there just don't do it.  Altoids; keeps a medium sized thing in your pocket for the weight, when you reach you get a treat and not a cigarette.
&#x200B;"
"Don't have a spare pack lying around. I tried to quit multiple times and I would always have a spare one, I would tell myself ""just in case"" I had a really stressful day or was drinking with buddies or whatever reason. I would tell myself I'm just cutting down slowly, which was nice at the start but you have to make the jump and show commitment at some point. Once I made the decision not to buy anymore it became easy when I didn't have the temptation around. "
"Perhaps not the most experienced; 
But,I quit after 2 years by making the decision in my head I wasnt a smoker and then ending that night by getting sick off of cigarettes. 
Kinda rewired it for me. "
"My mother quit after being diagnosed with COPD in her 70's -- 60-year smoker. The damage is done, though. Any surgery she needs now has to be done WITHOUT general anesthesia because they can't keep her sufficiently oxygenated. "
"[This](https://whyquit.com/joel/index-guide.html) along with the [abundance of other material in ""Joel's library""](https://whyquit.com/joel/index.html) did the trick for me. 
[Here's a good, short article to get you started.](https://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_02_01_my_cig_my_friend.html) I read this years before I actually quite and it really stuck with me, nagging at me in the back of mind. "
"Once I remove myself from situations where I would normally be smoking the rest pretty much came naturally. remove the situations where you smoke, remove people that smoke around you, remove the triggers that would cause you to smoke or replace smoking in those scenarios with something else."
"I smoked for over 10 years. How I quit smoking cigarettes was to stop going out with friends that smoke and stop drinking any alcoholic beverages. Basically no more social fun with friends for awhile!!! 
Also think of new ways to stay busy. I’d say this is going to change your life style for next 6-12 months if you do decide to quit.
Good luck and stay strong!!"
Actually wanting to stop. As well as realizing that the positives does not outweigh the negatives. 
"Start weightlifting. I did, and while I've started and stopped smoking a couple times since then. I typically have been non-smoking for longer than smoking."
"I struggled for years to quit.  Did cold turkey, acupuncture, and just cold hard will power.  Nothing worked until I tried welbutran.  It's an antidepressant that people were stopping without intending to stop.  
Basically you set your date 3 weeks out and start taking it.  By three weeks I found I'd cut my habit in half already.  I quit without either cravings or massive mood swings.  After a few months you stop the welbutran.
The only downside was I gained a bunch of weight that took several years to lose...  
Go see your gp.   Then start exercising as part of your new life.
"
Use heroine 
Literally farts are more pleasing to the nose than a smoker's stench.
"Before you quit, smoke 3-4 cigarettes very quickly then try to remember that taste. Everytime you crave think back to that taste"
Salt on the tongue when I had cravings. 
"I started vaping at the highest strength and slowly cut the strength over 6 months to '0' nicotine, from day one I stopped smoking cigarettes and have been off both vaping and cigarettes for approx 4 years now and have no urge to restart either.
If you are going to try vaping I would recommend going with any flavour juice other than tobacco flavours to 'retrain' your taste."
I tried quitting and it worked. 
"Just quit cold turkey and do not smoke anything. It get easier every day a little bit, I tell you that.
Also when you have a cravings,  just go to breath some fresh air outside, you will notice that your brain can be tricked into thinking that you smoked already.
Good luck :). Smoke free more than 3 years already"
"Smoked Goto Kola, lobelia and mullen. Careful of lobelia, not for human consumption, can induce comas, similar to opiates. 
Wellbutrin generic is buspirone. Take the pill and keep smoking after a couple of weeks you don't feel like smoking. Then taper off of meds."
I vaped. Now to quit vaping lol
"I quit 4 years ago after I had a bad cold/flu.  I'd been trying to quit for years, but this time it stuck.  I'll be smoke free for 4 years in December.  The key for me was actually wanting to quit.  It's one thing to quit because it's healthy, or because someone wants you to, but it's a heck of a lot easier if you yourself actually want to quit.  "
"Lollipops. 
Smoking is an oral fixation and answering that need helped. Also, I don't really like lollipops, they last way too long, so it eventually got annoying enough to also quit the lollipops. "
"I would say start vaping, but since for most of all people smoke and vape are the same, i think this answer is not valid for you "
"0 nicotine vape did it for me. You get over the chemical addiction quickly but habit will get you. If you are like me you will be successful until you are at a bar with a friend who smokes. If you don't have your vape accessible at that moment then you will fail. If you solve that problem then you win.
Smoke free for three years now and lost my vape this year and it's never crossed my mind since. (My two and a half year old daughter plays a big role in my confidence in not going back to smoking)."
"Anybody who says they're ""cutting down / cutting back on cigarettes before quitting for good"" have no real intention of quitting. 
Cold Turkey or start back up next month. Your choice. "
"I quit smoking 9 days ago. I've had to literally bitch slap myself across the face to keep myself from buying a pack. 
That was day 1-7 though, the past couple days I've only had a couple small cravings that went away after 5 min. I even went to the gym and ran 7 miles the other day!
My recommendation is to just quit cold Turkey. Nicotine is evil and you only have to deal with the withdrawal for a short period.
"
"Give yourself a specific reason for wanting to quit.  Ask yourself why.
For me, I just couldn't stand the il-health any more.  The constant coughing and wheezing, being out of breath.  And I just didn't like the smoke and the ash any more.  With all that in mind quitting was easy."
"Get an e cigarette!
2 months smoke free now, and I feel great. 
"
"You have to be ready. If you’re not ready it’s going to be a lot harder to quit. Best advice I can give is keep yourself active when you quit. I don’t mean physical exercise, though that wouldn’t hurt, but do things around your house that will keep your mind off of having a cigarette long enough. Another thing that helped me continue not smoking is tracking the money I’ve saved by not smoking. "
"Might be buried but what worked for me was limiting when I could have one. I started by not letting myself smoke at home because I was watching my infant son. If I stepped out for a smoke and locked myself out of the house with him inside I never would ha e forgiven myself so I only smoked at work. Then after getting used to that, I stopped buying them. This meant that if I wanted one at work I had to bum one. After a while I stopped being that guy who was always bu.ming smokes and just quit. That was the scariest step."
"Probably gonna get hate for this because many Redditors seem to have a serious superiority complex on the subject, but the only thing that worked for me is vaping."
Get alcohol poisoning and start throwing up to the point your throat swells up and can't swallow anything for days. This is what I did and I have been smoke free for over 2 years.
"You gotta get yourself hooked on a different drug in order to quit.  I chew tobacco now which I eventually plan to quit.  At least, I'm spreading the cancer risk around to different parts of my body instead of concentrating it solely on my lungs."
Wait until you have a really nasty chest cold. The first drag is like a bottle brush swabbing out your throat and lungs. Good time to go cold turkey.
"Did it right before I was going to have an incredibly busy two weeks. When the two weeks were over I had enough time sunk into it to keep going.  Also, I have an app called “smoke free”. It logs how much time and money you’ve saved. It’s motivating. 
It also helped to actually want to quit. I’d quit before, but my heart wasn’t into it. When I finally did it I was sure. 
Good luck!  "
"I've been smoke-free for 9 years this coming November. This is how I did it.
First off: Don't quit smoking. **Stop**. ""Quit"" has many negative connotations, so it's seen as a negative for some of us. ""Stop,"" on the other hand, is more neutral.
Second: Don't keep a pack of smokes somewhere ""just in case."" Leaving yourself an out is just admitting you may not succeed in stopping.
Get yourself through the first week. It's a bitch, but that's about when the worst of the withdrawal will occur. Take it day-by-day, and gut it out.
I suggest doing it cold turkey. The withdrawal has acted as a negative reinforcement against starting back up.
Once you're past the first week, find something to keep your hands busy. Adjust to the new reality that you have a sense of smell and taste, and focus on how awesome they are. Don't stay away from smokers... realize that that's how **you** smelled when you were a smoker.
Above all, don't nag your friends who still smoke to quit, and don't evangelize about how awesome it is to be smoke-free. That's the kind of thing that pushes people not to stop."
"You have to want it and mean it. If this is the case  you just stop, keep stopping and stay stopped."
"Well, marijuana became legal in my state so I replaced one vice for another, but I smoke once or twice per day as opposed to 5-10 times.  Progress?"
"How I did it: It was a huge burden to my wallet and the high was not even anything special, so I just stopped one day cold turkey. First 3 days were annoying but not that hard as people make it to be. You just need to remember that you have free will and nothing is forcing you light that cigarette, it's all in your head, your body doesn't need it. Also, have a bunch of fruit with you and snack on that as a ""replacement"". Just remeber that you are not an animal and don't let something retarded like nicotine grasp you, you're stronger than that.
I have been cigarette free for about 10 months now, I don't plan on starting again ever. "
"I just quit cold turkey and whenever I wanted one for those first few days, I'd just tell myself that the triggers would fade and eventually dissappear along with the withdrawl headaches and cramps. Simple but it worked for me. The trick is to not give in. No ""one last smoke"" cause that's how you end up smoking one the next day, and two the day after and so on. It sucks, but nut up and just quit. The pain doesn't last forever. "
"You've got to really WANT to quit.  When I did, I was ready. Tossed half a pack of camel wides and never had another one.  I had quit before, and I'll warn ya, don't even think about having another drag or smoke at all.  I'd quit for a year once and had ONE drag off a cigarette and by the end of the day is bought my own pack.  As for this time, been 15 years this past July"
"I had stopped twice before and started cigarettes again, finally quitting successfully on the third attempt.
The reason for stopping has to be more important to you than the reason for continuing, and you have to resist the urge to join other smokers in a social context until you no longer actually crave one.
Now the smell of cigarettes (not cigars or pipes) totally disgusts me, which definitely helps not to start again. "
"Chantix. Chantix is the answer. Smoked for 10 years, and it worked for me, I've been a non smoker for the last 6 months, nothing else worked. Now I have no cravings at all. "
"You'll likely backslide. That's okay. Start over. 
Stay busy.  Exercise, hobbies, anything that's new. Break your old smoking timing and routine. 
Tell yourself that you just need to get through the first 2 days and you'll feel fine. Then, after 2 days, challenge yourself to finish out the week. Then the month.
If you absolutely, positively CANNOT resist, try an over-the-counter electronic cigarette as a compromise. Disposable and inexpensive. (You're not using it long term.) 
Use whatever works for you. Gum? Patches? Cold Turkey? Everyone is different.
Coffee can help mitigate the absence of nicotine. Coffee, not frappes/lattes/etc. Just coffee. Black. "
"Champix. Its a drug you can take which block the nicotine receptors in your brain. It's amazing. 
It also gives you the craziest dreams you will ever experience. I once dreamt I got kicked out by my Mrs, and then went to friends house to stay. The room my friend put me up in was stacked to the rafters with unpackaged chicken kievs with just enough floor space for my sleeping bag. "
Make every cigarette a reminder that you are killing yourself.  Make it a habit to think about your health when you feel like smoking
2 years smoke free after smoking for 14 years. Quit cold turkey. Willpower and determination. Oh and a pregnant wife. That’ll do it every time 
"There is no real way to stop the cravings. Just remember that every day will be a little easier than the last.  Forgive yourself for slipping up about other things (eating badly, being less responsible). You're sick, let yourself be sick."
"I took Welbutrin.  It removed all the physical symptoms of the cravings and shit, the only thing left was the mental addiction.  I barely gained any weight and had almost none of the mood swings.  If you can take it, I highly suggest it.
So, in addition, I stopped doing the things that I normally did while smoking.  Stopped going to bars and coffee shops, at least for a while (switched to gaming at friends houses where nobody smoked, or my own place).  At work, I still gave myself ""smoke breaks"" but I just got up, walked away, played a game on my phone or something, and came back to work.
Set a quit date.  Make it a hard line, no more cigarettes after that date.  Don't be one of the ""oh I'm down to xx a day"".  Making it a long process of reduced intake helps some people, but it makes ""quitting"" take just that much longer.  If you slip up, just keep going, don't set another ""quit date"", just accept you made a mistake and move on from it.
CLEAN YOUR SPACES.  Anywhere you live or work or drive, clean it.  Get that smoke smell out.  You may not notice it now but you will, even if you don't smoke there, there's a faint scent.  On your quit date, get all paraphernalia out.  No lighters, matches, cigarettes, clean all your laundry, febreeze or replace furniture, ashtrays are gone...  Everything.
Have someone to help you out.  If you're having a *really bad* day, come up with a mechanism, something to do that's different.  Something that you enjoy but don't associate with smoking.  Take up a *new* hobby (motorcycles are a good one.  Friend of mine did skydiving)."
"This will probably get buried but. 
1. Go cold turkey 
2. Visit a sauna and sweat the nicotine out. I would go once a day for 3/4 days 
3. Find something to do with your hands. 
4. Keep taking breaks but fill them up with something else. I make and drink a lot of tea now 
5. Don’t hang around smokers whilst they are smoking. If your mates smoke don’t go with them to smoking area. "
Champix is a wonderful medication
I quit drinking for 6 months. It was always the path back to smoking. 2 years smoke free now.
"cut out smokers in your life. At least for now. 
My neighbor and myself used to have a ritual of smoking together after work. Now I see her go on her lonesome self to sit out on the curb. I do not feel bad about it at all."
"Realize you will have to fight off the temptation to smoke several times a day. Then learn to recognize the feeling or situation that leads to the rise in you considering and strategizing if,how, when, to light that cigarette.  Then whenever that feeling or situation comes up train yourself to make that feeling trigger some other behavior that you choose. The things I used were to read 20 pages of a book tie up leaders for fishing or if when I was at work just finish some other specific task. Might sound dumb but it worked for me. If you can completely distract your brain for 3-5 minutes all or at least the worst of it passes. The key for me was learning to let the craving tell me to remember to do the other thing before giving too much attention to the craving itself. After a week or so the cravings diminish greatly."
"The ONLY thing a cigarette does, besides attempted murder, is create a void that asks for another... Breaking this cycle and understanding how my mind had warped this basic truth into something legitimate was an eye opening experience. It allowed me to experience my quit as a third party to my minds struggle with the eradication of the addiction."
"After 45 years smoking and countless attempts to quit and also countless remedy's,tricks,and dollars spent on lastest greatest smoking cessation gimmicks...Good ol COLD TURKEY is the only way to go and then stay stopped..I haven't smoked in 3 years...That does not mean I don't think about it and probably will for the rest of my life..however it does get easier as time goes by I promise...I truly wish ya the best..quitting smoking is the greatest gift you will give yourself...EVER!! Especially if you are still young and healthy...Dont wait till the damage is done like some of us (can't happen to me hard heads) out here."
Pick up a vape
"I switched to e-cigs, but kept my habit the same.  That is, I would go outside to smoke, even when it was cold, or at a bar, whatever, and I only used the e-cigs, no more regular cigarettes.  With the e-cig, there was no way to know when I was ""done"" smoking, so I would just hang out for a bit, puffing on it, until I got bored or wanted to go back in or whatever.  The number of times I would go out, and the length of time I was out there, gradually got less and less.  Within a month or two I was completely done with smoking, and I haven't relapsed since, which has been about 8 years or so."
"Juul.  I know it’s not really “quitting” because I’m vaping nicotine, but holy fuck if I’m not healthier after not having a cig since March.  I’ve tried a bunch of different stuff over the years (patch, vape, gum, lozenge) but none of them worked."
"Though e cigs have their own health concerns, I was able to use them to quit, because I could take a puff at any moment without needing to smoke an entire cigarettes worth of nicotine, and yet they were not pleasurable enough for me to keep doing it long term.  One day I just said meh I don't need it."
Ginger chew candies are great for knocking out the craving that creeps up in the back of your mouth.  You know the one. 
"I stopped saying that I had quit, and started thinking of myself as a smoker who takes breaks. The breaks became longer, and my self esteem didn’t have to plummet if I had a smoke or two. I don’t have to count days from zero all over again. 
In addition I was helped in a huge way by vaping.
I don’t smoke (tobacco) anymore. "
"I gave up smoking cigarettes when my first child was expected.  I ended up just smoking tobacco in other ways - the odd cigar, but mostly lots of joints. Like 3 or 4 a night. (European, we make joints with tobacco).
I tried to give up a few times and I gave up for Lent a few times, but I was an addict.
The solution for me was a paradigm shift, not a method.  I did not try and give up smoking, I became an ex smoker.
I used to have sex with pretty girls, now I am married and that is not something I do.  yes it might be fun, but it is binary NOT SOMETHING I DO.
The same is true of tobacco - it is something I do not do.  Think of it like being a vegan (I am not) or being allergic to peanuts.  It is not a struggle (although i miss it) it is just something which is not for me.
I do not really know how to verbalise the shift in mindset here, but it worked."
"I started to quit one month ago and for me it's just a one day challenge. I mean, I'm just focus on not smoking during the current day, tomorrow we will see. And step by step, it's been a month and starting to feel a bit better "
"I quit cold turkey but I didn't like it for a long time anymore before I quit. My partner wanted to quit and started vaping, slowing lowing the nicotine intake every some what months, eventuelly reached 0 nicotine and than quit with vaping as wel"
Dipping. I hate it but its a lot cheaper than nicorrette and since I absolutely loathe it I can easily give it up. I use it as a step down while substituting more and more gum. 
"1.) Moved into my own place, no roommates casually smoking around me to normalize it. If I was smoking it was purely my own intent and not a casual social thing we’re all doing. This helped.
2.) Started dating a non-smoker. Cigarette breaks were limited to times when I wasn’t around her. This significantly reduced triggers.
BONUS) just remembered, had a friend who I told he could take photos of me smoking to post on social media, because for the most part my Facebook was clean of any smoke photos as my grandparents and younger siblings would feel weird seeing that and the pressure of those photos made me uncomfortable.
3.) Got caught trying to buy cigarettes by a coworker after telling them 20 minutes prior that I was gonna quit that day. It embarrassed me enough to stay off for about 4 days.
4.) Girlfriend had a good job, I had food stamps. She set up weekly reward incentives (learned from Freakinomics, financial rewards are a bigger incentive than the actual success) of a specialty soda from my hometown, luxury coffees and beers and a final prize a PS3 (which I would lose if started smoking again).
So basically, the stars aligned for about 6 months in a row and I was able to quit with the help of circumstance. 
The real mental game I had to play was being at bars with friends who smoke, and not joining them for a cigarette. I got real used to standing around people who were smoking, but I don’t know how I did it besides telling myself it’s ok to look weird not smoking.
I also found a coffee in my area that described itself as having nodes of tobacco and I mentally told myself it was like a cigarette replacement and I would enjoy that as a “smoke break”.
Also began eating a lot of chocolate and beer to fill the void. Probably gained about 10 pounds that year from increase in appetite and replacement vices. "
Nicotine gum is working for me.
"Sugar free gum (Extra, etc).
Stop going out with smoker friends for a year or more, or at least, don't go into situations with them where you used to smoke.
Exercise more.
I tried to quit for years and only succeeded when I moved 45 minutes away for work and hardly ever saw my friends, who were all smokers."
I chewed on cinnamon sticks whenever I got a craving. They feel like a cigarette and have a little flavor. Plus they are hollow inside. I also ate frozen grapes which helped for some reason. I quit cold turkey and never went back. 
Chantix worked really well for me. 3 month program where you can smoke during the program. I completely lost all desire to smoke within 2 weeks. Some people experience side effects (night terrors among others) by I didn't have any issues. Haven't had a cig in almost 10 years.
"Chantix.    Destroyed my job, put me on edge, gave me a god complex, felt like I had the energy of a thousand suns, but hey, kicked a 20 year habit, no cravings.
&#x200B;
Chantix works if you don't actually have to be the person you were before you took it for awhile.  If you need to be that responsible, clear thinking person, who isn't on a crusade to ""never back down, never surrender"" over everything and challenge your boss to fire your 'cock blocking assistant' maybe try one of these other methods."
Cold turkey has consistently shown to be the most effective way. Honestly if you get past a week the physical craving is gone. And after six months the psychological is pretty much gone. 
"Smoke-free here for 2 years now. I had alot of help from taking Chantix but the biggest thing was accepting it as a change of habit, emotionally, socially and physically.
Excercise, sleep and lots of fluids to help with the physical withdrawal symptoms.
Mindfulness, or grounding technqiues to help with the mental/emotional stress or withdrawal. Journaling also helps with tracking the positive effects that will gradually show up. Just remember to take it one day at a time with your emotions.
Lastly, this is crucial unfortantely; avoid social situations where you know you can borrow a cigarette from someone or where you know will be surrounded by smokers. 
Even if you relapse, try again and again. It took me 4 tries before I finally made it past 4 months of being smoke free; I'm a lot less stressed, more productive, have a little more cash and smell good lol."
"Consider yourself a non-smoker now amd don't beat yourself up when you relapse. Know that its going to be a fight, but one that you are going to win."
"Use your newfound budget to repaint your whole house if you smoke inside.
Trust me, as the child of someone who chained 1.5 packs per day, the walls were *yellow* when I moved out, they weren't when I moved in."
"go to your doctor and get champix, i went from 30+ a day to 0 in 3 days without cravings"
Mental conditioning. You have to believe 100% that cigarettes are SHIT.
Vaping definitely helps. Eventually you get tired of vaping and then you are free again. 
"Crippling existential dread about the meaninglessness of life and the cruel finality of death.
Also a really low nicotine e-cig for a few months was super helpful. "
"I listened to the audiobook of Allen Carr’s Stop Smoking, and it made all the difference. I needed to understand how the addiction was working in order to fight the urge and stay away. I quit before the audiobook was finished and never picked one up again. I celebrated five years this past May."
"I’ve tried weening myself off of them and setting dates and all that, but ended up failing. The only thing that worked for me was quitting cold turkey. Was just randomly having a smoke break at work one day and quit mid cigarette. Just looked at the cigarette, said  out loud “I don’t want to smoke anymore. I quit” and grabbed the packs I had in my toolbox and gave them to a guy I worked with. Got the strangest look from the guy too lol. I’ve smoked once since then and it has been about 6 years. Probably not amazing advice and may not work for everybody, but it worked for me. "
"If you’re not fully committed to quitting, don’t bother. You will just use any excuse you can come up with to rationalize having “just this one”. "
"Don't go into gas stations. Period.
Gas stations are pretty much the only place I ever bought cigarettes. Going in to pay for gas was basically just an excuse to also grab a pack or two. Honestly, there's no *real* reason for me to go inside of a gas station. I don't drink soda, eat candy, or have any interest in anything else in there. It's hard to go in and pay and just stare at that wall of cigarettes .
When I stopped doing that I was far less tempted to buy just one more pack."
"Just do it. Don’t plan. Don’t set a date. And do it cold turkey, otherwise you’re just replacing one source of nicotine with another and ultimately prolonging the process. Weed helps too. "
"Instead of smoking, don't smoke.  NEXT."
"Have some self discipline. If you slip up and buy a pack, when you light the first one up and start feeling guilty, through the rest of the pack in the trash immediately. Don’t turn one mistake into twenty. "
"This isn't the answer a lot of people are looking for but it worked for me after being a pack and a half a day smoker for years. Be aware that you need to both break a physical addiction as well as the mental addiction to the habits that you have developed.
The best way to quit smoking is to quit smoking. 
Vapes, patches, gums, extend your addiction and after a few weeks/months of your cravings not going away you'll get discouraged and go right back to the pack because you only tried to address the physical side. I use the word BREAK intentionally because that's what you have to do. You need to BREAK the habit, not ease yourself out of it.
Educate yourself on the symptoms of withdrawal and the timeline of how they go away and managing them becomes much easier. 
Tomorrow morning don't have a cigarette. Next time you have an urge... don't have a cigarette. It gives you a headache? Take an advil. Your mood starts fly all over the place? Take a walk. Understand that after a week when you wake up without a smokers cough you'll still have a lot of other symptoms but be happy you made it that far... and don't have a cigarete.
"
"I was never a heavy smoker, like 10 cigarettes a day at the very most.  To quit, I used the patch.  Several failed attempts with the gum, chantix (omg my stomach!), and other things like toothpicks, etc..  I started with the level 2 patch for three months, then moved to the level 1 patch for three more months, and then because I couldn't go without - I started cutting the level 1 patch into quarters.  After a few weeks of this, I was an ex-smoker - this happened in 2007."
"It’s been about 8 1/2 years now cold turkey.  It was -40 and I wanted to be warm, I only smoked outside.
Never picked it back up because the worst of it was during Christmas and I was busy.  It slipped my mind and I just never picked it back up.  The smell is enough to keep me away now.
Good luck to you!"
"Try to rewire your thoughts so that not having a cigarette becomes the reward. We all know that cigarettes are enjoyable because they exploit the reward mechanisms in your brain. When you crave one and make a decision to not act on that craving, give yourself a mental pat on the back for making that responsible decision. When you have your next craving 45 seconds later, do it again. Try to keep it so that not having a cigarette is a good thing instead of just another thing stressing you out."
"Associate the act with something you aren't planning on doing anymore. So stop smoking during breakfast or lunch or whatever and associate only smoking at a specific place, like your job. I did this and then when I quit the job I quit the smokes too. Cold turkey never looked back."
"Never smoke, ever. 
I “quit” numerous times before finally getting it right. There are many things you can do to help ease the suckiness, distractions, etc, but the thing you need most IMO is resolve. 
 A friend at the time had gone through AA recently and I asked him how he gave up alcohol and he said that he just told himself he was never going to drink, no excuses. Bad day, death in the family, good day, I’ve been good for XX weeks so I can probably have just one...the list is endless. 
Basically my problem was that I kept convincing myself I had my addiction under control. I never did and never could, so once I realized that the only way to quit was to never, EVER, EVER FUCKING EVER smoke even one teeny cigarette, I was able to do it. It took me 22 years but it’s been 16 years now. "
"This is what worked for me:
Download QuitNow! App. 
Buy Vape. 
Break up with crazy stressful ex   
Smoke free 2 years!"
Eat baby carrots.  Unlike some snacks there’s no salt and you will get sick before they make you fat.  But great to give your hand s and mouth something to do. 
Listen to music you can sing too!
"I laid out a plan for quitting. Before quitting I went on the American Cancer Society website and American Heart/Lung Association to really learn about smoking related cancers. I read all their advice for quitting and what studies showed in terms of long-term quitting success. I learned that nicotine levels return to normal after about 1 week of quitting, after that, it was all mental. This empowered me. I learned that smoking can double the risk of infertility issues for women and my biggest dream in life was to be a mom, so this became my mantra and motivation.
I picked a Quit Date (March 20, 1999), switched to cigarettes I hated for the last month, began to wean down the number of cigarettes to the bare minimum (my two hardest cigarette times to quit were before bed and driving to work), I bought low-cal candy to distract my mouth at craving times, bought healthy snacks to eat instead and bought a gym membership to combat any weight gain. It is hard to smoke and run at the same time.
On my Quit Day I asked for family and friend support, took it easy and rewarded myself with a manicure. Every day the first week I gave myself a small reward, this wired my brain for positive association with not smoking. After the first week of success, I rewarded myself every Friday if I hadn’t smoked all week. I would get a new book, go for a hike, get a massage, a dinner out, coffee with a friend, etc. All healthy and happy rewards. 
It worked. I’ve never looked back."
"You have to commit yourself. You have to want it. You cannot do it for your spouse, your kids, your parents, your pets...., you have to do it for YOU. You have to want it. "
Will power. 
Quitting is a decision you make for yourself. It will never be easy. I haven’t had a cig in over a year but I still crave them all the time. Smell a cig? Want one. Drink some whiskey? Want one. Bang my wife? Want one. But I don’t smoke them anymore because I decided not to. 
"Just do it. It's not that hard. At least not as hard as everyone says it is. If you want to do it, you'll do it.  
Reduce to quit. First day half the amount you smoke then a couple days later half that. Before you know it you'll have it."
Dip all of your cigarettes in pcp 
"I used nicotine gum, would buy really shitty cigars to smoke about 1/4 of after dinner for the first week.  It has to be undesirable or it will just be a replacement.
I've been quit a little over a year at this point, it sucks.  I want one every.....single.....day, and about once a month that's all I want for an entire day.  But the longer it goes the easier it is.
The smell has started to become sort of repulsive as well, except for every now and then someone will fire up that good one out of a pack.
Moral of the story is, it's not fun, and you're still gonna want to smoke after,  but for me I'm far to stubborn to go  back.  After as much as it sucked quitting"
"# You have to want to quit.
That thing they say, ""You have to want to quit."" is not just BS. It's the biggest part of it. My wife has been the only person who has asked me to quit. 
She wanted me to quit before we got married. I stopped for about a week.
She asked again for me to quit before our son was born, I stopped for a week, bought an e-cig and two weeks later was smoking again.
I never smoked a lot, but then I got laid off in 2014 from my IT job, then started working as a utility locator (did that for about a year or so, now back in IT). Before, I could only go smoke on break and during lunch when I could get outside to do so. At the locator job, I could smoke in my truck, smoke anytime I wanted. That new found freedom, plus the stress of literally losing 50% of my previous pay, bills, etc......I literally went from half a pack a day to a pack a day in two months. Wife started to notice and wasn't happy. She'd say something about it, I'd get annoyed and go smoke another one or three. She finally quit asking me to quit.
I say all of that b/c I didn't want to quit, and that's why it never worked. One day, I just decided that I couldn't smoke for the rest of my life. I always had a lot of reasons why I should quit (kids, wife didn't like it but tolerated it, health, Dr. said it was a good idea, commercials said it was a good idea, even more sexy time with wife if I didn't smell and taste like an ashtray, etc.) but none of it really mattered until sometime in June of 2016. I don't know what changed my mind, but all of a sudden those reasons made sense and I wanted to quit. It wasn't like I suddenly loved my wife and kids more, or I cared more about my health and the health of those around me. I don't know exactly how to explain it, just one day I was like, *I want to stop smoking so that I can do ""things"" for ""people"" I care about.*
I used the patches. Bought them over the counter at Wal-Mart. I slipped a couple of times during the first two weeks, but smoked my very last cigarette on June 15, 2016. It gets easier as time goes on. I also developed a new found love for sunflower seeds. You will gain weight. As a utility locator, I walked 6-8 miles a day. I weighted 170lbs when I stopped smoking, and within a year I weighed 190lbs. Now that I sit on my ass all day again, I weigh 210....I need to exercise more.

I still work with people who smoke, but the funny thing is, now I don't like the smell of it. Before, I'd see someone smoking IRL, or on TV or in a game and I'd have to go have one. Now, I'm not really disgusted by it, but I don't have that urge anymore. I see someone smoking now and think, *damn, I wasted a lot of money.*
According to the app I have on my phone, I quit June 15, 2016 @ 00:00. Based on a pack a day @ $5.50/pack - I've not smoked 16,990 cigarettes and saved $4,672.28.
I actually didn't start smoking until I was about 30. Just had a bunch of friends and family who still smoked...my sister, my aunt, an uncle, both grandfathers, one grandmother, two bro-in-laws.....just got tired of being out of the cool crowd. This was ***AFTER*** my grandmother died of lung cancer when I was a kid and my grandfather (her husband) had a tracheotomy due to throat cancer that he developed. They both smoked unfiltered Camels for 50 years. I know, stupid decision. 
My sister quit a year before I did b/c she got pregnant, and my Dad quit when I was 4 or 5 b/c I told him that when I grew up, I wanted to smoke just like he did. I used to go outside with him and play on the porch while he smoked. He said that when I told him that, he had literally just opened that pack, smoked that one cigarette and then walked in and threw the rest away. He said that was the one thing that made him want to quit. He quit cold turkey and never touched another one.
&#x200B;
TL;DR - You aren't going to quit until you want to. Please find a reason to want to, OP. :)"
"Talk to your bank account, I live in Canada so ciggs are insanely expensive. I did the math, i spent 11k on ciggs in one year. I went pale and quit."
"Not from personal experience, and this may be extreme to some, but after doing LSD, my boyfriend quit smoking cold turkey. Apparently it works in that way for some. "
This sounds dumb but try to visualize yourself as a non-smoker. I quit 30 years ago back when restaurants has smoking and non-smoking sections. Instead of saying it didn't matter I would insist on the non-smoking section even before I had fully quit. If necessary become judgmental and feel superior to smokers even before you quit.
Get rid of your lighters. 
Don't count the days since your last on until you are sure you are past a month it puts less stress on you
"I quit smoking on August 4, 2017. The way I did it was a combination of vaping (buying an actual vape, not a juul or anything like that), and then catching pneumonia (unrelated). Vaping was going good...I started at 12mg, then went down to 6 mg, then to 3... then I caught pneumonia in January, and gave it up entirely. "
Chantix is what worked for me. Follow the directions. I used it about a month or more before I quit. Then I used it for another 6 months or more. When I quit I still had cravings  but they were manageable. I have been nicotine free for about a year and a half.  Without it I would have made it about 15 minutes. 
"Water, carry a water bottle everywhere.  It satisfies the oral fixation which is the secondary addiction aside from nicotene.  Also as a smoker your addiction centre converts your body's normal signals for thirst and hunger into compelling you to satisfy the urges to have a cigarette instead.   Water also helps satisfy most of these urges when you quit so that you don't convert all the urges to satisfy with eating snacks which makes most gain weight as a result.  Most people don't drink enough water but especially smokers as it saps the hydration from your body as well.  Water."
"I quit cold turkey 5 years ago, it sucked but what helped me was quitting after thanksgiving. I hate the cold weather so as it got colder that first winter, it actually helped me fight the urge to go outside and smoke one. By the summer I had been so used to not having one I didn’t slip up and have been smoke free since "
"Smoker for 35 years and all of a sudden I kept thinking they tasted like poison.
I didn't want them to taste that way---
I fucking loved smoking.
I mean, I hoped to quit somehow one day, but..
No matter how hard I tried to smoke,( and I REALLY wanted my fucking cigarettes!!) they kept tasting and feeling like they were poisoning me.
I'm not crazy, btw, just saying.
Maybe you could manifest that thought somehow."
"Whenever I craved one, I would just take some really really deep breaths to remind myself how important it was for me to stop. It became easier as my lung capacity started to build. Also, it helps if you get out of your routine. Smoking as a habit was (for me at least) 95% routine, 5% enjoyment. "
"If you smoke weed and you’re trying to quit cigarettes, smoke blunts.
I smoked a half pack a day and I was able to quit by smoking a couple of blunts throughout the day. Just roll a couple of swisher sweets up at the beginning of your day, smoke on one until you get your fix, put it out and relight it when you need it again. 
I did this for about 2 to 3 months before I switched over to rolling joints, now I won’t touch a cigarette(it’s been 10 years since I last smoked)."
"Smoked for about 7 years.....started using those Blu e-Cigs (before all this vape craze these days) for a while which were pretty nice.  Started hearing info that these were possibly attributed to the same system that those fog machines were using and I immediately stopped using them.  At that time I had already not been smoking regular cigarettes for about 2 months or so, so I basically just quit cold turkey from there on out and haven't smoked since....that was about 2010."
"I quit more or less cold turkey. My change was a night of bar hopping. I had a cigarette before we got in an Uber and apparently that just made my drunkeness so much worse. Fiance made sure several times in the car that I was still alive/breathing. Spent the next few hours hugging the toilet. Worst hangover ever. Somehow, that led to me quitting. (I also don't really barhop anymore. Keeps me from having too much.)"
"Smoked for 11 years.  I honestly couldn't quit until it was for just me.  I started to realize how bad they tasted.  I would make a mental note of it. Then I started to notice the faint smell it left all over everything.  Eventually time between cigars would get longer and longer, until one day I went to hold one up to my face and I was so repulsed by it I just couldn't anymore.  I'm at 7 months clean so far."
"Leverage a change of surroundings to kick the habit. If you are moving to a new city or a new home, use this event to quit. I noticed that most of my urges were habit related - light up while waking to the bus stop, light up on the balcony before going to sleep, light up when you start arranging the books. When I moved to a new city, I quit. Since the environment was new, I was not doing most of the things that I was doing out of habit earlier. There was no walk to the bus stop, no balcony, no bookshelf. Without the triggers, it was easier to resist. Plus, there were so many othee things to do which took my mind off the urge to smoke. 
Hope this helps someone!
PS: Was a smoker for 9 years, quit 7 years ago."
"You just have to quit. Put out that cigarette and don't light up another. Think of yourself as a nonsmoker, not an ex-smoker, not an occasional smoker -- a nonsmoker. Cravings suck, but they go away. And every time you overcome a craving, the weaker the associations between the craving and the crave-inducing activity (drinking, billiards, band practice, whatever) become. After a couple years, ten years, maybe forever, you will still have cravings, but they will be so infrequent it's actually kind of interesting from a psychological perspective when they present themselves. While unmistakably a cigarette craving, it will feel so unusual at that point that you can easily isolate and ignore it. "
"For me it took a few tries. First a week or 2. Then a month or 2 then I just stopped. I got into the routine having a cigarette at work breaks. While driving etc so I just learned to find a new habit in those times. Overall it was the decision of realizing how sick I felt, the bad taste and smell that I carried. "
Get pissed off about it
Don't start
"Not sure I'd reccomend it, but I picked out a day, and the night before, I picked up 2 packs of Marlboro Reds and one pack of filterless Camels.  I went out drinking and chainsmoked all 3 packs.  I woke up so sick, I couldn't even look at a cigarette, and that went on for 3 days or so.  By the time I felt better, I had already gone 3 full days without smoking, so I just kept going.  10 years later, I still don't smoke anymore."
"i’ve tried every method and the one that finally did it was simply eliminating 2 cigarettes a day from how many I smoked over the course of several weeks till i was at zero. i started at a a pack a day and every week smoked 2 less cigarettes a day. when i hit the week of zero a day I did not use patches or gum. I found both of those methods just made my addiction linger. 
the other thing that really helped was a genuine desire to quit but keeping in mind I was going to fail at quitting. it takes the average person 5 attempts to successfully quit smoking, it took me 7 and that’s ok. the important thing to remember if you relapse is it’s not the end of the world and you will be able to try again whenever you are ready. don’t beat yourself up, take your time. you’ll do the thing when you are prepared. "
"I never really quit.  I ran out of smokes in October 2009, and just haven't been to the store to buy more.  I tried everything before that.  The patch, gum, pills.  The only thing that worked for me was to just....stop.  "
"I have a couple that worked for me, I hope they work for you too:
Figure out if it's an oral fixation, an addiction, or just a fidget. Once that's figured out it can get a little easier, my cigarette smoking was a fidget, so I just gave myself something else to fidget with, I'm kinda adhd.
If you can tolerate it, chew sugar free gum, it can help with fidgeting and get some of that urge out.
If munch something, try to keep it low calorie, this is how people gain weight when they quit.
Change up your routine, if you don't have those ""scheduled"" cigarette breaks then it helps with ""not finding time to smoke"".
Try with your might to avoid triggers, for me, the hardest one was lighting up in the car on the way somewhere. That's hard to do, instead I kept a pen in my center console so I could fiddle with that in traffic.
Exercise, it's pretty exhilarating when you get done at the gym or coming in from a run and your chest isn't aching.
Make a little note to remind yourself why. This was a lpt I had come across one day in reddit. I made a note on my reasons and made it the background for my phone. Every time I saw the homescreen it was a reminder why.
Just remember, relapses happen, don't beat yourself up. Some places have tobacco cessation assistance, if you find yourself needing it, don't be afraid to reach out. 
I wish you all the success in your journey to quit! "
"If you’re a big smoker when you drink, you’re going to have to quit drinking for while too.   When I quit smoking, I was semi OK at first, but first beer I had I relapsed, knew I couldn’t drink but not smoke."
"The newer pod vapes like the Juul and the Juno are probably the best for people getting off of smoke, I'd say. "
Just stop smoking. That's it. Just stop.  It's the only way.
Read the book. It’s called “The Easy Way to Stop Smoking” by Allen Carr. I quit a year and a half ago after reading it. You keep smoking while you read it but by the end of it you’re done. Forever. Best decision I ever made. 
"For anybody reading this,  parents and others with friends and family. Just stop, really. My girlfriend lost her Dad to cancer very likely due to smoking. Just stop, it's hard losing a loved one like that , it's no fun when they pump you full of pain medicines and  if your lucky die quick or very slowly and then the loved ones around you live in pain all because you wasted time and money on a stupid cancerous stick and now they have to fight with depression and nightmares and haunting images. Just because you feel like you need it."
"Find something that you KNOW causes you to smoke out of stress or anxiety, and use that as fuel to quit in spite of it. Be determined that you are NOT going to allow this ""whatever"" to influence your life anymore in a negative way... For me, it was my ex wife. We had been separated for a while, and going through a bitter divorce. I was already a pack-a-day smoker, and she knew she was getting under my skin every damn day. I went to about 2, almost 3 packs a day for about 6 months. On November 16th, 2013 she had hung up on me during a phone call about my visitation rights with our children. I was pissed off. Big time. I reached for my pack of cigarettes, walked out on the balcony of my hotel, and put one up to my lips. Just before lighting up I had a moment of clarity, and I said to myself: ""This is what you want, isn't it? You WANT me stressed out. You WANT my blood pressure to be sky high with the only coping mechanism I can find being an expensive carton of cigarettes... Well fuck you, bitch, I won't give you the god damn satisfaction!""
I haven't smoked a cigarette since, and I'm healthier and happier because of it. In spite of her.     "
Start by bringing cash If you go into a convenient store. So if you go and are only going to grab a drink bring only that amount of cash needed to get the drink. Don’t bring in more just in case of the temptation. 
"After the first 24 hours it gets easier. Find something to do with your hands, I bought a rubiks cube, my friend took up knitting."
Juul. It’s not much better but I’m at five months now.
"You know that feeling you get when you have a cigarette after not having one for a while?  That ""Aaaaaahhhh"" euphoric feeling?  That only happens because of the nicotine addiction being satisfied.  ""Just one"" will not give you that feeling.  You will not get that feeling unless you have a couple, become addicted again, and then satisfy that addiction.  Learning this helped me not fall into that trap, and still helps me today when I think about having just one."
Cold turkey. For the first 3 days find ways to keep yourself busy. Wethers its cleaning the house or whatever. Its those first 3 days that will cause relapses. Also avoid drinking for a little while.
"Go cold turkey. Have people in your life around you that hate smoking. Don't go to social scenarios that you typically end up smoking at (drinking with friends that smoke) for a month or 2. Do not have cigarettes laying around your home, vehicle, job etc.  Do not put a cigarette in your hand or mouth again without knowing it will ruin your streak and will totally start you up again. After about a month or 2 the smell will have you guessing how you ever breathed that shit in the first place.
Esit: Also most people don't know tabacco is radioactive from the radioactive lead and potassium the plant draws in while growing. The amont of radiation an average smoker absorbs in your lungs is 8 times the OSHA limit for radiation contamination clean up crew. Or twice that of an astronaut (the highest exposure of any job). Here's a video comparing the most radioactive places on Earth so you get an idea of what you're doing to yourself.

"Don't set yourself up for failure. Don't go into the gas station, theres almost no reason to ever do that, you don't need the gas station snacks and you will just tempt yourself with a purchase. Don't go near the aisle you can buy cigarettes in, no reason to be in that lane or near it and it will just tempt you. Don't go outside when your friends want to smoke, it will just tempt you and you're setting yourself up. IF you have someone in your life that has the time to hold you accountable that is setting yourself up for success. It takes willpower, theres no magic way to avoid that..but you can still make it easier on yourself by not being around it. Also replacing it with a healthier habit can do wonders, you'll start to look forward to the new habit instead of looking forward to your next smoke. I do little puzzles on my phone instead "
"After trying everything over the years, the only thing that finally worked for me was Chantix.  Smoke free for almost eight years now--rarely if ever even think about smoking and I was almost two packs a day when I stopped."
"Exercise and chewing gum worked for me... its hard, especially at first. You will need all the willpower you can possibly muster, especially if you've been smoking a lot and for a long time.
The first 72 hours will be the hardest. All cravings will eventually pass.
I also found that downloading an app like I am Sober to track how long its been is helpful. I'm just over 8 months smoke free now and have saved $1600 
But the most important thing is actually wanting to quit. Like for real. You gotta want it"
Substituted ciggies for exercise. I suggest finding a good substitute that you can rely on when you are feeling the craving.
"This is probably going to be burried, but i hope you read it OP. I smoked a pack a day for 8 years, tried a bunch of stuff, nicorete quickmist did it for me. It's still hard, but that shit works "
"First off, you HAVE to want to. By the time I quit, I was so desperate to kick the habit that I didn't struggle much. I bought a box of nicorette gum and a box of Equate patches. I got the highest milligram of both, and I used a patch a day for a week, then instead of buying the lower mg, I just cut them in half, and then quarters. With the patches, they take a while to work, so it's best to put them on at night. That was where I struggled, because I liked showering in the morning and had to switch to night. I chewed the gum with the patches, which you're not supposed to, but it helped with sudden urges. Then, after I quit the patches I chewed the gum for another week or so. Have no desire to smoke again, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind often. The key is wanting to quit, even download a quit tracker app to see how much money you're saving and how much life you're getting back - that helps for a lot of people."
Know the head game. I quit cold turkey after reading The Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr.  I didn't find it incredibly difficult once I understood and could recognize the withdrawal.  
I ended up having to take chantix to actually quit. Also. Not being around other smokers much helped too! And actually wanting to quit!
Everytime i feel like a cigarette i just remind myself its the addiction that is asking for it and i will get nothing but bad breath and cancer out of it.
Hard cardio did it for me! I took up boxing. You won’t want to sacrifice your lungs or any of the progress you’ve made for a cigarette. 
Start running or take up a sport that is quite demanding. The pain you will feel from how fucked up your lungs have got and the shame of getting gassed out fast will help remind you why you want to quit and as you get fitter it will make you not want to ruin the progress made by turning back. 
Drink a glass of water every time i wanted to smoke. It really helped. 
Don't hang out with smokers. 
"I went the medical route with welbutrin. It was amazing. Less then 4 weeks later, I was off smokes and I've never gone back. Four years clean now. "
"Eat, it will lessen the cravings.  You will gain a little weight, but it's worth it.  Then the cravings will be gone in a couple of days."
"I got that quit smoking app and it really motivated me to stay smoke free.  It counts all the cigs you would have had since your last one and tracks the recovery of your heart, lungs etc. Seeing that I have not smoked 560 cigarettes in the last month really put it into perspective for me.  Think about smoking 560 cigarettes! Disgusting, right?
Edit: spelling"
"I had to quit my associations at the same time too. 
I pretty much quit drinking since I couldn’t drink without smoking. 
Stopped going to the coffee shop where I would hangout and chain smoke. 
Same thing they tell any recovering drug addict being reintroduced into the world. "
Cold turkey and smelling black pepper essential oil when I had cravings. Tried many other ways over the years and this did it for me.  
two words juul gang
"My mom quit cold turkey after finding out a friend of mine was allergic or super sensitive to cigarette smoke and my mom had driven a few of us to the mall for my birthday. My friend coughed the whole time but I (and my mom) didn’t find oh until months later why. I was humiliated and so was my mom. New Year’s Day she just quit, never looked back. Unlike my dad, who tried the gum, medicine (Chantix?), dum dums, etc. He finally quit for good (I hope) after having a heart attack a few years ago. "
Breeze 2 vaporizer with nicotine salts. Took about 2 months before i didnt like cigarettes anymore 
"There is no magic secret. There is no one amazing trick. You suck it up and accept that your life is going to be worse for a week. Your going to feel weird. You might even feel a little sick from time to time. After that week you will feel better. After a month you will feel euphoric about your achievement and just how much better you feel. After 6 months you wont think about smoking much any more. You'll still be reminded from time to time but it wont be an everyday or even every week thought.
"
"Hypnosis. 
I smoked a pack and a half a day for 12 years. I had tried cold turkey, the patch and gum - they were all difficult and never managed to last. Hypnosis was easy and I haven’t bought a pack in 11 years."
"My doctor basicly scared the shit out of me at a visit, explained in detail what would happen. For some reason it really had an impact. Walked out and threw my pack away and havent touched it since."
"I smoked a pack a day for about 8 years and loved it.  I had always heard that even smoking like that for 10 years vastly increases your chances for lung cancer, and i told myself I would never get to 10 years.  I never tried to quit during those 8 years and I knew I had to do something or this would be for my entire life.
What worked for me is actually deciding fully to quit, and letting people know of my intentions (pretty much so that they were there to give me shit if I fucked up).  I never claimed I was “going to” quit, I just kept all that to myself until I actually made the decision that I don’t want to smoke anymore.  I made it a point not to tell anyone until I was sure.  Then, I told people I was quitting, and got rid of the rest of the pack I still had.  That was 5 years ago and haven’t smoked one since.  I had a little temptation for about two days ( every time I ate/woke up/smoked weed/etc). After those two days, they started smelling bad to me when other people would smoke around me.  Then I didn’t really want them anymore.  "
"Find something you like more than smoking.
For me, it was rock climbing and hiking. Sure, I could still do those things as a smoker, but it's a lot easier doing those things as a non-smoker."
"Ahh the bitch of quitting smoking. I've done all form of nicotine--chew, gums, patches, cigars all of it but finally put my last cigarette out April 21, 1986. 
Now I vape and cutting that down too. I'm old and have wrestled with nicotine a long time and even tried hypnosis. Problem with hypnosis was the 'hypno-therapist' had a heavy smokers cough and continued hacking all through my suggestions! Hilarious but true and it didn't work either. In 86, I came late to a ""stop-smoking meeting"" and they locked the doors to late-comers and I was so pissed off and bummed, I drew a circle around the date on the calendar, wrote in the year and quit. Cold turkey and stayed off for 2 years and then started with chewing tobacco. Bad plan that one, as dentist pleaded with me to quit because oral cancer is FAST, deadly and results, as he said, ""horrifying."" Quit that 5 years ago and vaping ever since. But reading about vaping here has now upset my 'plan' because I've noticed it does affect my wind/breath when diving and running. Scuba diving in Hawaii recently, and I burned through my air faster than all other divers and I wondered how that is possible because I vape. Because it does plug up the lungs, that's how. Now after reading all these posts, I know I got to get off of vaping too. Thanks for posting the query, and good luck to all. 
Carr's book didn't help me but his line is memorable: ""with cigarettes, 1 is too many and a million not enough."" "
"Just don’t smoke that one cigarette.  Not don’t smoke forever,  that’s too big,  just don’t smoke that one.  That one your mind is trying  to trick you into right now.  Maybe later.  Maybe tomorrow.  Maybe New Years But not this one.  Not right now.
Embrace what I call your addiction voice.  That voice in your head that tries to convince you to smoke.  It’s a smarter more creative version of you.  “If you quit 10 years,  your risk factors go back to normal.  So we’re only 32... we could quit at 40 and still be ok”...  “. Day 3.  Look how easy this was.  We could just smoke now and do this again next year.  We’ve proven we can do it”.... “ok great job.  Two weeks clean.  We can celebrate with a smoke.  Since were non smokers now,  we can be one of those occasional smokers”... “no problem if you just bum one... as long as you don’t buy a pack... you’re 2 months in now-  certainly established as a non-smoker”
Don’t fight that stuff or you’ll constantly be in the traditional “will power” cycle and you’ll lose to your addiction voice.  Embrace it.  Yea... good point.  Sure enough.  Yep.  All of that is fine and all those mental conversations are fine as long as.... the answer is never let’s smoke one cigarette.  Not when drinking,  not on a special occasion,  not for a rationalized experiment.  You can do anything else.  Treat us like your conservative Facebook uncle.  You can agree with your addiction voices conclusion that the whole thing is a made up Chinese plot and smoking isn’t even bad for you.  You can agree that smoking is just the right thing for you and plenty of smokers live to 100.  As long as you don’t smoke a cigarette.
You’re an addict.  For real.  It’s not a lessor or more casual ailment.  I was amazed the first time I ever quit for a few months that when I smoked one cigarette I woke up the next morning almost completely just as addicted and craving  as I had been when I was a full time smoker.  It faded but was easier only because my habits had changed.  My addiction hadn’t.
I believe in various types of nicotine replacement but don’t really believe in an organized substitute like gum or candy or sunflower seeds.  You’re just promoting the same behavior.  Talk to your addiction voice, embrace it and reject the immediate need to solve that issue.  It can always wait until tomorrow.
And Chantix.  Chantix is amazing. (I had to quit twice-  once for 6 years,  then a 1 year relapse and quit again 6 months ago.  Second time with Chantix.)"
"I quit back in 1999 and never looked back.
The things that worked for me:
* Convincing myself that I hated the smell
* Avoided being around smokers - This one was pretty hard as it involved not visiting or hanging out with any friends for about half a year. The only smoker I couldn't avoid was my wife, who quit with me but didn't make it.
* Got a different car that didn't stink
* Convinced my wife to not smoke inside the house
It'll be 20 years in January. My wife quit a few times, most notably during pregnancy. She switched to e-cigarettes about 6 years ago. I'm not sure if it is any healthier but it sure helps with the smell. I have wondered that if e-cigarettes were available in 1999, would I have successfully quit?
To this day, I still catch myself reaching inside my jacket when leaving a building in wintertime."
"Stop buying them.
Seriously. I used to smoke nearly a pack a day. One day I decided that ~$12 a pack (yay canada) was too expensive and that I'd only be a mooch and bum smokes from friends. Eventually they got sick if me asking and I was enjoying the extra money saved so i just kinda...stopped. havent had one in 4 years."
"my dad turned to sugar free popsicles, it's been more than fifteen years since his last cigarette but now he eats like 8 popsicles every night"
Have a nicotine reduction plan. Don't let one relapse jeopardize nyour quitting. Tell people around you are quitting and to not give you cigarettes. Have someone to talk to when it will get hard.
Find another habit that's less of a nuisance and easier to break. 
"If you're trying to quit, watch this short video. At least once a week.
https://youtu.be/0TL2Vh7goJc"
"Don't beat yourself up for failing, just try again"
"My solution is entirely impractical, because it involves changing everything about your life until smoking doesn't fit into it anymore.
-Lost a job where I chainsmoked before, on breaks, and after. At later jobs I consciously made an effort to not include smoking into the new routine.
-Stopped going out and partying so much. Less late drinking led to less smoking.
-Moved in with my girlfriend (later my wife) who hated smoking, so I had to smoke less.
-Had a kid, which made quitting even more important.
-Rising cost. A pack of cigarettes costs like $10 where I live now.
All that and it still took me three years to fully quit."
"When you want to quit its easy.  Its hard when you don't want to quit, but feel like you should.  I'm not sure if that makes sense to everyone.  For me I tried quitting several times, all though I knew  really deep down I didn't want to.  When I really wanted to do it, I had my last smoke.  Gave my daughter my pack of cigarettes to throw away.  That was it, I was done.  Good luck.  Cheers"
"I used the patch successfully, along with some addiction cutting hints a close friend learned by getting off of pain killers.
You want to limit what you're trying to cut out of your life at once, people often mess up these things by trying to quit smoking, drinking, eating poorly, start exercising, etc all at once, and that's setting yourself up for failure.
So, the patch let me not worry about the physical side at first, and allowed me to focus on the habit.  I never bought a pack after I started the patch, but I did smoke maybe 3 cigarettes the first week (down from a pack to a pack and a half a day).  Never smoked again after that first week.  I kept my hands busy doing chores and whatever I could, and I drank a lot of water to help with the oral fixation.
For the patch, I went with the highest dosage I could, and just followed directions.  After about two weeks, I started to get extremely jittery and stepped down the dosage.  Keep the lower dosage for another two weeks, and after getting a similar jittery feeling, used the lowest dosage for a couple days.  By then, I was really over it and that was that."
Be to lazy to buy more packs when you run out
I quit a 30 year habit by vaping.  It really does work.  I had asthma so bad that I couldn't sleep through the night.  I told myself I would vape to cut down on smoking.  I tried the gas station ones and they are crap.  Have a vaping friend or a vape shop set you up.  The day I bought my vape was the last day I smoked.  It's been three years now.  I no longer need any asthma medication or an inhaler.  I smell like strawberry wherever I go.  You can even sneak one in the bathroom at a doctors appointment that's taking too long. 
Quit smoking 4 years ago and got a gym membership at the same time. Working out helps you sweat the nicotine out and for me personally it was a motivator to be healthy. It also helps prevent to potential weight gain that comes with quitting smoking. I smoked for 8 years. 
Wean off slowly until you are only smoking 1 maybe 2 a day after that quit buying them and try your hardest to not go back eventually cigarettes will taste gross to you but at the end of the day you really have to want to quit and it will suck a lot at times but remind yourself why you are doing it and the benefits of it.
"I found Wellbutrin was a life saver.  I smoked from the time I was a freshman in college (17) until my gynecologist told me (at 32) that I'd have to quit by the time I was 35 or she'd refuse to prescribe birth control.  So my regular doctor prescribed Wellbutrin for depression, because insurance wouldn't pay for it if it was only for smoking.  You take it for ten days, then quit smoking.  So on January 11, 1998, I stopped smoking. Never faltered at all. In fact, almost immediately, the smell of cigarette smoke was disgusting to me, like it had been before I started smoking. I can barely breathe when anyone smokes around me. 
And the bonus is that I realized I was actually chronically low-level depressed and I stayed on the Wellbutrin ever since. It was like it took a film of dinginess off my brain."
"1) wake up one morning not wanting to smoke
2) stop smoking
(though I do carry a pack with me to share with my friends or when I go out and want to socialize a bit more)"
"I was a pack a day smoker for about 9 years. I tried vaping, I tried gum, nicotine patches, etc.
Three years ago I thought I had gotten bronchitis for the third time & I decided to quit cold turkey. Haven't smoked since.
What helped most was an app called SmokeFree. You can enter in how much a pack of cigarettes costs, how many you smoke a day, and it calculates how much money you can save in a year and how much you've saved so far. It has a lot of other nifty features but opening the app and seeing I've saved about $4k so far is a good motivator to not pick it back up."
"Exercising and brushing my teeth/using mints worked pretty well for me. 
But, in complete, utter honesty, the last nail in the smoking coffin was getting so disgusted with myself that I really couldn't bear to smoke anymore. The brushing teeth often (between meals, after morning coffee/breakfast, before bed) really helped me feel disgusted with smoking, but it wasn't until I suddenly smoked a pack a day one time while I was drinking, and felt awful for days afterward that I finally quit cold turkey. "
"Accept that it's going to hurt for a week or two, and then you'll crave it for a long time, and then you put down your last butt and never buy another pack."
"Chantix. Chantix. I tried to quit for 1-2 years off and on — then I got prescribed Chantix and it was the best decision I ever made. I also chewed sunflower seeds for the oral fixation help through the first couple of weeks. 
A lot of people mention the nightmares or bad dreams from chantix. I experienced very “vivid” dreams, however never nightmares. 
I always see the Chantix commercials and actually believe the people because I know that it works. 
Good luck!"
I started vaping four years ago. I currently have not had a cig for that amount of time. I HOWEVER have a very impressive and expensive vape hobby.
"Auriculotherapy worked for me. A single visit to a chiropractor, $200, a little pep talk and some electrical stimulation of nerves on my ears, and I was done. Still can’t believe it worked, been over ten years now, not a single craving."
Switching to marijuana worked for me!
"I separated the mental addiction from the physical addiction.  While still smoking I rid myself of my mental addiction.  I purposely hated my actions of smoking, hiding, skulking around as a shameful smoker.  It took me a good year before I hated myself as a smoker so much, that when I finally quit, I only had to deal with the physical addiction. By breaking up the two, each was achievable on their own.  First, hate smoking and everything that it is; second, just stop smoking.  I smoked for 25 years and have not smoked in 3 now, with zero chance of ever going bank.  "
"Yoda and a trigger.
I just like to open with that.  For me, the trigger event was my son running outside to find me while I was hiding from my kids to have a smoke.  He wanted to know what I was doing and I could already tell he wanted to try it.  So I quit.  He wants to do everything I do, so it had to go.
Then I never thought about it as *trying* to quit.  Trying implies I allow the possibility of not being good enough to succeed at it.  I just quit.  Do, or do not.  There is no try."
"I vaped for a while with mixed success ended up just vaping more than smoking, but what really helped me quit was gum, sunflower seeds, and distracting myself with something new.   I used longboarding and exploring new music, but a few friends who also were quitting tried karate, going to the gym, going back to school, and giving their products to trusted friends and not buying cigarettes again.  They did this by paying at the pump, buying groceries at the furthest register from cigarettes, etc.  Hope I helped and good luck to you, the first few weeks are the hardest!"
"I switched to menthols for a bit and then when I got a craving, i had a mint. Worked perfectly. Been smoke free since 2013! "
Do it now. Not tomorrow. Not when you finish the pack. Now even after one last cigarette - there's nothing beautiful or poignant about the last stick of toxic fumes that damages your body. Just do it right now.
"Decide why you're quitting. Truly think about the health consequences. Don't you want to grow old with your family? Do you have or plan to have kids? Visit a nursing home and find someone that has an oxygen generator with canula in their nose 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Just walking to the mailbox could be very hard. Research emphysema for the symptoms and treatment. 
Don't do it for the money. 
Do it for life. 
Good luck! "
"Hot sauce. Like scorpion pepper hot sauce. Carry a bottle around with you and some toothpicks and coat the tip of a toothpick with Satan’s liquid fire and roll that delicious magma over your tongue anytime you get a craving. It resets your brain and creates a Pavlovian response to your cravings.

"I quit 15 years ago, I smoked for 25 years.  I used Zyban for about 8 or 9 days beforehand, and a month or so after.  I found that it took away the nicotine cravings, and left the habit for me to work on.  Some advice from a former boss that's worked for me is don't even have one cigarette, because that makes you a smoker again.  He went back and forth and eventually keeled over dead on a sidewalk while having a cigarette."
Never smoked never will. I hate smoking with a passion. My grandfather died from lung cancer caused from smoking before I ever got the chance to meet him. I went to his funeral days old. He never got to meet any of his grand children watch them grow up and do the things we have. Not only did he miss this he also hurt everyone in the family. If you can't do it for yourself do it for those that depend on you.
"I quit using Chantix,  The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr, and I went to the Website, whyquit.com to read, and watch their videos. 
I also got some 100% cranberry juice. Anytime I felt a craving I would take a swig of that. It helped with keeping my blood sugar stable. 
I've been nicotine free for 4 years.  "

So apparently if you have pretty bad liver injury your nicotine dependency goes in the toilet. For some reason people with liver disease can’t tolerate cigarettes. I learned this after developing alcohol poisoning and then finding cigarettes disgusting. 
"I don't even smoke, what am I doing here"
"First off, you have to want to. For me, after about a 20 year relationship with nicotine and approaching my 40th birthday, I was ready to break up with it. A few years back, when my kid was born, I switched to the vape. I was already down to about a cig or two a day at the time so it wasn’t hard. I discovered that I really liked vaping even more so than cigs. That became the next problem...you could do it just about anywhere and with a 30 min work commute, that’s a lot of vaping, and a new habit. Last Jan, my high school buddy and I were turning 40 ten days apart from each other and decided to sever the tie to nicotine together. I’m now 10 month nicotine free and never thought it could do it. 
So....my advice: 
1.) Start vaping. You’ll still get nicotine and will learn quickly how nasty the old habit was. Do this as long as you need until you’re ready. 
Slowly bring the nicotine levels down at your own pace. When I quit the vape, I was down to 3 milligrams.
2.) when you’re ready to stop spending so much money on vaping, switch to mini lozenges. But the 4 miligram and bite them in half when you pop one. Soon, you’ll be annoyed at how much those cost, too.
3.) replace lozenges with tic-tacs

"Smoked for 25 years.  My last cigarette was the day I got a good vape kit in the mail.  It worked great.  You just need to follow a few guidelines:
1.  Get a strong enough juice that you aren't buying cigarettes.  Once you buy the vape setup, do not buy cigarettes anymore.  The juice needs to be strong enough to sate your nicotine craving.  I started with 18mg/ml juice, some people might need to start with 24mg/ml.  Vape as much as it takes to sate your craving without having a cigarette.
2. Have a good vape kit, and a good backup kit (ideally they will be identical so you can share batteries/chargers/coils/wicks).  Buying everything you need at once (2 complete vape kits, juice, replacement coils) might cost you $150 or more, but it pays for itself in a month or less, because you're not buying cigarettes.
3. Have a plan.  Say you're going to start with 18mg/ml juice, you're going to cut your nicotine by a third every month.  So after a month on 18mg/ml, cut it to 12mg/ml juice.  Another month, 8mg/ml, and then maybe go to 3mg/ml and finally go to zero mg/ml.  At each transition, it's ok to vape more, and you'll eventually settle into it after a couple days.  For me, this part was actually really easy.
4. Once you get to zero mg/ml for a couple weeks, you are completely off nicotine.  Keep using the vape, but start occasionally leaving it in the car when you go out and see how it goes.  If you need it, it's there, but you won't.
As far as a starter vape kit, you can check out /r/electronic_cigarette for recommendations.  I have been out of the scene for a couple years, but my recommendation is get a simple kit with a built in battery that you charge just like a cell phone.  Something with a tank that you can easily refill and coils you can easily replace.  Good brand names that I remember are Innokin, SMOK, Aspire, eLeaf, although I am sure there are new brands on the scene.
Something like this would be perfect IMO: https://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-Coolfire-Mini-with-Zenith-D22-MTL-p/ink-cfm20.htm
Remember, you'll want TWO of these. The backup kit is super important.  Keep it charged and ready to fill all the time. When you change coils and wash your tank, fill the other one and use that one for a while. That way, if something happens to your main kit: battery dies, it gets stolen, you leave it at the bar, drop it and break the tank, whatever - you aren't forced to go buy a shitty Juul at the gas station or even worse, a pack of cigarettes.
If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.  I got into building my own coils and mixing my own juice, so I can probably answer it."
Gum did it for me. Not even nicotine gum just regular old orbit or eclipse. I am completely addicted to gum now but atleast it’s somewhat of a healthier alternative...
"Sunflower seeds. I think that mainly worked for me because I chose chew as an alternative and had to quit that, but just the motion of bringing something to your mouth and keeping it occupied works. Also, don't vape.  "
"You have to absolutely be ready to quit! Just do the calculation of financial benefits of quitting. A pack a day in Texas is about $8! Multiply that by 30! At least $240 a month!
 Then think about the health benefits of quitting. You breath easier. Your taste of food gets better! I noticed after I quit how good things taste now! Which in turn caused me to gain a little weight because your metabolism slows down after a change like that to your body! You know you're less susceptible to viruses and bacteria if you quit because your lungs, heart, asophagus, etc won't be trying to regenerate themselves from the damage of smoking. I don't even have to mention the long term health effects! 
Lastly, and not really most importantly, think about the social benefits. It seemed to me that it was beginning to be a pain in the ass to be a smoker. Most restaurants and bars don't allow it. Most people don't want smoke in their homes or cars. Most people don't want smoking around their kids or especially babies. Your days of stopping the car to smoke on long trips and standing in the rain to get a quick smoke in are over! 
My point is to REALLY be ready to quit! Because you're not trying to convince other people! You're trying to convince yourself! Don't try to lie to yourself! It's pointless and redundant. So when you know you're ready, JUST QUIT! COLD TURKEY! It's the only way! Don't vape or use patches and gum. Don't dip or chew or switch to cigars only! Those are just other habits youre trading cigarettes for! None of them are beneficial! None! JUST. QUIT. "
"By an ecigarette.
Problem solved"
"Don’t tell anyone!
That was literally the one thing I did different that worked. Just don’t tell anyone that you’re quitting. Wait for them to bring it up. Delay that gratification as long as you can."
"I used the nicotine patch - the Walmart brand. I wore it 24/7, only taking it off when I showered. It takes the urge away, but I had trouble with the after meal smoke. I smoked with the patch on, didn't get the buzz, so it was easier to eventually give them up. The patch deals with the addiction. The habit is a bit harder. I took up doing crossword puzzles to keep my hands busy. I also didn't follow the time frame for switching strengths. I was paranoid that I would relapse if I went to a weaker patch. I did it in my own time and have been smoke free for 2 yrs. This was my second attempt at quitting. "
"Smoke-free for almost 11 years. Chantix got me through the first month and made smoking positively disgusting. I had to bail after the month because my stomach didn't react to the pill well, but after that first month it wasn't too bad.
One mental exercise that got me through a lot of cravings was to mentally tally up how many days it had been since my last cigarette if I got hit with a particularly strong urge. It had the 2 pronged effect of temporarily distracting me for a minute or two while I counted days while laying out exactly what I was going to be losing if I cracked. Once that number got up over 50 or 60 days, failure wasn't an option anymore."
"According to my dad, it's moving somewhere with cold winters. He quit about three months into the Michigan winter after we moved from Florida. "
"Just stop.
If that doesn't get through to you then you're trying too hard."
"Get a deep cleaning at the dentist. 
I started smoking when I was 14. By the time I was in my late 20's a pack could last me from 3 days to a week (more if I wasn't drinking). And I was mostly using e-cigs, those little single black ones that lit up at the end.  I hadn't been to the dentist in over a decade and when I finally worked up the nerve to go (at 34), the cleaning this woman gave me had me gripping the arm rests like I was on a plane with engine trouble. I could see flecks of blood flying out of my mouth. Still, my mouth felt so good.
When she was done she asked ""Do you smoke?"" I said ""I think I just quit"" and I was joking but I didn't touch another cigarette again. I probably would have slowed to a stop eventually but that dentist visit did it for me in one go. 20 years of smoking, done. I just turned 38 last week, so it's been 4 years and I don't miss it at all and I can't stand the way smokers smell (and feel so much shame over knowing I reeked like that for so long). 
My husband quit because I told him I wouldn't marry him unless he did. He misses it a lot though (he smoked way more than I did).
Edit: I'd say try to stay away from your triggers in the beginning. I could go through a whole pack in one night if I was getting drunk, so I just drank a lot less and less often until I was sure I was done with it."
"I divided it into steps. First I tackled my addiction to the breaks that cigarettes provided me, then the oral fixation, then the actual nicotine addiction. 
I started by transitioning from cigarettes to vaping. This meant I could Vape inside which help me get over the feeling of having to go outside for a break to smoke a cigarette. at first I missed the brakes but I realized after a while how much time they took out of my life. 
After I was vaping for a couple months and have gotten over the withdrawal of cigarettes I transitioned to the patches. that way I still have nicotine in my system but I could get over the oral fixation. It only took me a couple weeks to stop chewing my fingers off and by the time I got to the lowest level patch I knew I could do it. The first two or three days without the patch was hard because I had no nicotine in my system but I had been gradually reducing the level of nicotine using the patches so my body and mind could handle it!"
"Quit cold turkey realizing the truth is that you won’t die from withdrawal (you’re actually getting healthier by quitting), you don’t need cigarettes to handle stressful situations, you won’t smell like an ashtray, and you’re saving tons of money. "
"It’s not serious advice, but my mom quit after getting knocked up. I was an accident, so my mom quit cold turkey when she found out she was pregnant. 
Don’t get knocked up, but she says it’s the best thing that happened to her bc she quit that and drinking cold turkey. 
"
"Be sure you actually really want to quit, that's the most important thing.  If you're half assing it then it will never work.
For the first 2 weeks stay away from any triggers you have, i quit drinking and going out for example since i mostly smoked when i drank.  I would get home, exercise, eat and go to bed earlier than usual.  Take yourself out of your routine for a bit.  Quitting is only really difficult for the first 2 weeks."
I didn’t smoke but my dad a few weeks ago flat out quit. I came home from school and he told me to go out and buy lobster tails to mark the event that he quitted smoking. His reason was witnessing his brother passing away due to lung cancer and seeing his brothers wife and kids suffer the lost. I guess he doesn’t want my mom and I to go through the same thing. It was a big decision on his part and I am really proud.
"What helped me quit is that I had switched from store-bought packs to roll-your-own with less ""tasty"" tobacco. Once I got sick of smoking, the harshness of the cigs was enough of a turnoff that it was relatively easy to taper off and finally go cold turkey.
I wasn't a heavy smoker to begin with, though; just 5 or 6 cigarettes per day. And I had a few setbacks when I gave into cravings and bought myself those flavored cigarillos."
"Cold Turkey and pure will. 
Survive the first two weeks and you'll be shocked at how much you don't want a cigarette.  
I quit 646 days ago and it's the best thing I ever did. Now, anytime I smell a smoke I'm disgusted. I don't necessarily mind it, but it's just not for me anymore."
"I managed to do it in 2 years with vaping.  
Buy one of the proper mods, that makes good cloud and add a lot of nicotine to it.  
Keep at it for as long as it takes for you to start hating cigarettes.  
For me it was 6 months when the smell of tobacco started to stink.  
Slowly reduce the nicotine in it as time goes on.  
The next big jump is going from little nicotine to no nicotine.  
After 6 months of vaping no nicotine I started to forget my vape and didn't care I did.  
Now I'm clean  
P.S: Try not to gain weight. :/"
Heavy discount on my life insurance.
"two things:
1) get a smartphone app that tracks your smoke free days. It was really helpful for me to see my progress. After a couple weeks smoke free, I didn't want to break that streak
2) just fucking do it. everyone that tells you how hard it is to quit smoking wants to sell you something. seriously. listen to the language used by companies selling the pill or the patch 
>oh it's soooo hard to quit smoking. try this magical remedy to increase your chances of quitting. ^^the ^^side ^^effects ^^are ^^brutal ^^but ^^don't ^^worry ^^about ^^that  "
Move to a location with horrible air quality - Feel the sharp pain in your chest that comes with every drag.  Take notice of the slightly blood-clotty crap that you're coughing from your lungs.  That's what finally made me quit after 10 years of smoking.  It wasn't intended but it definitely motivated me to never smoke again.
"Hey ex-smokers whadda ya think of this. 
I smoke around 65 king-sized smokes a day. My woman is due in April and we always agreed that I would quit before we had a kid. I love smoking it's literally my favorite activity. Ive been an over two packs a day guy since 2012. I want to quit before 2019 so I've been reducing my smokes by a smoke or two a day. Do you guys think this will work for me? I know I can't do it cold turkey. I tried in the summer and lasted less than a day. I've tailored my life to make my smoking addiction easy. I work out doors and do a lot of driving for work. Every thing people have told me so far has failed to phase me. It gets super cold here in winter, I just convinced my self that I don't mind. I spend $16 dollars every 25 ciggarettes, convinced myself that I would just spend the money poorly any way. I'm over weight and athsmatic and was that way before I started so the health effects don't bother me too much cause I was always out of breath quick. Some times I think smoking is part of my personality, part of what makes me,me. I like having a reason to go outside during almost any event. I wonder if smoking is why I'm a patient person. I wonder if I'd still love my job if I couldn't smoke. I wonder if I'd still be funny, or if I'd be so friendly if I didn't smoke.
Do you guys think I can quit if I go slowly or am I better off getting an RX? I tried vaping a couple years ago, that wasn't an improvement ( I Vaped like 40ml a day at 6mg) and ended up getting really sick( I don't know if it was from the vape or not but I can't handle it any more. I like the gum and use it when I fly or when I know I won't be able to smoke for a few hours. 
I'm terrified of chantix, I've heard of so many people having problems in real life because of their dreams and I don't want to not be me. 
Bottom line I guess is I have to quit. I don't know if any smoker ever wants to quit and I've given up on the idea that I'd ever want to quit. I don't think I'd ever be ready to say fuck smoking, or that I hate it. I've always liked the smell of burning tobacco, and I don't think that's going to go away. But I hope that by slowly reducing the amount I smoke I'll be able to cut it out maybe with the help of gum before the end of the year. Please let me know if any one here quit that way and if it worked.
"
"Not me, but I do have a good experience.
I had a customer who was trying to quit. He quit the night before. Woke up and he felt great. Went to work, went to do some calls. Suddenly he realized that out of habbit, he had pulled out a cig, lit it, and was smoking as he was talking.
It's not so much the physical addiction as it was the habbit and structure it provides."
Just don’t
"Cold turkey baby. The best way imo. Just decide your done and that's it. Yes you will get cravings but just say ""no I am done."" That's how I quit."
"Gum
Whenever I wanted to smoke I’d chew gum instead"
"Hopefully I don't get too buried in this.  Here are the main points that I felt help me when I quit.
* Try to remove the association of stress=smoke break.  If you can avoid this relation, then when you have a rough phone call, or get bad news, you're willpower will be at it's lowest, and you don't want to cave in right then.
* Don't buy them.  If you don't have any, you can't smoke any.  I also **hated** ""bumming"" / borrowing smokes from other people, so if I didn't have them, then I'm not going to have one.
* Find something else to do with your hands.  Fidget spinner or anything else that you can play with.  Right now, almost 20 years from when I quit, I still find I can fidget with stuff a lot (paper, pens, caps, etc).
* If you do cave, that's fine. The world hasn't ended.  Just get back up and try again as soon as you can.  If you do it smoke today, stop again tomorrow.  YOU CAN DO IT.
Warnings of some of the stuff that will shock you (good and bad).
* Smelling stuff.  Give it a few weeks.  You're going to start to smell a lot of stuff. Your sense of smell sucks right now, and when that comes back you'll notice a lot of things that you never could. Especially how much another smoker actually smells.  With any luck, this will gross you out.  :)
* I'd say within the first week of no smoking, you'll start to notice that you aren't coughing up lung butter daily.  
* You will have dreams of smoking.  These can often be disturbing, and I can still recall one from years ago that when I woke up, I checked the pockets to my jacket and was shocked that I didn't have a pack of smokes in there.  The dream was so vivid that I had been smoking again.
* Months and even years after.  You will get some pretty out of the blue cravings to smoke again. Resist it, they will slow down to become pretty rare.
* People recommend food/nuts to help with cravings, but this is also something that leads people to think that ""smoking = skinny"".  You can easily get yourself into a bad weight gain habit if you aren't careful.  Instead of sunflower seeds or nuts, do strawberries, apples, pears, or even sugarless gum.  This will keep your hands busy, and mouth chewing to help get you through the bad part.
I had quit for over a decade, and 2 years ago I started having a few cigars ""once in a while"".  Next thing I'm getting Colts for cigars instead of nice cubans, but I'm smoking one or two almost daily.  That quickly turned up to daily, and 3-4 times, and next thing you know a pack (8) of colts a day.  I get a ""chest cold"", and I can't get rid of a damn cough for 6 weeks, just to get another.  Finally realized I was being dumb, quit those nasty things, and no more issues."
E-cigarettes without nicotine.
"Remember that quitting smoking is a process, not an event. If you slip up, don't give up. Even if you slip up a year later don't beat yourself up. You're human and you're likely to struggle. You will get to a point where you can't even stand the smell of them.
You're making the right choice! And hey, it will be difficult but u got dis! ;)

Cold turkey was the only way I was finally able to fully stop. Don't try vapes of slowly stopping just stop all together. 
"I would pop a werther's hard candy anytime I had a craving. When ever my coworkers or friends would go out for a smoke, I would still go but not smoke and just enjoy my candy. I didn't change any other part of my life or routine during that first 6 months of quitting. 
I quit cold turkey in March 2016. This spring is 3 years! "
"Exercise and switching to vape. Been around 3 months so far. When I misplaced my vape and all of my coworkers smoke it’s gets really hard. I work in the restaurant industry, seriously the only time you get a break. It’s been a struggle, but I feel better. Just bummed about all of the money I spent over the past 8 years I smoked."
"Water, water is your friend."
"Okay so it took several tries, but I ended up using the nicotine patch, and then I'd chew Orbitz gum all day, and I'd chew on those little plastic straws you get if you buy cheap lollypops, they would keep my mouth occupied after meals, when I was sick of the gum. "
"I quit using two things.
1. 'The easy way to stop smoking' by Alan Carr. Decide before you start reading that your going to believe what he says. You can evaluate its truthfulness after you have quit for a long time. One drag of one cigarette kills all the work you have done to quit to that point.
2. Nicotine patches. I bought the most potent ones and then cut them in half rather than spending more buying weaker patches.
FWIW im 37 and smoked from 15 to 31."
"I used to smoke near a pack a day and the wife had a baby on the way. Between worrying about him and adding up how much I spent I figured I needed to quit. However, cold turkey isn't my style and I liked the idea of vaping. I had tried it before but never kept with it. However, when i became determined to swap I had to find the nicotine level I was used to. Started at 12mg of nic and have dialed it down to 6. But when I found that sweet spot at 12 I had no cravings for a cigarette. My brother and mother still smoke so I tried a cig about a week into vaping and put it out immediately. I no longer enjoyed the taste and had no desire to smoke. Now I gotta kick vaping but at least I'm bringing the nic down. Hope this helps. 
Edit: Smoke free for 2+ years, no cravings outside nostalgia. Now gotta reign the vape in.
TL:DR Find a reason to quit that you can't shake, vaping can help kick the habit but to start with no cravings find the right nicotine level that you are used to. Also add up how much you spend and ask yourself what you'd do with that money. These helped me. Your mileage may vary"
I started to feel like smoking was actually killing me so I switched to using snus.
It’s 15 days in 5 hours. For me it was my sexual performance 
"For me, it was the money factor. When I saw that I was spending around $300 per month on cigarettes, I realized that my money could be better served in a savings account. So, I quit cold turkey. That was in August of 2009 and I've never looked back."
"For me it wasn't too hard, just because I don't like the taste it leaves in my mouth. "
"Don't hang out wirh people who smoke. 
I started thinking of my cravings as pathetic weakness and started to almost enjoy the burning intensity of them. Almost.

"What worked for me, was weaning myself down from a pack of full flavors a day to 5 Parliament ultra-lights a day, over the course of a couple of months.  after about two weeks of ultra-lights  it was like ""why am I even doing this anymore?""  It was inconvenient, I wasn't getting anything out of it anymore, It became a chore, the ultra-lights were so weak it tasted like breathing in someone else's 2nd hand smoke, eventually I just stopped.
"
Don't allow friends or associates to smoke around you. Refuse to be around them if they're going to.
"think of smoking as a habit instead of an addiction.
be honest with yourself and write down *why* you smoke.
There should be a number of triggers that make you want to smoke. 
recognize these triggers and avoid as many as you can while preparing to replace smoking with something else to appease the trigger.
for me i smoked because i needed a reprieve from my monotonous cubicle job. So when the cube walls were getting to me i would step out for a smoke break as usual but just not smoke... i would just stare at a tree and enjoy being outside for a couple minute then go back to work. i did similar stuff for all my other smoking triggers and boom no more cigs.

"Find something to do for the first week of quitting, backpacking, new game, have a kid, anything that will occupy your time for the week. I personally wasn't quitting, only ""stopping"" to lower my nicotine craving. Ended up quitting, but the first week was the hardest, after that everything else was pretty easy. Also, don't hang out with smokers for the first month, too many people get offered one and they then rationalize, ""one won't hurt""."
Don't start it in the first place
Never give up.  Interpret that however you want.
Don't buy cigarettes
"Never try to quit smoking. 
Do or do not. There is no try. "
"If my roommate is anything to go by, just experience some considerable headtrauma."
"Don't really have any tips for cigarettes specifically, but I've quit much heavier stuff... 
My advice is this: Decide what you want to do, then just keep going until you get there. Be like a runaway freight train, don't let anything stop you! 
Being a bitch at work? Keep going. Your health is worth a lot more than your coworkers workday.
Constipated? Keep going. Pain is temporary, victory is forever.
No patience with your kids? Keep going. A month with a grumpy parent won't kill them, especially if it means adding 10 years to your life.
Make a routine that you follow each day, no matter what, and believe in it! I had so many days  where I just couldn't find a reason to get out of bed, and days where I couldn't find a reason not to kill myself. But I had my routine. Get up, go to work, make dinner, tuck my son in, write diary, go to bed. Day in, day out. I believed in that, if I just stuck to it eventually things would get better. And they sure did! Holy fuck what a difference it is between then and now! Was a long road well worth walking. 
If *I* could do that, every single one of you can quit smoking on the spot the moment you just really *decide* to. Don't put it off waiting for ""the right time"". You already have it in you, might as well do it now and minimize the damage! "
"I switched to an e cigarette for several months, then briefly to nicotine gum, then weaned myself off the gum."
"I hated smoking for years but couldnt quit, 1 day I took some shrooms and when I got home in the morning I was staring at the beautiful flower in my yard. I looked at my pack of smokes and tossed them out. A couple of months later I was in Vegas partying and was drunk and grabbed a cig from my mate, once I took a puff it grossed me out and I tossed it. Never smoked again after that. "
"Smoke the last cigarette of your pack before you go to bed. It's really hard to quit if you have smokes left over in the morning. I woke up, had none left, and decided I wasn't gonna buy anymore. This was after like 10 or more attempts at quitting mind you. Perseverance is really the key."
"GET A VAPE
I'm not kidding, I bought one of these and never looked back. I bought one that isn't lunchbox sized and got the lowest level of nicotine and it's great.
Pro-tip: Tabacco flavour is terrible"
"Remove places from your habitual smoking.
I bought a new car, no smoking in it. 
I moved. Only smoked outside from then on.
I weened off of smoking at work. 
At that point I was down to less than half a pack everyday. At one point I smoked 2 packs a day. After a while I just didn't have the same attachment as I used to and I was done.
In my anecdotal experience you have to want to not smoke. Nobody I know personally that quit under duress while still ""a smoker"" succeeded. Those of us that did were done being smokers."
"there are no tips,no shortuts,decide you are never going to smoke again,and donr smoke again,there are the only 2 steps"
"If youre asking this, youre already on your way. It was a combination of things that did it for me: being conscious of when im not enjoying smoking; noticing the effects on my skin, smell, lung capacity; and this sounds silly but realizing I was addicted. I would picture my ideal self, and that self was never smoking. Once you make the decision, you stick with it. It's that simple. I don't have any coping mechanisms for the period immediately after quitting, I just stayed busy to keep my mind occupied. You can do this! "
"CBD oil. Not kidding.
I started vaping 550mg strength CBD oil, and I stopped a nastly nicotine habit overnight. "
I'm 5 years without a cigarette. I did it cold turkey. My biggest tip is that you have to want to quit smoking. Not just you need or should quit but actually want too. Because like most life changes it takes a lot of determination and discipline. It's easier to change if you actually want too.
"A lot of good advice in this thread, some will work for you, some won't.
My advice: replace it with something. In my case: exercise. When I got to the point where I couldn't resist the urge anymore, I'd run for a bit (didn't take much to be exhausted at that time of my life :) ) or do some push-ups. As an outlet for the aggressive feelings of withdrawal.
It's a serious addiction you're fighting here. And make no mistake, it's a fight to the death and so far the addiction has been winning. Now you decide fight back to come out on top. It (the addiction) will do anything it can to beat you, even put thoughts in your head that make it ok to smoke. So you need something to fight back and for me that was it."
Just stop. Think ur brain as an enemy. Gain control over it. Everytime you smoke you loose control over YOURSELF. What is more important? you having control over your hands or some enemy controlling your body. Also think about body as a property. And you staying in it. Everytime you smoke you loose possession of your house. 
Not for everyone but weed worked for me.
It's that 4th day.  Make it through that and you're good. 
It’s all in your head. Find the off button. Worked for me😊😆
Tyrone slapped my cigarette
"1. Really, *really*, want to quit.
1. Have a strong personal reason to quit.
1. Cut back slowly before your target quit date.  
1. Do not cave and smoke, but, allow yourself nicotine through other means when you need to. The nicorette inhaler worked well for me. Personal preference. Slowly reduce your reliance on these things and your cravings will lessen.
1. Understand that you may need to attempt quitting multiple times.  It took me 3 serious efforts, where I lasted up to 1 year before going back.  
1. Train your brain and nose that smoking stinks and is gross and you don't want it anymore.  
1. Smoke a ton of weed or dabs as an offset :P lol"
It may take many tries. I'm going on two years after this month without a cigarette but it took me about 10 serious tries of a week to a few months then relapse to finally get it.
I just got so sick I had to stop. Have you tried Strep? or AIDS?
Switch brands a lot before your planned quit date. Smoke a brand that tastes bad to you.
"I used to be a 2 pack per day smoker. I knew I could not go cold turkey, so I took drastic steps to reduce then stop.
Every week I did halves, as in: 
- Week one, one pack/day
- Week two, 1/2 pack/day
- Week three, 1/4 pack/day 
- Week four, two smokes/day
- Week five, one a day
- Week six-seven, one or two the whole week
- By week eight, I was done. 
I was an exec chef at the time, and the thing that stuck me the most, aside from being able to breathe and no longer hacking up lung butter, was within a couple of weeks, food tasted soooo much better to me. 
Been almost ten years, and have not looked back since.
Now when I smell smoke, I almost gag. So gross smelling to me now. "
"Want it. 
I weaned off them over several months. The less I smoked the less I liked smoking. I hate the taste and smell now. 
I didn't have any help. I went from a pack, to half a pack, to just a few a day,  then thought, ""why am I still doing this "" and stopped one day"
"Identify your triggers and eliminate them at least until you are fully over smoking. For me, it was drinking alcoholic beverages. I cut back my drinking significantly at first and then completely eliminated until I kicked smoking. The last time I tried smoking while drinking after not being addicted to cigarettes (at least 5 years ago), it felt awful. Now, I can drink alcoholic beverages with zero interest in smoking. In fact, it's also caused me to drink less, because drinking doesn't feel as good now without the cigarettes. Now I'll drink alcoholic beverages only in moderation and only if they taste good. Sometimes coffee is a trigger for people. Stop drinking it or switch to another form of caffeine. Sometimes its friends. If it's a friend, you need to spend less time with those friends or ask those friends to not smoke around you and do things with each other that aren't conducive to smoking. Make smoking inconvenient for yourself by staying away from places that allow smoking. If you smoke in your house, make it a rule that you can't smoke indoors. For me, living in Minnesota really worked because it would be so damn cold out that you didn't want to deal with it. You need to make strict rules and follow them.
Also know that most people don't smoke and that they can smell smoke on you and in your house, even if you can't smell it. It smells worse than you think. You don't want people to think you're smelly. A lot of people will also think that you're stupid/trashy for smoking. Most people don't know that it's not because you're stupid/trashy, it's just easy to become addicted to and extremely hard to quit. You'll also start to look and sound worse (sullen, wrinkly, raspy) and people will know you're a smoker. If the stuff I mentioned above doesn't work, then maybe the public shame factor will.
Think of all of that money you're blowing on cigarettes. I remember feeling rich after I stopped smoking. Right now, you are wasting a ton of money on something that isn't even worth the cost and will cost you even more down the line.
Finally, you have to want to quit."
Keep reminding yourself you can't afford it anymore and it will kill you.
I got the e-cig (before everything was called vape this or that) and gradually reduced the nicotine content over the course of about a year and then just gave it up.
"It can only be cold turkey.  I took a smoking cessation class, and the accountability was key to getting me starting.
Expect to gain weight - it'll be OK.
I had to stop watching movies from the 30s-70's.   All the smoking got to me - I even had to stop watching AbFab for the same reason.
Long term - you will cheat.  You will go through times where you pick it up again for a few months then you quit again etc...  Eventually you learn to fear withdrawal more then crave the cigarettes.  That said, it took ten years for the cravings to go away completely.
I suggest you look at pictures of lungs that have been affected by smoking related diseases.  COPD, Emphysema, and of course cancer.   That is reality, and it is a natural progression from smoking.  Sure, there are those people who are 102 and smoked 5 packs a day unfiltered since they were 9, but they are the genetic freaks.  That is not the normal course.
Good luck and stay strong."

"The physical addiction will go away if you quit smoking for 2 weeks. The mental addiction stays for much longer, and you essentially have to forget why smoking is desirable. I'm at about 6 months without smoking and still sort of have the desire, but it's much weaker than when I was 1-2 months in. 
I'm trying to avoid casual smoking, so that I will hopefully get rid of all desire to smoke. I guess that's my advice, don't slip up and eventually you'll forget the desire after a year or two. I think I've reached the point where alcohol no longer increases the craving, and that's huge for me. "
"I had tried quitting twice but failed. Being in France did not help. And I really wanted to quit. 
In a last ditch attempt gave control to a friend to slap me if I smoked. And we’re honest to each other. I was to do the same to him if he drank more than two glasses of anything. The fear and embarrassment of getting slapped in public saved me. Quit cold turkey. I although got two chances of slapping him!
Not been long but it’s been four months and going strong!"
"Smoked for a little over 20 years. Tried many times to quit. Chantix worked once but after 8 months went over to best friends place for a party. Friend smoked and the drinking ended that 8 months. On one attempt to quit, I've gotten home and realized only then I had bought a pack at the gas station I always use on the way home.
Not everyone is able to do what I did and move out of the country but I believe it comes down to one thing. Habits. The addiction and withdrawal part only lasts few days. What messes you up is the habit it anything/person that reminds you of it. 
Lighter in the pocket, yup.
Ash tray at home.
Stop at same store on the way home, always get a pack right.
Friends not helping.
When I moved a got rid of everything before the flight and didn't tell anyone I smoked when I got here. Made it so easy. Five years now not so much as a twitch."
"This will probably get buried, but for me it was when my friend started realizing he needed to quit. We had started smoking at basically the same time, just for fun at first, but over time it got to the point where he was starting to get pretty substantial cravings whenever he went without a smoke. I was lucky that I hadn’t developed those cravings yet, but it was a wake up call that I needed to stop before I did. 
Even without the physiologic addiction though, quitting was still tough. I’m a pretty anxious person, and without meaning to I had let cigarettes become one of the main ways I dealt with stress. Smoking gave me an excuse to take a break and have some personal time at a point in my life when I didn’t feel comfortable asking for either of those things. Also, being able to do something with my hands was a great way to vent some of my pent up nervous energy. Ultimately, it was a combo of therapy and altoids smalls that helped me quit. I was able to replace at least some of what cigarettes gave me with the mints, and the therapy helped with some of the underlying issues that made smoking such a tempting stress reliever to begin with."
"My last cigarette was september 4th. At a pack a day, for $6 a pack, I've saved $228.
Monetary gain was a huge motivator for me."
"I smoked cigarettes for 2 years before I decided to try to quit. I succeeded even though I lived with my girlfriend who smoked half a pack a day. after quitting too quickly (cold turkey) and relapsing a handful of times, I decided to take it slower on the next try. I gradually switched from cigarettes to a vape pen over a couple of weeks. at first, i didn't change my smoking habits, just added the vape. I would still take time to go sit on the porch and vape because on previous quitting attempts, I had missed the ritual of taking 10 minutes to sit quietly outside. before long though, being able to vape and get my nicotine fix indoors got me more hooked on vaping than cigs after a few days (it was winter and I lived in a rental).  at first my nicotine consumption went up bc I was vaping all day, but I stuck with my plan. rather than focusing on what I couldn't have (""no more cigarettes today""), I focused on an alternate/replacement that I could have, that still gave me the buzz I was after, and was still enjoyable to use. once I got used to reaching for the vape instead of the cigarettes when I got a craving, it was super easy to gradually taper off of my nicotine addiction. every time I refilled the tank on the pen, I added a few drops of flavorless, nicotine-free vaping liquid, then a few more the next time. first 5 drops, then 10, and so on. after a couple of weeks there was hardly any nicotine in the tank, and also hardly any flavor.
the reduction of nicotine wasn't dependent on a change in behavior. I allowed myself to vape as much as I wanted and still gave myself quiet outside time. it didn't feel like I was suddenly missing something. I didn't have to change my habits much and I didn't get hit by intense cravings. vaping just got slowly, steadily less fun and gave me less of a buzz as I added more and more nicotine-free liquid. I guess the key for me was to quit gently and gradually.
TL;DR
kept smoking, added vaping, phased out smoking, gradually diluted vaping liquid containing nicotine with nicotine-free vaping liquid. haven't smoked in 3 years."

"I started drinking lots of seltzer. The bite of it feels sort of like the feeling you get in your throat from cigarettes. Shop-rite sells ginger seltzer and it’s perfect for this.
Everything you do is worthless unless you truly believe you can quit. You can do it!"
Decide that you really want to commit never to smoke again. That's the biggest one. Practice saying no to yourself when you have urges. It gets easier with practice. Realize and admit to yourself that there is no such thing as just this one cigarette. It will snowball.
"Think about how bad you  smell to others  when you smoke, and call cigarettes stinkies. Also start using a vape instead and ween yourself off if cold turkey doesn't work. Cigarettes have more than just nicotine that is addictive, often its harder to quit those than the nicotine itself. "
"I've tried:
* The patch
* Cold turkey
* The gum
* Cutting back
* Non-smoking girlfriends
Nothing seems to work. My mother, however, found a sure-fire method of quitting smoking: she developed an allergy to tobacco and got very sick every time she tried to smoke. I'm still waiting for that top happen."
"I switched it with Epok, a purely nicotine-snus with no tobacco. Yes I'm scandinavian."
"Pick a day to quit where you'll be busy and stressed. If you relapse and buy a pack, smoke one cigarette and then destroy the rest of the pack. "

"I only smoked for 3-4 years but I just started smoking more weed. Want a smoke? Smoke a bowl. Want a smoke after your bowl? Smoke another bowl. Want a smoke after that bowl? Go to smoke another bowl and realize you're too stoned to smoke another bowl, so you turn on a video game or something.
"
"Buy a new car, your monthly smoking habit pays off your monthly payment, back in 2001 I purchase a new SUV and my monthly was $600, I was spending ~ $300 per month on cigs, I've quit a couple of times but this made it stick."
"I switched to vaping. I was already at the point where I couldn't stand to smoke another cigarette but my brain wouldn't let me go without the nicotine. I switched to a vape pen with 18mg nic. It was a terrible experience but ultimately helped me quit. I would sit around playing skyrim for hours on end and vape to my hearts content. I didn't have to step outside and it didn't make me feel like I was sucking car exhaust and coughing until I puked every morning.
I went a little overboard because I would lose track of how much I was vaping and my brain loved all the nicotine.
I started feeling sick but I figured it was unrelated and kept on vaping like a madman. I got worse until eventually I couldn't get out of bed. I blacked out and woke up 3 days later. I gave myself nicotine poisoning and possibly almost died. After that I have never touched either cigarettes or vapes and I have absolutely no desire to.
My advice is to switch to a less harmful nicotine delivery system but do not go overboard. Switch to vaping with a LOW nicotine dosage or get gum or a patch and ween yourself off. You will feel so much better after you quit and the thought of smoking a cigarette now makes me feel sick."
"Not a smoker, but my buddy is. He says Chantix (I think that's what it's called) is working for him. He's one month in. "
"Convert to e-cigs then try if you still want to.
&#x200B;
Buy a vaporizer. Not a juul. And legit one. I use the revenger x by Vaporesso. But i've had alot of different ones. 
&#x200B;
I smoked for over 10 years. You won't like it at first. You will probably go back to smokes for like a month or two. But eventually you will notice three things, when you do switch. You will have a lot more money,cigarettes will get less and less appealing, and you won't smell.  
&#x200B;
Like now, I might have one when I'm drunk, but it just isn't satisfying anymore. And you can ween down the nicotine quite easily as it feels more or less the exact same if its 12 mg nicotine or 3 nicotine(if you ween). I use all melon naked juice because the taste is neutral
&#x200B;
You feel better. 
&#x200B;
I'm from Tennessee. All my friends are smokers. The only ones who have successful quit, have all done the vap route. Its the only one I see work. 
&#x200B;
Smoked for 10 years. 2 packs a day. Those cowboy killers. Marlboro 100s.  been vaping 3 years. I drunkenly bought a pack of cigs 4 months ago and I still have 12 cigs in the pack. "
"Take deep breaths like you are smoking a cigarette. Hold the clean air in and release as if it was a cigarette. Helped me relax immediately. Also if you fall back, let it go, and just get back on immediately. It’s tough but you can do it"
"THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'VE TOLD FOLKS TOO!!!!
I literally pretend (when nobody is lookinga round) to smoke a cigarette, even going as far as using my right hand (i'm left handed, but i smoked with my right), and taking a deep breath. This literally felt like 90% of the smoking!
also, don't hang out with your smoking friends, and finally, quit drinking also. Your gaurds will go down if you drink."
"Read Alan Carr. 
Listen to YouTube hypnotherapy stuff, it’s more guided meditation but helps.
Go cold turkey, no gum etc, I tried many times before cracking this.
Chew gum after meals and when you crave it.
Fall 6 rise 7. 
Aka don’t give up, your cravings go away after 6 months (mostly) and after a year almost completely.
Source : I quit 8 years ago after too many attempts. Best thing I did."
"Move somewhere cold, I wasnt even actively trying to quit when I did, but being somewhere that it was ~-45° with the wind chill and not being able to smoke inside you realize real quick that smoke ain't worth it"
"You fucked up starting smoking, you're gonna have that monkey on your back the rest of your life. Too bad, you can't do it anymore. You are going to want to. You can't. From this moment on, you can't smoke. If you had quit a year ago you would have been done for a year now, this time next year you are going to be happy you didn't let it go another year."
"Don't quit. Don't plan to quit. Because you already smoked your last cigarette last night. You'll never smoke another one. You're not going to quit, because you've already quit. Smoke free 6 months. "
"I went the e-cig path after 20 years of smoking.  I got a POS for my first one, but then finally got a decent setup for my 2nd one.  That was 5 years ago.  My last analogue cig was almost 2 years ago (I'd occasionally have one after a REALLY rough day).   
I still use my e-Cig, so I haven't 100% quit - but I'm healthier in general.  I can breath easier, I have a bit more energy, coughing spasms are gone.    
I found I had to make a mental change to make it take effect too.  I was in a crappy place in my life, and this was one of a few changes I made to try and better myself all around the same time.

"It sounds super captain obvious-y looking back, but in addition to a cessation aid (patch) I had to start *thinking* of myself as a non-smoker.  Smoking becomes such a part of your identity, something people associate with you, and changing that behavior entails changing your conception of who you are, and how you fill the moment-to-moment windows that would usually result in going out to have a smoke.
More than once I had an internal conversation where I'd be thinking ""Hmm, I could go for a cigarette right now"", before catching myself and thinking ""Wait, no I don't - I'm a non-smoker.""  The patch helped a lot too."
"I tapered off little by little. Went from a pack a day to half a pack a day, to 3-4 to none."
"I quit cold turkey in 2010 after smoking for 9 years. Went to a party one night and smoked too much. Woke up next morning with bad hangover and shot lungs. Didn't have a smoke that day. Woke up the next day and decided to not have a smoke that day either and see how long I can make it. Haven't had a cigarette since August 2010.
Just do it, yo. Take it one day at a time. Don't be thinking about the next day. When you feel like having a cigarette, just don't have one. That's my advice, lol. It's not that hard."
"Cut the caffeine until the cravings aren't tearing you apart anymore. Caffeine intensified the cravings and once I stopped that, it was......easier"
"Got a few here
Don't force yourself to just quit one day while still smoking frequently. You'll crave that last cigarette you didn't have and are more likely to cave. 
Just smoke less over time. It can be a month, 6 months, doesn't matter as long as you're smoking less. You can do this by being conscious of when and why you smoke, and get stricter with yourself over time. 
Eventually cigarettes will start tasting like shit,  because they do. You'll force yourself to smoke a couple per day because the thought of not having one is frightening. 
That's the point at which you can stop and you won't miss them at all. 
Not smoking while drinking is the hard part. Took me 2 years but doesn't matter because forever is longer.

Perfect thread. I plan to quit on Monday. 
"Gradually ween your way off of it.
Smoke 4 cigarettes for two days.
Then 3.
Then 2.
Then 1.
Also just image the disgusting picture of smoke resting inside of your lungs and after a little bit your brain will subconsciously associate this negative image with smoking and your desire will disappear.
Also you could do more cardio, nothing's a bigger motivator when you run a mile and start gasping for air. Immediate consequences."
"Not a smoker, but use a Juul, and do it less and less every day. Example 100 puffs, 98, 96, and so on. Eventually your habit will improve, cheaper than those Nicorette patches."
"
Checking in - smoker for 20 years. 
I tried gum, patch but always went back.
First time trying out chantix and it seems to be doing the working so far. 
30 days  smoke free today.  I take 1 mg  a day. 
"
"You gotta quit every habit. I quit for months and hadn’t had any but I went back to school and found out I hadn’t quit the after class habit yet! One step at a time. 
Deep breaths and lots of food."
"*Want* to quit. I mean really want to quit. The will power to not feel like shit was my driving force and the only way I got through it. 
**Fisherman's Friend-** It's a brand of throat lozenge that is outrageously menthol. Eating one after every meal and as soon as I got in the truck curbed my cravings pretty quick. Breaking up that cyclical behavior is the second key to really quitting. "
"Just fucking quit.
I know everyone's different, but I think I've read that the single most successful way to quit is to go cold turkey. That's what I did.
Also, you can try to think about how much you won't fucking reek anymore. Yes, you reek. And yes, it has annoyed people. "
"I haven't had a smoke in 3 years. I want to let it be known that the urge never goes away, it only decreases. I was miserable for a good several months in the first year. Now its just a ""oh that'd be nice right now"" thought and then saying nah. But you can't do it alone. I lived on a college campus being a student at the time, and every corner had students taking bogey break constantly. No addict can fight the urge unless you have inhuman will power. You need friends and or family to keep you accountable. Good luck."
"Wean yourself down to the essential cigs as much as possible. For me that was three a day, wake up, a stress cig sometime midday or after work if it was a good day and a before bed one. 
I heard someone, maybe on a podcast can’t remember, talking about how although everyone knows that smoking is bad for you in the abstract it’s difficult to really comprehend or convince ourselves of the damage we are doing to ourselves in the moment. It helped me to visualize how many cigs I smoked a day and how that translated into the packs I had smoked over my life.  I tried to envision the pile that made and that every or any single one of of those could be the one to give me cancer and kill me. I really tried to take that in and to consider my habit as actively trying to harm myself. 
Then I took it day by day. My then boyfriend hated me smoking so on his birthday I didn’t smoke. It was tough but I made it. Then I thought “you know I did it yesterday, let me just see if I can do it today” and on and on. Till I made it a week. I even thought maybe I’d reward myself if I made it to a week with one but then I made it to a week and thought fuck that let me see I can do another week. And another. 
I haven’t touched one since. Stressful situations make it hard - try five minutes of meditation or a brisk walk or really anything else first before giving in. Just try to make it a little longer and longer. Try not giving in. Also if you are like me and a social smoker you might have to lay off the booze for a while. The hootch makes it so much harder to keep your resolve. 
Good luck!! You can do it!"
"I smoked cigarettes for 9 years, & am coming up on 5 months being smoke free. I was smoking a cigarette with my friend one morning, took a few drags & realized that I just didn’t want to do it anymore. Started to realize how it was affecting me, as I would wake up with chest pains & my mouth feeling dry & disgusting. Decided to quit cold turkey, only reason I was able to do so was because I knew 100% that I wanted to quit. That aspect of addiction is probably the toughest thing to overcome. It’s much harder if you still desire to smoke, luckily enough for me I no longer felt that way. Went through nearly 2 weeks of withdrawal & dealt with nausea/vomiting, massive headaches/body aches, fatigue, & loss of appetite. It certainly sucked, but not once did I even crave a cigarette during that time. I feel so much better having quit, & cigarettes don’t even cross my mind anymore. Mental & physical health have definitely improved over the last half year as a result. "
Toothpick in your mouth.
"Vape.
You can start with something like the JUUL, but there are cheaper ways (refillable pods, non-pod systems, etc.) to wean yourself off.
You can satisfy your nicotine craving (and eventually dial it down to 0), without inhaling all the other crap that is in cigarettes."
Eat healthy snacks. Drinks lots of water.
"I managed to quit only after I figured out I only started to piss off my parents. I was a long time smoker, but when I had this realization I quit without cravings. I actually have no idea how long it’s been since. "
"I'm pretty sure this is extremely inadvisable, but I got really sick in the winter. When I dragged, it burned all the way down through my lungs. I can't really smoke without thinking about how painful it was. I've dabbled since then, but haven't smoked consistently for 4 years (and haven't touched a cigarette for about 2.5). "
Jail. That got me ro quit lol.
Try vaping with low nicotine content then to the fruity flavours and then quit all together. That’s what I did smoke free for 2 years. GL 
"I had a little mint everytime I wanted a smoke, worked like a charm"
"Juul worked for me. At first I got it as ""why not"" type of purchase but literally next day my desire for a cigarette went away. Haven't smoked in bout 6 months."
"Dont tell anyone youre doing it. Helped me greatly. I just denied the need to go out for a cigarette, told people i was too busy at work and stuff. Bring things to chew on in the car, develop a new habit to do in place of what you did previously. So if you used to wake up, get a cup of cofffee, then go outside for a cigarette first...change that to getting ready while you drink coffee or make a phone call."
You can do vaping if you still like nicotine and what to do a lot less harm to your body. Just make sure you only vape and not half vape/half smoke. 
"First off I chose a date to quit, it was around a month ahead of time,  this was because of some upcoming parties and wanted to enjoy myself. 
By then I had the mindset that I just would never smoke again. This was before vaping, so every time  I wanted a smoke I had a mint instead. When it got really bad I brought some herbal cigarettes from a health shop. They were disgusting but it helped.
When it got really, really, really bad I used nicorette gum, this stuff works by releasing nicotine every time you chew. Don't keep chewing otherwise it'll taste bad.
Then one day I hadn't smoked for a while and I passed somebody in a shop doorway and they had just finished a smoke. They absolutely stank. I could only smell it because I was free of nicotine. That's when I knew I would never smoke again.
Its tough but it is within anyone's grasp, if your thinking of it, do it you'll feel better afterwards and these days smokers are being treated like such arseholes it just isn't worth the bother."
"Just stop!  I quit years ago before Chantix and the other nicotine aids. I have impulse control and bad habits like anybody else - so I suffered cravings, but it just wasn't that bad.
I divide it into 3 phases: 
(1) The first few days when the nicotine withdrawal is the worst, and will make your nerves tingle and your temper short.  During this phase, just do stuff constantly.  Clean your garage, weed the yard, go on a hike...whatever.  Distract yourself. 
(2) The next few weeks.  The constant cravings subside, but you will have cravings at odd times during the day - with your morning coffee, after a meal, when you walk past somebody smoking and it smells so good.  Distract yourself with other thoughts, or do a brief mediation
(3) After a month - you're mostly home free - when you walk past somebody smoking now, it doesn't smell good - it seems disgusting.  Advice here - just don't EVER smoke again.  Don't bum a cigarette at a party, don't buy a pack just to have a few.  Just don't!"
"The patch. It helped so much. I still wanted a cigarette, but i wasnt going to kill anyone if i didnt smoke. Also, my boyfriend really wanted me to stop. Xoxo"
"Sugar free lollipops, Make sure sugar free or end up with 4 missing back teeth like i do lol."
"Toothpicks 
A box of 250 toothpicks is like $1.50 and will significantly help with the oral fixation and hand to mouth. I'm a little cheater and have a Juul, but the toothpicks help me use it less, and I almost never smoke anymore. "
"First I calculated the amount of money I was literally burning for no benefit except increasing my risk of cancer.
Then, I totally upped my hygiene game and reminded myself that the minute I smoked, it would all be undone. Brushed my teeth several times a day. Switched from coffee to tea.
After 24 hours, I convinced myself that the next 24 hours would be easy. Then after 48 hours, I told myself that I had already done 48 do another 48 wouldn't be bad. Etc...
After a month, I relaxed knowing that my body had already begun to heal the damage I had inflicted on it and didn't want to set myself back. Switched back to coffee. Before long, I rarely even thought about cigs."
"The best tip I can provide is before you even begin - pick a date that you're gonna stop smoking. When I quit there was 1 month left until the end of the football season, I knew I loved to have some beers and watch football which would lead me to smoke. 
So I picked the last day after the Superbowl to stop smoking. I was able to, during that month try to be conscious and reduce my smoking where I could. By the time the day came I had timed my last pack, I smoked the last one knowing it would be the last. That was 3 years ago.  "
"Be broke, so you cant afford to smoke"
"Have something to put in your mouth. 
Yes I know you have the urge to make dirty jokes out of that statement, but eating gum helped me a lot."
You can't smoke them if you don't buy them. You don't need to go into a fucking gas station these days so don't. Have some control over yourself and make good decisions.
"Get an overdose. 4 packs in a row did it for me. After some throwing up, never touched a cigarette again. That was 16 years ago. From up to 3 packs to 0 in an evening. 
PS: I guess you might also die trying. But hey, at least you're going down smoking."
"Never a smoker, but as a child of a former smoker, my mom's favorite tip to tell everyone was inhaling through those tiny coffee stirrer straws really helped when she just needed to mimic the action of smoking. She'll be 21 years smoke free next month!"
"I was a smoker from the age of 10 - 3 months ago ( I'm 28) (newports). I tried everything in the book, cold turkey, e cigs , patches. Nothing worked. I finally got one of those juul things and i haven't touched a cigarette in 3 months. Don't even crave it. 
A couple of issues come with that though. It's essentially a replacement and you end up smoking the juul a lot more because you can smoke it wherever. Doesn't leave a smell or anything. So now i'm trying to quit smoking these things. I just ordered the lower nicotine pods off the site so i'm going to try that way.
Switching to juul honestly helped me a lot. I feel better, don't smell like cigs and i'm saving money as well. Try it out"
"First of all, you have to go cold turkey. You can’t taper off or do nicotine substitutes. You’ll just be half-assing it that way and it makes it that much harder to be nicotine free for good.
It’s gonna be scary at first, because you are redefining your life without cigarettes.  The first two weeks are rough, I won’t lie.  You’re gonna feel like an incorrigible child, not getting their candy.  You’re going to be very aware of all of your triggers to smoke.  Once you get past those two weeks, half the battle is won because you got through the physical cravings.  The mental addiction lasts much longer. I’m four years quit and I still sometimes get a mental craving, but it always passes and I’m off to other things.
Be aware that your mind is going to play tricks on you.  Your body and mind are rebelling against you because it is being denied something it’s regularly gotten for a long time.  You’re brain is going to tell you, “C’mon.  Just one smoke isn’t going to matter.  No one has to know.  It will be our secret.”  Do not listen.  Those first weeks and months are slippery, so it’s really important to stick to your guns during this time.
Chewing gum is good for the cravings, but I think cinnamon gum is more effective.  It has some bite to it that helps take your mind off the need to smoke.
Have a support system.  Tell your people that your doing it.  Having people championing you helps keep up your will power.  Let them know the small victories you have each day fighting through the cravings.  The encouragement will really give you a kick in the pants to persevere.
Occupy yourself with something you like to distract you.  It gets you through the day.  Think about why you are quitting and keep it in the forefront of your mind.
Lastly, take it one day at a time.  Every day without giving in to the temptation is a HUGE win for you.  And every day will be easier than the day before.  The farther removed you are from cigarettes the prouder you’ll be.
And smokes aren’t cheap anymore, so think about how much cash you’re going to be saving.  That’s ultimately what got me through.
"
"This is a bit of a CBT technique, but re-frame in your mind what you're doing by quitting. When you quit, what makes it really tough is the massive anxiety you get when you don't get nicotine that you body is craving.  
Essentially, re-frame your thoughts from ""I'm going to tough this out"" to ""This is exposure therapy to help cope with anxiety. And, every anxiety spike I can endure is exercise to resist anxiety from here on out"".   
At least, this is what worked for me. It really helped me resist those urges to go ""fuck it, just one won't hurt this quitting process"". "
"Find a way to break the habits of those times you want to smoke. Like while driving, or relying on it for a break at work. I actually achieved that portion with using Quikmist spray for a while. It broke my habit of needing a cigarette once x happens. It then helped when I actually cut the nicotine out fully, since you have less ""reminders"""
"I smoked for almost 15 years. I tried 7 times before I actually made up my mind to quit for good. Biggest help was those disposable eCigs–I think the brand was Blue. Not sure if they're still around but plenty of vape options. Eventually I just said, ""WTF am I doing sucking on a battery?"" And I gave it up altogether."
"Get cancer, worked for me. Haven’t had a smoke in 10 years come December."
"I used e-cigs.
This is how I've done it without any force of will or negative side effects.
Don't use a vape pen. It doesn't have to be anything fancy so maybe an iJust2 will work (40 USD)
Start with a high nicotine content.
Smoke cigarettes normally, except 3-5 minutes before you smoke, use the vape then smoke.
The last part is really important since you will always have nicotine on your body when you smoke a cigarette. This will trick your brain into disassociating nicotine with cigarettes. After a couple of days when your brain wants nicotine it will not ask you for a cigarette, you will instead crave the e-cig.
4th step: gradually lower the nicotine content of your e- liquid.
5th step: When you get to 3 mg/ml level nicotine, buy a large e-liquid (120 ml) bottle and two 0 mg/ml bottles. Smoke the 3% one and fill it with the 0% one. Keep doing this and it will gradually go from 3% to 0% nicotine without you noticing. When the bottles run out buy another 0% one and keep smokingbjt four a couple of days.
6th step: Stop smoking whenever you want because you're not dependent on nicotine anymore.
7th step: Never ever in your life pick up a cigarette because it will slowly creep on you and make you addicted again.
8th step: if you do get addicted again rinse and repeat."
Mini stroke 4 yrs ago did it for me
"I've quit many times in the last 8~ years. I've tried Zyban, Chantix, patches, gum and going cold turkey. 7.5 weeks ago I decided to quit again using patches. I found an app called Smoke Free. Whenever I'd crave a cigarette I would open the app to see the progress I've made. It tells you how long its been since you last smoked, the money you've saved and health benefits. Highly recommend this app to anyone trying to quit!
Edit- I stopped the patch after 2 weeks."
"Gum, toothpicks, lift weights. "
My wife gave me a blowjob every day I went without smoking.  So...get yourself one of those...
"Not a smoker, but a dipper. Best tip for me was I started identifying as “not a dipper”, so whenever anyone would ask if I wanted a pinch (or cig) I’d just say “sorry I’m not a dipper (smoker)”. "
I was doing work in a hospital and realized that there weren't a lot of old people who were obese or old people outside smoking.  Just threw the pack I had away and stopped cold turkey.  Quitting after the pack is done will never happen.  You just have to want to quit and then quit.
Smoke what?
"The desire to quit.
This might not seem like something to think about, but I have known at least 3 other people who wanted to quit and are still smoking. I wanted to quit and after my dad passed away my mom told me, ""you know your dad wanted you to quit."" That was the final nail to make me go through with something that I needed to do for a while.
4 years later still no cigarettes and I am going to run tomorrow (10/13/2018) a half marathon with a goal of sub 2 hour time. I still believe I made the best decision to quit smoking and the desire to quit is something I tell anyone who asks how I quit. Without that, it's gonna be a whole lot harder to do."
"Collect your last few packs of butts in a jar.  Fill it half full of water after you have finally quit.
When you get a craving, open the jar and have a great big smell of that ashy, tarry bullshit.
It may help."
"Get away from people that do it or any place that has smokers.
&#x200B;"
Go cold turkey. 
"\#1 stop being around people that are having one(easy), or recently had one (not as easy).
\#2 stop talking about it.  The more you bring it up the more you'll want to do it.
\#3 for those that still are, try to hypnotize yourself. I don't mean wave the watch BS. Try this: Just imagine the next cigarette you're going to have taste really awful for some reason - carry this up until you have it. Imagine something horrible tasting - even just like it came out of the gutter or something as you puff. Don't finish it - throw it away in disgust. And convince yourself the next one you have will taste like that. If you get a craving, rinse and repeat.
&#x200B;"
"For me, I just had to get to the point where I was sick of spending money on something that makes me feel like hacking up a lung first thing in the morning.  I was able to finally quit cold turkey after a few failed attempts.  My roommates at the time (friends of mine) were really positive influences as well.  "
"There's no trick to it. Put them away and never touch them again. 
How you do that in your head is your business. Nobody can help with that. "
"Hey OP, something that helped me a lot : https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/
Basically it's a challenge with yourself to smoke the least possible for 30 days. I smoked for 10+ years and failed to stop numerous times before trying this method. Something that made me failed is that I had no tolerance to failure at all : if I smoked one cig I started all over again. With this method I kickstarted the habit of not smoking and I've been mostly smoke free for 9 years now. I can smoke from time to time now and not relapse but I almost never feel like it.  
  
Best of luck ! "
"Don’t quit today or tomorrow. Book a date in the future, maybe one that has some meaning (a family members birthday). In the meantime, don’t cut back, just carry on as normal knowing that the day you quit is finally ahead of you. You will start to realise how much you are looking forward to it and whether you really want to quit. If you don’t really want it, there’s not a lot of point trying. "
Nicotine lozenges did it for me. I'm now completely nicotine free.
"Smoked for ten(ish) years. Tried cutting down, tried creating other habits instead. All just made me think about it more. So I just decided to stop.
I know it sounds stupid and I wish I could do the same for my unhealthy eating habits! But I just decided I didn't smoke any more. Now I find it disgusting, I haven't smoked in over a year and whenever I imagine smoking I feel sick remembering that awful taste in my mouth.
"
"I used to smoke a pack a day, back when it was still okay to smoke in restaurants. Never vaped. I tried seriously to quit over 5 times before I finally made my mind up. I did my research, which said your odds of quitting increase to over 50% if you do these three things: get social support set up, use the patch, and use a prescription medication like Zyban (Wellbutrin) or Chantix. 
I talked to a  pharmacist, who told me there are behavioral and a mental sides to addiction. The pills reduced the mental struggle by reducing cravings and anxiety, and the patch removed the physical withdrawal. The withdrawal creates cravings.  He said that the cigarettes, or vaping, give you doses of nicotine, so there is a rush and a withdrawal with every cigarette. The key is to avoid those little withdrawals, by keeping a steady stream of nicotine entering your bloodstream via the patch. This gives your brain a chance to break the behavioral habit side of it before you break the physical dependence side of it.  He said to get the strongest patch and step down. I wore the strongest for a month or two, then stepped down to the medium for a couple months, then the weakest patch for the last two months. 
Two weeks in advance, I got on the prescription, and I started telling everyone I was going to quit on December 29. Be as public as you can. Ask everyone for their support. They’ll be thrilled to help you! 
On quit day, I started by not smoking first thing in the morning and wearing a nicotine patch. I brushed my teeth, chewed gum, and ate baby carrots in the car. I gave up sodas and coffee, too. Carried a water bottle everywhere and drank lots of water. I cleaned the house thoroughly and washed all of the smoke smell out of my clothes. Cleaned the car, too. Threw out all the ashtrays. Stopped taking break outside with smokers. I stopped sitting around, watching television, and instead rode my bike. I hung out with non-smoking friends.
Reward yourself ! Each week, I would take the money I would have spent on cigarettes, and used it to buy myself a treat. Each month I was smoke-free, I rewarded myself again. I experienced occasional cravings, but fewer and fewer as time went by. 
I stayed on Zyban for a year. I stayed on the patches for six months. 
If you really want to quit, stack the deck in your favor. Plan for winning. Make winning as easy as possible and make smoking the hardest, least convenient thing. Make it your first priority. Put as many obstacles between you and a cigarette as you can!"
My parents smoked for 30 years and about 3 years ago switched to just vaping and barely do that now 
"Wellbutrin did it for me. It's after a year or so that you have to be careful. That's when you go ""O I can have 1"" and then you snowball right back to a pack a day in a week. Happened to me after a Vegas trip D: "
I did a p90x routine with a friend and couldn't breathe at all.... I threw the pack in my bag and literally cold turkey quit. Every time I wanted to smoke I took as deep a breathe as I could and tried to appreciate just the aspect of being able to breathe more so than a nasty ass hit of a cig.
Cold turkey. 
"Cravings don't last long and they don't go on forever but it's so hard because they're really intense.  You just have to tell yourself that when they come.  ""This will be over soon, just ride it out"".  I found it really helped."
Reading Allan Carr's book twice (before intending to quit so I didn't actually follow the advice therein and quit at the end - far too daunting!) and then a year or two down the line when the sub-conscious mind had convinced the conscious mind that quitting now was the only option: using Champix (nicotine receptor inhibitor) as it's known in the UK. Thankfully I had no side affects from that and it worked a charm. I don't think I'd have managed cold turkey so I'm forever grateful to the smart boffins who developed the drug. 
"Have a reason to quit. 
Remind yourself of that every time you want to cave.
If you do cave, get over it, it’ll happen at some point. Don’t just think oh thats it I’ve failed now, get your head in the game and think about what lead you to caving and make sure you don’t do it for that reason again.
Been 4 years since I quit, I’ve had 4 cigarettes in that time for various reasons but hey every day is a day better without them. "
"I used lollipops. Not great for your teeth (long-term) but I would use one whenever there was a point in my ""ritual"" times to smoke. In the car on the way to work etc.  After a month or so I didn't need it.  Going on almost 9 years smoke free. Best of luck. "
I'm still getting there. I quit smoking the day I found out I was pregnant and when I lost the baby I started smoking ecigs. Actual cigarettes make me sick now. 
"spend 6 weeks in a hospital bed. I did it! That's the hardest ""easy"" way to quit smoking."
Just switch over to Vaping big fucking clouds like those millenials with fucking big ass holes pierced in their ears and go to burning man.
"Not traditional in the sense of cigarettes - but more-so in the sense of nargile/hookah for me. Used to smoke about 6 hours a day, around 60 grams of tobacco and realized I need to quit after about 8 years of use.
I went the route of cold-turkey, which I failed at miserably twice before it stuck. 
* Recommend removing all instances of your habit from the house, ashtrays, hookahs, lighters, etc - bin it, or give it away. 
* Habits were the toughest thing to break - my body was programmed to come home, eat dinner, and then light up a bowl to watch tv. - so try and build a new habit (whether its working out, video games, etc - force yourself to do it for a few weeks).
* No matter what you do, keep your mind solely focused on how absolutely awful you feel during withdrawals, and realize that is your body detoxifying. Don't give in - I swear once you get past it, youll realize you never want to go through it again (mine took about 3 weeks of headaches, awful sleep, etc)
* Lastly try and build a support unit, all my friends knew I was quitting, my wife knew - everyone would try and keep me away from it finally during my weaker points. 
Good luck, I am now happily at 8 months, and have never felt better :)"
"I did the math on how much it cost to smoke and even though I only smoked 2 packs a week, the extra money helped when I wasnt making ends meet"
"My wife quit cold turkey. She just woke up one day and said ""I don't swing too do that anymore."" and that was that."
"I read the easy way to quit smoking by Allen carr. I didn't quit until about a year after finishing the book. No withdraw or cravings. The book really helps you understand the addiction and why you smoke instead of trying to just address the symptoms of trying to quit.
I was a pack+ a day smoker for about 7 years. The first thing the book tells you is that you should keep smoking while reading it.
Highly recommend to anyone who is a smoker and doesn't want to die a smoker. "
"Like everyone else has said, you have to want to quit first.  My first few attempts at quitting always failed and I would be right back to smoking a pack a day in no time.  I'm honestly not sure what clicked but here are my tips:
* Do it because you really want to.  It's going to be hell so you need to be sure it's what you really want to do.
* Mints, gum, whatever floats your boat but mints helped me immensely.
* My smoking was tied to habits such as eating, driving, and work breaks.  I attempted to find other things to occupy my mind during these times, and also inhaled Altoids like there was no tomorrow.
* Understand that no matter how bad the cravings get, they will go away.  6 years after quitting, I don't even think about cigarettes anymore.  I often forget that I ever smoked in the first place, it's a great feeling.
* Keep track of your progress using an app.  I thought it was neat that the app I was using would track my progress and tell me all the benefits of being quit for X amount of days.  It's been 6 years so I don't know if the app is still good but I used QuitNow on Android.  It also keeps track of your stats of how many cigarettes you've not smoked and how much money you've saved.
* Smoking hurts people around you.  I have a friend who is just not ready to quit smoking and it breaks my heart.  I love the guy to death but he's already overweight, eats poorly, and smokes like a chimney.  I've tried everything I can to get him to quit but he just isn't ready (see first bullet point).  My fear is that if he doesn't curb the habit now while he's still got time to fix his health, it's going to be too late.
* Take some deep breaths.  I was extremely irritable in the weeks that followed quitting.  The smallest things would set me off.  Since cigarettes are what I always turned to when feeling stressed or irritated, I had to learn of new ways to cope.  Deep breathing techniques helped to curb a lot of the irritation and stress plaguing me during that time.
"
"For me, I weaned myself. I was smoking one an hour so the next day, I wouldn’t let myself smoke for an hour and 10 minutes. Next day, an hour and 20 minutes between cigs. Maybe also no smoking in the car. Little things that stretch the time out between cigs without completely depriving me. No exceptions. I did that for about a month and then got the patch. Gum, lollipops, jolly ranchers were helpful with the oral fixation part of it. 
Also, don’t think you can be a social smoker. You can’t. Taking a drag off of a friend’s cig once you’ve stopped is basically your first cig back on the path to being a smoker. 
I quit 15 years ago and it remains one of the hardest things I’ve done. "
"I switched to vaping to wean myself off of cigarettes, then after a year or so of vaping I quit that, too. To help, I bought a flavor that I HATED and it became smoke the shitty flavor or don't smoke at all. I picked the latter. The hardest thing was being around other people while they were smoking, just the smell was enough to make me crave it ravenously. Someone would offer me a cigarette and I would tell myself ""it's just one"" and next thing I knew I was back to my old habits.
It's been about a year since I quit smoking entirely and I have no problem being around other smokers at this point but I still avoid the temptation.
My advice would be to get rid of anything that would tempt you or remind you of the pleasure associated with smoking. I got rid of lighters, ashtrays, and accessories. I stopped going to the smoking area on breaks (even though that's where my friend hangout) and made it a rule that smoking in the car was forbidden! (that was easy after I got my new car because I didn't want it to smell bad and it didn't have an ashtray or built in lighter)
I also stopped drinking which helped a ton, too. Having a cigarette with a beer is one of my favorite things so I gave up alcohol and stopped going to bars all together in order to avoid testing my self control. (or lack thereof)"
Went electric. Some may consider that cheating but it made it super easy 
"Honestly? CBT. 
You don’t need a therapist, you can just google any CBT worksheet available."
I actually just quit three weeks ago. What I did was get an “Addiction Clock” which pretty much counts the time you’ve been “sober”. I used it as a motivational tool. So if I was craving hard I’d look at it to see how long I’d made it which would help me not cave. Also chewing gum is good. And most craving only last about thirty seconds so if you start craving just do something quick to take your mind off it. Also don’t drink to much in the first week or two cause you will mad crave that shit. And after the first week you will find that your cravings have gone down significantly 
"Cold turkey as others said. ""every cigarette you smoke makes you more addicted.""
One of the most important things was a change in how I categorized myself. I became and called myself a non-smoker. It's not that I'm quitting or I quit, it's that I don't smoke. I identify as someone who doesn't enjoy smoking.
Been 7 years haven't looked back."
Just stop I did it I smoked for 20 + years and just stopped 
"Be a parent to yourself. You told yourself to quit, now stop making excuses and do it. You are an adult, you made the decision to smoke as an adult, now act like one if you want to quit. Cravings are rough, but you didn't decide to eat ice cream for every meal, every day for the last how ever many years. Why not? You could have, and it would have been cheaper. You didn't because you didn't give into cravings. If you can stand up to those cravings, you certainly can stand up to these ones. With in two to three weeks, all physical cravings are gone, and it's just between you and your mind. If you can't control your mind to look after your own interests and goals, why bother trying to quit in the first place?"
"Ten years, smoke free for over three."
"Good luck, OP!"
"(on mobile so forgive typos) i quit at the same time that i got out of a toxic friendship. basically their drama would lead to me needing to go on suicide watch at 2 in the morning and other such stress, and that stress made it impossible for me to quit. cigarettes were calming and were somethimg i could seemingly control. when i finally stopped being their friend, i found myself with the perfect opportunity a d quit. 
that was in january and even tho some days i straight bloodhound the air for the sweet scent of nicotine, ive found that quitting was easier bc i wasnt just quitting one bad habit, i was quitting with a whole bad lifestyle.
so maybe thats the trick: quit the stuff that makes you need a smoke, then you just gotta fight your want for one.
oh it does help sometimes when i shout GOD I NEED A CIGARETTE and then immediately say NO I JUST WANT ONE I DONT NEED ONE. sometimes"
"Brush your teeth right after eating if you can, or at least chew mint gum--for me, the after-meal cigarettes were hardest to give up.  You'll want to smoke less if your mouth tastes/feels clean!  I chewed Trident spearmint and it helped."
" Vaping, and now I have a juul which probably isn’t the best idea but I haven’t smoked in awhile."
"keep quitting, no matter how many times you slip. Just keep quitting, eventually the slips get further and further apart until you are able to just quit for good."
"Nicotene gum helped me.  I started out chewing more than the recommended dose.  I was addicted to it, but I didn't care.  Eventually, I transitioned to regular gum, and eventually quit chewing that.  If you're trying to quit, don't stop trying.  Everything is better after you quit."
"Gum. 
if possible, do pushups or some kind of exercise daily.  Working out is awful when you've been smoking so I built a negative relationship with smoking and started getting fit at the same time.  
Cutting down or taking a break from drinking can be good too as that becomes a self feeding cycle, plus your discipline is lowered when you drink.  
When I was out and about I would keep a cigarette behind my ear and see how long I could keep it there before I would smoke. It helped satisfy one aspect of the addiction which was physically having a cigarette and helped to delay the actual smoking.  I eventually worked that into just needing to put a cigarette behind my ear and that was it. Eventually a hobo or someone would ask me for a cigarette and I'd just pass it along. "
"I tried cold turkey about 2 years ago I lasted about 2 weeks...I’ve been using a Smok Infinix over the past month to cut out cigarettes, and I’ve also lowered my Nicotine amount. Not only has it saved me a ton of money since the pods are refillable, I haven’t craved a cigarette since!! "
Just stop and be happy u no longer smoke.
Don't smoke at work. It's easy to get in the rhythm after that and stop thinking about it.
"Well I've managed to quit smoking after 7 years and what really helped me was constantly vaping. Not the greatest alternative, but after about a month of 3mg nicotine juice I switched to 0 and haven't smoked since. For me, part of it is that the vape juice is so sweet/good tasting and then when you hit a cig it tastes like ass. Unfortunately I had to vape all the damn time to beat the urge. Now I can go all day without it at all cause I'm not physically addicted. 
I will say the hardest part for me was the shitty justification I'd make in my head. ""oh, I've had a bad day I can just go grab a pack then give the rest to x friend that smokes. "" Never worked. Then I started bumming instead of buying and giving friends cash to make up for it. Same damn thing. Good luck!"
"Work up to your quit date by stop smoking in your trigger environments first - driving, coffee, booze, work. If you can break those habits for a month, you can quit smoking ""cold turkey"" all together.
&#x200B;
Nicotine is physically addictive but smoke is very mental. "
"You need to know that making the decision to quit  isn't something you do just once. You have to make that decision over and over again every time you crave for a smoke.
Also, get some kind of nicotine product, it really helps with the cravings."
There are apps that helped me. Knowing that you've saved a shit ton of money was nice. 
"Perseverance. Try to do things that keep you busy. Exercise. Don’t drink loads of alcohol or cut down on nights out and events that make you wanna do both. 
Read a lot, especially Allan Carr’s How To Stop Smoking. That book changed my mindset, and my perspective on the drug. 
Also don’t be afraid to fail. Remember at the end of the day you’re only human, and you will fail. But then one day you won’t need to think about quitting, you’ll have quit.
Took me three times, and two relationships to really give up the ghost. It’s been one year and three months without a single cigarette, and I’ve never felt more alive. "
"This is going to sound dumb, but seriously just do it cold turkey. Find a friend or family member that will stay with you the first few days try to take a few days off of work to deal with the withdrawals and wait it out.  
You'll feel like absolute shit the first three days, pretty bad for a week, and feel great after a month. "
"I went the Nicorette route.  Quitting cold turkey wasn't feasible.  Nicorette took care of the cravings until I got over the chemical addiction, then just weaned off of the lozenges until I didn't need them.  Worked pretty well.  Going on 16 years tobacco free and being around cigarette smoke doesn't bother me."
"If you want to go the medical route, Wellbutrin stopped my smoking habit. Granted, I took it for depression - but not wanting to smoke was a pleasant outcome."
"You have to really want to do it. I did not use any methods to help you with, unfortunately.. Half-way through a cigarette, I decided I was done. Gave the rest of my pack away. That was that. It has been almost 10 years."
"I did the 10 session program from ""hypnosisdownloads"" dot com and would highly recommend it to any English speaker who wants to quit.   
I didn't feel any significant urge to smoke until about a week after I finished listening to the program.  But by then it was too late.  I was not going to get suckered into wasting more money."
"Smoked for 17 years. Pack or more a day. Decided it was time. You have to be ready, because quitting sucks, but is sooooo worth it. 
I did the patch for 6 months total. I spent the extra money on getting the name brand Nicoderm, not the generic. I started at the highest dose, and went down about every 8-10 weeks til I felt ok being without completely. Haven't has so much as a puff since March 2014. Still like the smell, but don't miss it. "
"Quit as many times as you need to, but understand when you're serious about it you must commit to never having another puff on a cigarette ever again.  This is the only thing that will work.
Similarly, you will have to embrace the cold turkey mentality but not necessarily the method.  What do I mean by this?  You will have to come to a point where you will not assuage cravings with an NRT.  You will just have to grit your teeth through withdrawals and starve your body of nicotine until it gives up asking for it.
People who allow themselves to believe that NRTs are going to make quitting painless set themselves up for failure.  After your last patch/lozenge etc., you just have to grind it out; if you continue to substitute - even with substantially lower doses of nicotine - you are going to end up addicted to NRTs or relapse....or both.  Trust me.
So use NRTs as a way to make that final battle less violent and exacting.  Go through the physical purging (hacking up crap, having flu like symptoms) while on the NRTs...sure.  Get yourself to a point where your body is looking for 1-7 mg of nicotine daily as opposed to 21+...sure.  Just know that no matter how much you wean yourself off, that last stage where you say 'no more' will be difficult and there is no resolution but to bear with.
Good luck.

Its been 9 days. Vape pen helps.  Its not so much the tobacco i miss as much as the other stuff. A week of solid insomnia has been pure torture.
"Set rules for yourself and follow them.  Mine were no smoking in the house, no smoke breaks at work.  Went from a pack a day to a pack every 3 to 4 days.  Then I bought a vape so I could sit on the couch and smoke when it was too cold to go outside.  I just never bought another pack of smokes.  I never really tried to quit, it just happened on it's own."
Actually decide you are a non smoker. Until I thought of myself as ex smoker instead of a smoker trying to quit it never worked. That and even a stupid cheap vape pen just to give you the oral fix.
I used a vape with no nicotine for about 2 months. After the hardest part you just have to... not do it I guess. Realize that many habits trigger your desire to smoke. Pay attention and do something to distract yourself in the moment of a craving. You just need 10 minutes. And if that doesn’t work then remove yourself from the situation that triggers your desire if you can.

Prozac and Anti-Psychotic medication.

It was sunflower seeds and cinnamon flavored toothpicks for me.
Have a great story as to why you quit. Make it so that you enjoy telling your quitting story more than you like smoking
Pick a date in the near future and time out your smokes such that your quit day starts you out with an empty pack of smokes. 
"Not hanging out with smokers is a starter.  This includes not being at parties/bars late at night... where you KNOW there will be smokers around. 
Maybe not forever, but definitely in the first few months.
Reminding yourself constantly how much money you're saving is another really good tip."
"I just quit. Dont do the whole "" ill quit after this pack "" or "" ill quit tomorrow "". If you truly want to quit then throw the rest of the pack you have in water. It will be hell for 2 or so weeks but if you have the will power just keep saying no. If people offer you one say no. The more you do this the easier it will get. It will be hard at first but it gets easier day by day. Also set up milestones. If you can go 1 day you go 2. If you can go 2 day without you can do a week. This may not work for everyone but it worked for me. "
"Cold Turkey quit for me Feb 29, 2018.   Only tip I have is to be strong and get through each craving....it will suck....but anyone can do it.   Just hoping it sticks!!!"

"I tied the choice to another meaningful event. I moved countries, and stopped when I got to Canada. First two weeks were ""difficult"" to say the least."
I used my ego to my advantage. Told myself this fucking little cigarette isnt going to get the best of me. I also started playing racquetball with my friends and i couldnt keep up so it was just extra motivation to stop damaging my lungs. 
"I wouldn't recommend it because it's not necessarily healthy but this is how I approached it.
The thing about smoking is you're dealing with several different habits at once. The nicotine addiction, the sedentary lifestyle from being a smoker (usually), the smoke at key moments of the day like after a meal or waking up, the ritual of taking a drag, the oral fixation...it's all psychologically chiseled into your head and it's REALLY tough to beat them all at once.
So my plan was to tackle things one at a time. For me, the ritual of holding the smoke between my fingers and taking a drag were pretty strong, so I switched to snus.  This gave my lungs much needed rest.  Snus is also a little safer than cigarettes so pretty much a net gain overall. I got to the point where cigarettes kinda disgusted me from the smoke smell and lost all desire to smoke just dip. 
From there I switched to the patch. I intentionally stayed on the patch twice as long at each step to make sure I eased off the nicotine dependence. I made a point to eat whatever I wanted, I knew I was going to gain weight. I'd rather be 20 pounds heavier and smoke free than the same weight and go back to tobacco.
After the patches I had gained some weight, about 20 pounds. Then I dieted and about a year later back to my old weight and now I'm tobacco free.  Took a lot longer but I'm confident I'm done with tobacco. pot is legal in my state and I don't even really like smoking it, I stick to edibles when I do it.
so basically I guess what I did was traded smoking for progressively ""better"" habits until I was habit free."
You have to really want to quit. Can't quit for anyone else.
"Okay, this sounds like a ""duh"" answer, but hang with it a second and let its simple wisdom wash over you.
To quit smoking, you only have to do ONE thing. *Don't smoke.*
Do whatever else you have to do. Alert everyone around you you'll be an asshole. Stock up on gum and carrot sticks. Sequester yourself in a bunker. JUST DON'T SMOKE."
"smoked a pack a day for 10 years to the day July 22nd 2003 - July 22 2013. I literally decided to stop going to the convenience store and never really thought about it again. There was a small transition period where I stopped taking 10 minute breaks throughout the workday that took some getting used to. I wasn't upset, stressed, financially strapped or in failing health, I just stopped smoking and seems like it was no big deal to quit."
"Set a date, tell everyone you’re quitting.  As you approach the date, with every inhale, think about all the shit that’s going in, condition yourself to hate it.  When the date arrives, stop.  Make the decision that no matter what you’re not going to light up, carry some nicotine gum with you but have some ONLY when it’s that or light up."
"If you’re also depressed, welbutrin can kill two birds with one stone. It can kill the cravings if you’re wanting to quit. 
Also: not letting a cheat cigarette halt your progress. Like: you’ve gone two weeks without a cigarette but you go out with the boys for beers and you cave and have one. That doesn’t mean you’ve stopped quitting, it just means you had a cheater. That’s ok as long as you keep going with the quitting. "
Smoke the most disgusting cigarettes you can find. The acid reflux and garbage flavour helped me stop. Couldn't smoke at all without getting the most revolting flavour in my mouth. Australia adds flavouring agents to their cigs.
"My way was honestly a mental change.
It upset me to realize how dependent I was on them.
I knew I was a stronger person than that. I was in college when I started, and just like a lot of young people, began buying them to smoke socially.
Well, that turned into burning a few between classes, then anywhere I had to drive.
Before I knew it, anytime I was going outside, or leaving to go somewhere, cigarette. 
It finally hit me one day when something so minimal happened, and my immediate thought was ""Ugh, I need a cig"" thinking how aggravated I was. It honestly felt sad, like...the first time I'm facing any 'real' adversity in life, and I'm already having to find outlets and creating vices for myself.
It was right then and there I knew if I didn't stop, I never would.
I think I smoked a solid two years, and legit cold turkeyed it.
"
"Ecigs with strong liquids (like 16-24 mg). 
Use it like you normally use cigs. Keep the habit alive. 
Quitting ecigs after was a piss of cake in comparison. "
The best way to get over smoking is to get  hooked on cocaine or another drug.
"For me, I had to approach it as an alcoholic would approach quitting alcohol. I had to approach it that I will always be a smoker and can in no way ever be ""just one"". I was able to quit successfully a number of times for over a month each but I'd think I was ok and not be so vigilant and slip up and be right back to square one in an instant. In the end it was was over 2 years after my last cigarette before I felt like I was really a non-smoker though even now - 12 years later - I hold myself to the never ever ever again not one drag ever rule"
"if you want to quit smoking, you have to WANT to quit smoking. until that, it'll probably just be a waste of time. If you REALLY want to quit, then it should happen without any tricks.  I went cold turkey because I truly wanted to quit, and I never had a smoke again."
I stopped buying them.  
"Switched to vaping, then tapered down that as well.  Feel great, about 2 months no cigs now"
"Finding out I had scary high blood pressure, I switched to vaping the same day and haven't had a cigarette since. "
"Everytime you want to smoke, drink a cup of tea. No specific blend, though I like green tea with vanilla and roibos tea the most.  
Smoke free since 2016"
Meeh i feel like you'd always have tea 
"Just keep going.
And be aware of each minute you have behind you of 'non smoking' "
I went camping for three days to get past the initial withdrawal symptoms. Then I bought a harmonica that I would play everywhere I drove so I’d have something to do with my hands and mouth. 
You must want to give up. Chewing gum helps. Exercise or just anything to keep yourself busy. Good luck
"It just sucks, it seriously does. For me I become so aware of my face and there's a ringing in my ears for a week straight. I'm more nervous and less personable because I am constantly just thinking about one thing, that ruminating thought. Then, the thought never goes away. You just get better and better at handling your emotions and stress levels until it seems to fade away.
Also, never. Never ever ever never ever even for a second think that ""just one"" is going to be ok. It is an immediate spiral back into the problem. 
Also also, if you fail and fall back in just try again. You will always be a smoker that just hasn't had one in a while, so don't get all beat up and give up if you start again. Do whatever it takes to stop if you do.

Try reading The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. I smoked for 12 years but I've been free and clear for 6 years and that really helped me.
"Both my parents use to smoke.
My Dad smoked for seven years, and he trained himself to associate cigarettes with chest pain and shortness of breath rather than ""looking or feeling good.""
My Mum smoked for 15 years, and decided to quit because she needed the money long term. She ate a mini chocolate bar every time she had a craving instead of a cigarrete. She gained a bit of weight, but if you can quit smoking, you can shed a couple of pounds.
As for me, I swapped to a vape a couple of weeks ago and have around 4 cigarettes since then. It saves me money, and I don't stink all the time, but the truth is I don't want to quit yet, probably because I'm still dealing with the shit that lead me to start in the first place."
"Allan Carr, but read it thouroghly and not to fast.  And.. just do it."
"reposted from something i replied to a while back:
Angry ex smoker here, smoked for 20 years, quit for 10 so far.
Get angry at yourself. Put a nicotine patch on and step the nicotine down slowly. Use them for as long as you need to but don't smoke while you have a patch on. I would recommend that you take the patch off at night if you start to have the really vivid dreams they cause. If you are the type of smoker that lights up as soon as they wake up you might want to leave them on 24/7 for a while and just deal with the dreams. (they can get quite intense) I found that Patches worked way better than Chantix which will make you want to kill yourself (its really an anti-depressant, close to Wellbutrin). Don't take drugs that mess with your brain chemistry if you dont HAVE to. You can do this without it, REPLACE the nicotine with patches, and slowly step the dose down. Its science. Breaking an addiction starts with stepping down your doses so you're not going cold turkey and shocking your system. as far as your body knows, its getting what it wants, just not the deadly carcinogens and other nasty stuff that comes with cigarette smoke.
I don't know if its true, but convince yourself that you will die if you smoke with the patch on.
Now for the fun part: Start to notice the smell other smokers. They really stink. As you develop taste and smell again, cigarette smoke will smell FOUL. Convince yourself you never wanna smell like that. Know that you DID smell that way and its unacceptable. Be embarrassed that other people smelled you like that and it was offensive. Notice how stupid people look sucking on those stupid things, freezing their asses off in doorways and outdoor smoking areas. Notice how smokers' car interiors smell and how gross it is. Houses too. Know that YOUR house and car smell that way too. It takes a long time for it to go away too. I wound up selling my car because it reeked, and buying a new one with the money i saved on cigarettes. ($7x2 per day $14x30 days in a month, = $420. that's a NICE car payment!)
Get pissed at them when they crowd the doorways making you run the gauntlet of foul smelling air as you walk into whatever building you're going into.
Kissing a gorgeous person that smokes is like licking a very nice looking ashtray. Its still disgusting. Pity them as weak assholes who cant control the simplest things in their life. You're way stronger than them. good luck. dont smoke. Refuse to be a slave to it.
The KEY to your success is convincing yourself that you don't smoke any more. Whenever you get a crave, (and they WILL come, and sometimes its like getting hit with a bat, ride them out. I chewed gum to get the menthol blast i was looking for. My jaw got so strong i could bite through steel cable.) Tell yourself ""Wait, I dont smoke any more"". let it become your mantra.
At 3 months the cravings will be less and less, then out of NOWHERE you will get hit with them again. Don't let it beat you. At 6 months it happens again, be aware of your brain trying to fool you into justifying 'just one' to see if you're REALLY quit. DON'T SMOKE! Don't give into it. This is normal to be happening, and you should stay the course of not smoking.
Use all that you have learned in the past to get you thru the craves. Dont be a weakling. If you need a break that bad, don't go out and smoke, go to the bathroom instead and just sit in a stall and browse reddit on your phone for 10-15 mins. Whatever it takes. I was able to stand out there in the smoking section with my friends and just not smoke. I don't expect everyone to have that kind of willpower.
TL;Dr: Grow a pair, Put a patch on, get angry with yourself, pity other smokers, refuse to be that stinky person, save money.
edit: some words"
chewing gum and knowing for a fact that after a week the chemical dependency will be gone. then it's just keeping honest with yourself and not buying a pack
Never buy any. Never ask for some.
"Buy your final pack and leave it unopened. It becomes the physical thing you are saying no to and once the cravings ease, every time you see that unopened pack you feel proud."
"Having a relative die horribly of lung cancer inspired me to quit smoking cold turkey. About a week before she died, I stopped smoking, haven't touched a cigarette since. Smoked for about a decade and have been free of it for... Wow almost 5 years now!
My biggest advice is to be realistic with yourself. Really, is it worth sneaking in a cigarette when you're doing so well? What about all the multitude of reasons you already have for quitting?
Exercise your willpower, you're gonna make it through, just stay firm and divert yourself with other things. I'm not saying it wasn't hard cause DAMN it was. But I did it and I've got such low willpower that I always impulse buy the candy at the grocery store or the cookies or whatever. If I can do it, so can you!"
I kind of quit cold turkey and then got the urges later on. I just used sunflower seeds and ate food. Kind of an unhealthy habit but I guess it's better than smoking. 
"This is gonna sound weird but I used to drag air through my two fingers whenever I would drive. It was an oral fixation in the car and on the way to work. Stressful situations and whenever I ate, I would do the same. 
"
Stop trying to fit in
"I was obsessed with quitting smoking and it made it difficult because I could think of nothing else until I gave in and smoked a cigarette to clear my mind. The only thing that helped was to distract myself every time I would start to obsess about my cravings, like going for a walk or doing a quick chore around the house. It took a few times but finally quit. 
Also, sneaking around to hide your smoking from your spouse feels like crap so some motivation from that as well.  "
"Keep trying.  No matter what.  Every day you do not smoke is a victory.  Do not let slip ups get you down.  It took me years of trying after 17 years of smoking, but I have been quit about 8 or 9 years and it is wonderful."
"I got a prescription for Chantix but I wasn’t optimistic that it would work.  I was a two pack plus a day smoker.  Loved smoking. Loved it. Three days in to the week that you take the pill and continue to smoke, my mother died of lung cancer. She had also been a heavy smoker.  All of the anxiety and unhappiness I felt from not smoking was engulfed by my grief. I continued with the Chantix through it all, and haven’t smoked in over ten years.
I would not recommend this method."
"You have to drive/walk to a store to buy cigarettes. Stop doing that. We are creatures of habit, stop going to the counter and giving your money for a product that kills you. "
"Everyone works differently, but this is what worked for me (currently 2 and a half years quit).   
First, I switched to vaping. Took about two weeks to really get into it (it IS different, you just have to get used to it - but you're still getting your nicotine). Then I slowly decreased the amount of nicotine in my juice over a period of many months (becoming accustomed to each level before dropping again).  
I managed to get it from 24mg of nicotine, down to 0.5mg. Then I just quit cold turkey after that. And you know what- the next two weeks were STILL hard. But not *nearly* as difficult as going cold turkey from a half a pack a day habit of cigarettes, I can tell you that."
i went and got hypnotized. best 150 i ever spent. 
"Don’t even up just vaping or using patches or gum for there on, i took some pills which took away the effect of nicotine, later it turned out they were not really safe though so I think they was taken off the market. But i did stop and it was in 2010, smoked a joint 2 or 4 times since though maybe"
"Step 1: Truly want to quit because YOU want to quit.  
Step 2: Quit cold turkey.     
This works. "
Chantix. I smoked a pack and a half a day for 17 years and drank all the time. Chantix is a miracle drug. It made quitting easier than turning off a Sacramento Kings game. 
"Honestly cold Turkey, I quit that way bc I found out I was pregnant. It sucks at first and my motivation was growing a human. But after she was born at like a year old I started again bc I was around smokers. Was told I had precancerous cells growing, and needed surgery in a month to remove it. It was successful. But your health is seriously at risk smoking. Do it for you. To be able to breathe,taste, and smell better both with your nose and your clothing."
"What worked for me was a pill, a drug that my doctor prescribed that I took for about 6 weeks (should have been 12) that made me not wanna smoke. The first few weeks were the hardest with changing habits and all, but I survived.
The reason I'm not stating the name of the drug is because I found out later (and I hate the doctor for not telling me beforehand) that the drug has side-effects. One of its side effects is depression/suicidal thoughts.
Now, I don't suffer from depression, but for almost 6 months after stopping to take that drug I had stupid thoughts, mood swings and shit. All in all, that shit is scary and I would not recommend it to anyone. My doctor recommended it to me because she most definitely got a kickback from the company. My insurance didnt even wanna pay for it. Fucked up drug, but it did make me/cause me to quit as I don't know if would have been able to otherwise."
"Studies have shown aids are ineffective, it's just about having a good enough reason to quit.  If you want to quit because ""eh, its not great for you I guess"" that probably isn't going to cut it if you're addicted.  I smoked 10 years then fell in love with a women who hated it.  I quit coldturkey and it was much easier than my earlier attempts at quitting using aids/tricks/sunflower seeds/etc."
"It gets a lot of hate but I was a pack-a-day smoker before my vape. Now it's been almost a year since my last cigarette. There was definitely some overlap, but now I'm down to the lowest nicotine strength (besides 0) and feel a lot better. The whole 'it saves you money' only applies to the little cheap ones, not the big box mods, which, while much more annoying to others if you're not attentive when using it, are also much more satisfying."
"I used a vaporizer, then gradually cut back on the nicotine concentrations. I then one day just threw away the vaporizer(it being expensive) I said wasn't going to spend the money on another one. I was ornery and irritable for a week or so, but that all subsided and went away. I am thankful everyday that I quit."
Dont buy sigarets.
"Zyban was helpful. It won't do it for you, but seemed to cut down on cravings without any noticeable side effects. It made my final quit much more bearable. That was a while back, sounds like newer drugs are even more effective.
Still went through the usual routine and needed to want it - I was sick of smoking, getting nothing out of it but scratching that itch. I've now been quit longer than I ever smoked.
The other thing I realized was that I couldn't cheat. At all. I have not had a single cigarette and do not intend to, ever. I know that even after all this time I could buy a single pack and be right back where I was by the end of it.
The scariest part of the whole thing was the idea of *never smoking again* and the feeling that I was committing to a lifetime of battling cravings. I can tell you this is not the case. By the end of the first year I realized I had already gone sometimes days without thinking about smoking. In the 2-3 years after I sometimes went months without even considering it. And even when I did think about it, it was very vague, weak, easily dismissed. After 5 years I had really no cravings at all - occasionally I'll smell it and feel nostalgic but that's about it.
The only long term effect is the occasional anxiety dream - you know the one where you have a test but forgot to go to class all year? I have dreams where I'm smoking and then realize that I've forgotten that I quit. I think ""dammit, now I have to go through quitting all over again!"" Not that often, maybe once or twice a year. I also think that's general anxiety (i.e. having that one *instead* of the school dream)."

"Hi, I’m late, but I wanted to share my story. 
I read something on Reddit once, this guy said he would start by taking it one day at a time. Focus on not smoking today. Then when tomorrow comes, do the same thing. All this time, he doesn’t tell anyone... until two weeks have passed. By then, when he tells his family and friends, they’re so happy for him. This encourages him to continue to not pick up another cigarette. 
I tried it out. First day, I ran out of cigs, but I hide myself at home, binge watching the first season of Stranger Things. I ordered food to be delivered and I never left my couch. Didn’t matter, my goal was just not to smoke that day. The next day, I did the same thing. By the third day, my partner came home from being away, and I told him I had not smoked for 48 hours and he was proud of me. 
When I went out and friends offered me smokes, I would decline but join them (crazy, I know, but I wanted to breathe it in). 
Three weeks later, I flew back to my country and broke the news to everyone. That Redditor was right. Their encouragement made me not want to disappoint them. Also I’ve come this far! Three weeks! I can do another three. That’s what I focus on. Short time frames. 
Next thing you know, a year has passed — and you haven’t had a smoke! 
I’ve been smoke free for two years in August. Oh yeah, I quit a day after my birthday, so I remember that day very well. 
Good luck to you, I hope all goes well! I hope few years down the road, you’ll be sharing your story to another Redditor. 
Edit: I want to add that I would transfer money that I would spend on cigs into another account that I never touch. Watching it grow made me feel so proud that I was able to save at the same time. "
"Best results I had was to do it on a trip. Getting away from my usual places made it easier to not keep hitting my triggers to want to smoke.
The other time I quit was when I was in the hospital for a week. Just didn't ask for a nic patch and was done by the time I was out."
Snus.
"Avoid situations that trigger you. Like...if you smoke after eating a pizza, stop eating pizza for some time. I always wanted to smoke while sitting at my desk....so I moved my PC to my bed and used my TV as a desktop. It really helped. Eating tangerines every time I wanted a cigarete helped me a lot. I ate maybe 1kg in two days for weeks ;)
Also a time were you are not stressed is good."
"Smoke free 12 years this month.  Heart attack, triple bypass, induced coma for 1 &1/2 weeks.  Woke up and never wanted a cigarette again.  
Don't do it like me.  Quit before it's too late."
"Cut back little by little. Once you’re down to a few a day, cold turkey. "
I told everyone I was quitting. I am way too proud to accept public defeat !
Yall need to stop talking smack about cold turkeys. Thanksgiving is coming up. 
"PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE Read the book titled ""Easy way to quit smoking by: Allen Carr.
Lots of people have used this book to quit including Ellen Degenerous, and Ashton Kutcher.
It's a shame not more people know about this book cause it's the one thing that worked and stuck.
Smoke free for 4 months :)"
I quit cold turkey on a drive to visit family when I realized I'd pulled into a rest stop if driven past hundreds of times before just because I wanted a smoke. Realizing I'd altered my habits just for the sake of smoking turned out to be a big turn off to the whole idea. Getting away from the crowd of 'friends' who's originally encouraged me to start smoking helped as well.
