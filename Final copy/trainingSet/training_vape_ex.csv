2,poverty - in my early 20's I hit a rough patch and I had to choose smoking or eating.
2,I'm glad you made the right choice
2,I usually just smoked hand-rolled to fight off the ravenous hunger I created for myself.
2,I've definitely had the do I buy a pack of cigarettes or buy some food conundrum many time when I was smoking. It almost always ended with a pack of Newport 100s.

2,"""Ugh, I still remember a time a few years ago when I had hit a really rough time. I didn't get paid for 4 days, and I literally only had ramen noodles to eat, which I was so sick of that I would go days without eating rather than suffer through that crap."
2,"I ran out of cigs and tore my entire place apart. I went through every crevice looking for the slightest amount of change. After this I did the same in my car, then walked around the apartment looking for change. Took me 3 hours, but I managed to find $5 which I walked to the store with the buy some cigs. Sad that I just accepted not eating while going to such great lengthys to have a smoke. """
2,That's what finally did it for my husband. He had been smoking for about 7 years until one day when we had all of 32 cents in our checking account. He hasn't bought a pack since. I'm very proud of him.
2,In my early 20s I was picking butts and rolling refried cigarettes. It was pretty disgusting.
2,"""This is how I got myself to quit."
2,">Do I want to eat? Or do I want a smoke?"""
2,"""I never got that bad, but sitting down and realizing my cigarette bill and my rent were both taking up 25% of my income did the trick.  I was great at living on the cheap except for one line item..."""
2,"""Could of just ate the cigarettes ya know, win-win situation."""
2,Addicted to food.
2,"""I had to make a similar choice when I was around 19. Unfortunately I chose smoking over eating. I lost 60 lbs in 4 months. Still a smoker though. I made the wrong choice"

2,"""Choose between smoking or eating? You could never be a model."
2,"*eats bbq bacon cheeseburger*"""
2,I know many people who would choose the smokes... :/
2,"""This. The moment I had to choose between having lunch or buying a pack, that was when I stopped. Amazing how much money I wasted on that vice..."""
2,"""You didn't eat the cigarettes,  did you?"""
2,Started to eat the cigarettes. Brillant save Time and money
2,I choose smoking over eating all the time you're comment makes feel stupid.
2,"""Similar story, except I just got fired and couldn't afford cigarettes OR food.  I had read about the master cleanse fast and decided that was the time to try it."
2,"I had some nicotine patches left over from a previous quit attempt and wore them while fasting.  By day three, the nicotine was overwhelming me; I'd get dizzy and had to take the patch off.  Never smoked again.  Apparently the fast made me overly sensitive to the nicotine."
2,"Funny thing was, I wasn't trying to quit, just get by until my last check arrived, but that was the quit that worked permanently."""
2,So... what did you choose??
2,"""I work with the low income population, and I have seen so many people make teh other choice.  """"I have no money, please give me food.""""  However, they have a pack of cigarettes.  For some people it seems as """"necessary"""" as rent.  """"I make $700 a month. My rent is $400, cigarettes are $150 so I only have $150 left over for everything else."""" """
2,One time I had to choose between dinner or cigarettes and I chose cigarettes.
2,"""Dude, the exact same situation here."""
2,"""Bleh, I justified the appetite suppressant effect as being cheaper than smoking."
2,$7 to cut out two meals a day? Ok!
2,"Then I learned to make cheaper food."""
2,"""I was kinda broke too when I quit smoking, but after you factored in the increased need for groceries (since everything tastes AMAZING when you stop committing taste bud genocide), I don't think I came out much ahead."""
2,This is the exact reason why I'm quitting. Today is day 1
2,So you decided to eat the cigarettes?
2,"""Came here to say this."
2,"I only quit due to lack of money and little willpower. Never ever smoking again."""
2,I wish this would work for my sister's husband. I'm constantly sending money their way and ordering pizza for her and her kids because they're so low on money lately. But they never have a shortage of Marlboro reds and Energy Drinks....
2,"""In college, my girlfriend lived with a girl who was getting a monthly student grant, which she would proceed to (without fail) blow within the first two weeks of the month. It would then pass that she would have to make a choice between food and cigarettes. She would choose cigarettes."
2,"Was crazy.  """
2,"""I came here to say, money."
2,People are being taxed out. Not to mention some employers offer healthcare premium reductions.
2,"That shit adds up fast, especially when something in the budget has to go!"""
2,Same here.
2,? Why not just eat the tobacco then run to bring it to a burn
2,Lol im there now and im still choosing cigarettes :P
2,"""I was poor.  I had to decide between eating, smoking, or paying bills.  I chose smoking because it curbed my appetite and at the time was cheaper than eating."""

2,Solution: eat cigerettes
2,"""Yep, that's why I quit. Once I realized that I'd made the decision to eat rather than smoke (and I was smoking hand-rolled at the time anyways, couldn't even afford those) I just started working on a hatred for the things - I watched The Insider (great film, especially if you need a reason to hate Big Tobacco) and researched a bunch of facts on cigarettes online. """
2,You should have compromised and ate your cigarettes
2,"""Money is a big factor, but I quit cold turkey after smoking for 8 years. I've been without a cigarette for almost 2 years now and I can't stand the smell of cigarettes. Just find a vice, mine is working out, along with changing your habits. If you usually go outside for a smoke on your lunch then stay inside. Just stay away from temptations. """
2,Eat the cigarettes. Problem solved.
2,"""Poverty for me, too. The winter electric bill came and I had no way to pay for it, so I quit smoking. I used the patch for a little while to give myself time to get past the habit before I worked on the nicotine addiction. I also quit with a friend and relied on my spiritual beliefs, both of which were helpful."
2,"So, I guess it was the combination of peer support, spiritual internal coping, nicotine replacement, and being too broke to buy cigarettes. Quit 12 years this past November. """
2,I did the same thing with WoW :(
2,This is the only reason I have managed to give up for the last 3 weeks
2,So many time I chose smoking over eating...
2,I just gave up fruit.
2,Poverty is a treasure.
2,I've chosen to smoke in that situation.
2,"""This right here, I had the same issue its been a little over a month now but yeah to choose between gas and food or smokes and food had to make a call."""
2,This will never work for me... I roll my own and pay <$10 a carton.
2,"""Exact same thing happened to me, 21 here and i ran out of money. Only when you have no money does spending $6 every few days seem stupid."""
2,It's sad that I have chosen the smoking over food many times. It is terrible and silly in retrospect
2,"""I know choosing between cigs and food is a great way to lose weight, but this is a stop smoking thread.  """
2,"""So, you chose eating cigarettes? And you hit a rough nicotine patch?"""
2,"""Pussy, back in 'Nam I had to eat my cigarettes."""
2,"""So, which one did you choose?"""
2,"""Fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke. Simple as that... I got self conscious about my breath and teeth and the smell of my clothes. I wanted her to want to kiss me all the time."
2,"That, and she never pressured me to quit. She just said """"smoke or don't smoke, but quit acting like you want to stop and then buying more."""""
2,"Sometimes, I still have one when I'm really stressed. Finals week, etc. It's easy to stop there when you don't want to be a smoker anymore. I barely enjoy them now."""
2,"""Yeah man exactly how I did it."
2,"The girl's gone now, but so are the cigarettes. I'm happy with that result."""
2,"""I quit for a girl. Then a year later she broke my heart and my house got burglarized. Aaaaaaaaaand I started smoking again."
2,"I have been vaping for the last 9 months and I think I'm done with ciggys."""
2,Man I'm a shit girlfriend. I want my boyfriend to quit so bad and I bug him to stop quite a bit...I need to lay off and let him do it in his own time.
2,"""My girlfriend does smoke and I'm trying to quit. I haven't had one since yesterday, but I don't know how well this is gonna work out."""
2,"""My story, exactly!  (Except I'm a girl and he's a boy.)  He never pressured me into anything and I think that propelled me into wanting to quit.  My ex would force me to stop smoking and that just made me want to smoke more."""
2,Same with my dad. He quit once my mom was pregnant with me. It worked out well because I didn't know he was a heavy smoker till 12 years later.
2,Yeah I'm going thru that right now. She doesn't care if I smoke or not. But when I do it causes her to have coughing fits and I feel like a terrible person. I'm still struggling but I haven't bought a pack in weeks.
2,"""No judgement here - (I don't have a problem with people who smoke or anything), but I would say be a little careful with the """"very occasional smoke"""" attitude..."
2,"As someone who used to smoke and doesn't anymore let me just say that for years I would smoke very occasionally, maybe at a bar with friends, or at stressful times, etc."
2,"And a bit later, in a new city, I was regularly playing music with a bunch of people who smoked, and I'd occasionally bum a cigarette at practice. And feeling self conscious about always taking them from my friends, I started to buy packs again, though not regularly. But slowly it became more common, and I basically """"started smoking"""" again."
2,"I managed to catch it but I definitely found that the """"once in a while"""" thing was, for me, not actually a good idea. I've properly quit for many years now (and now have a child, which I think really cemented it for me, though I'd already stopped by then)."
2,"Even now I still occasionally feel the urge in certain circumstances, especially after a couple of beers, especially with people who smoke..."""
2,[deleted]
2,"""Yup, for me it was my boyfriend who is now my husband. I only smoked for about a year+ a couple of months. Started on my 18th birthday and met him at 19. Having someone you really like pull away from kissing you abruptly because of the intense smell/taste of cigarettes is a REALLY good motivator to stop. He never started smoking because his mom used to say """"It's so stupid, and it looks stupid. Think about it. You're rolling up a bunch of dead grass, putting it in your mouth, and lighting it on fire!"""" (Imagine saying that in a Bronx NY classic Italian mother's accent)."
2,"But, at least in my case, quitting was easy because a) I had support from someone I truly liked and respected, and b) I'll occasionally (by that I mean once every 4~6 months) will smoke hookah (or the celebratory cigar) recreationally. It's something you can share with smoker and non-smoker friends alike."""
2,"""I'm surprised you even would notice that. When I smoked I never knew my clothes would stink and my breath was bad."
2,"It wasn't until after I quite smoking and would be next to someone who did, that it dawned on me that I must have stunk that bad. The smell on clothes was very powerful too. But I guess because I was used to the smoke, I would never notice it on me. """
2,My girlfriend quit when we started dating. I love the hell out of her.
2,"""Funny, my dear girlfriend who I have been with for almost two years has been a smoker since we met, and that's how I started."""
2,"""Thanks for helping me to realize the inspiration I've needed!"
2,"I met a girl about a year ago, and it's been getting fairly serious over the past couple months. I know she would love for me to quite, but hasn't really pressured me about it."
2,"I'm flying half way across the country to see her in a couple weeks. I think I've just found a pretty great Valentines Day gift."""
2,It's amazing how quickly we begin to care about things when you find something or someone you want to be with.
2,Don't you find though that after not having one for a long time when you do it is the most awful tasting thing and you have a few puffs then put it out in disgust? I know I tried one after about a year of none and that is what I thought.
2,are you my clone...
2,"""Man, you did it for a girl? You're going to spark up the moment you break up."""
2,"""I have the opposite story. I am a girl and fell in love with my boyfriend, who doesn't smoke. He did not pressure me at all, but was very supportive when I was trying to cut down. He encouraged me, but didn't guilt trip me when I slipped. I didn't do cold turkey, I started with reducing to 10 cigs a day for a few days, then 7, then 5, then 3, then 1. I literally had a cigarette that I would only puff a couple of times from and then re-light it later. Slowly, i quit. I also got a new car and it really motivated me not to smoke while driving, which was probably the hardest challenge. """
2,"""When my fiance met me and we had gone on a 'date' or two, I straight up told him I wouldn't give him the time of day anymore unless he stopped.  He stopped.  """
2,"""I would like to commend you for that.  I recently dated a girl that smoked while drinking.  And every time she would drink then she'd get horny, and I couldn't stand to kiss her after and I asked her nicely many times to stop, and to not carry around cigs every where she went.  Neither happened and we broke up."""
2,"""Same. I fell in love with my boyfriend, and no one in his family smoked. Whenever I would go out for one, and come into his moms place, she would politely ask me if I could just stand outside for a few minutes so that I don't smell of it. I became self concious, and I could tell that he didn't enjoy kissing me after I had one."
2,"People always told me that you need to quit for yourself. I never could. He was the only thing that made me want to. 5.5 years later, I made the right choice. :) """
2,"""I have a friend who smoked and has a gf, she told him """"its me or the smokes"""" he """"quit"""" and she found out by some well placed info. They are still together and I believe he quit for good now. """
2,"""That happened on both ends of the spectrum for me. If I was with a girl that smoked, I smoked. If she didn't, I didn't. But most of them did so whatever lol"""
2,"""Mine was similar.  First date with my now husband I was walking up with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth.  He said, """"Oh, you smoke.""""  I put out the cigarette and said, """"Not any more.""""  I had one more about a year later that was disgusting, but I finished.  I then had about 1/2 of another a few years later and put it out.  Frankly, I loved smoking, and now I think they are positively disgusting."""
2,"""Good for you!"
2,"I wish my boyfriend was self-conscious about his breath and teeth.  Frankly, he doesn't care because he already has me.  I don't like kissing him. :("
2,"I told him to quit once and he snapped at me.  Haven't told him to quit again, but he knows I want him to.  He says he wants to, but who really knows. """
2,I want a girl :( should i start smoking then quit
2,"""Similar story. I fell head over heels for a girl, and noticed that she had taken to smoking when she was around me. I realized then that either I had to quit, or she would start. We're no longer together, and I've since found out that she has again started smoking. It breaks my heart to think she unknowingly changed my life for the better and I can't return the favor..."""
2,"""Same here, partner didn't care either way but hated my being wishy washy about it. I still have one once in a while -bummed one on my birthday, had a drag of a friend's at a holiday party- but I don't really like the smell or get anything from it now, and it makes me feel like shit the next day."
2,"I had to give up one of my favorite hobbies for a while though. I couldn't go to the bar and play pool without wanting to go have a cigarette between games with the rest of the pool playing folk. """
2,"""Similar story here. I met this girl last spring, long story short, I realized very quickly that I liked her a lot. She friend zoned me, but I couldn't help it, I still really liked her. I knew she hated smoking, so I never did it around her and always tried to cover up that I still smoked. I told myself that if anything ever did finally happen between us, I would just quit straight up."
2,"It finally happened just before Christmas. I love her very much and I haven't touched a cigarette since."""
2,My dad smoked a lot until he met my mom.  She didn't tell him to stop just that she didn't like the smell.  He's been cigarette free and married 25 years.  He still wakes up from time to time craving a smoke.
2,"""As a chubby, pasty nerd obsessed with Middle-earth.....I might as well just start dating cigarettes. At least they don't judge me."""
2,"""This is actually the reason why I won't start. I was about to pick it up, just to try it out and the sort. Met an amazing girl who absolutely hated smoking, made a promise to her that I wouldn't even try it. Working pretty well so far."""
2,"""My husband still smokes. He keeps saying he is going to quit, 3 years in. I am anosmic (no sense of smell- at all), but he knows because of that I am super paranoid about me and my stuff smelling like smoke.  He is down to three a day, and has an ecig, but just refuses to let go.  I never pressured or even asked him to stop the first couple years, because when we first met he said he would be quitting in a """"couple years"""". About a year ago I started asking him to stop. Not all the time, about once a month. We started rationing; he was doing 10-15 a day  (half of those straight after work shooting the shit with the guys; chefs) on his own, so we took it down to six at first, then every six weeks or so took one away. Got to 3 per day about five months ago and he refuses to go any lower, but I havent brought it up for a few months."
2,"It breaks my heart. I just wish he would stop already, but I know pressuring isnt thew ay to go about it."""
2,"""> I barely enjoy them now."
2,"That was the key for me.  One one of my last cigarettes, I sat there thinking """"I'm not really enjoying this anymore.""""  I finished that pack and quit cold turkey.  4 years later, I still get small cravings, especially if I've been drinking or if I'm around smokers, but other than that I haven't looked back."""
2,Be careful not to fall into old habits with those finals
2,I can really relate to the easy to stop when you dont want to be a smoker part. I've always enjoyed other things like hookah smoke because it tastes good and I just enjoy smoking so one day I picked up cigs and just really didn't like it. Kept it up for like 8 months and just stopped randomly. A few months later I started again for a while and stopped. Getting an ecig cut the few months on and off cycle because I can still play with the and have something that tastes good.
2,Okay... Just realized I am smoking while reading this thread. Than your comment was the only one to get to me... I want my gf to want to kiss me too. :(
2,"""> Fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke. Simple as that..."
2,"But if you'd stick with doing anal, she wouldn't smell you anyway, silly sir. Too bad you never thought about that. I'm sure your sorry now."""
2,"""So - for those weighing their options between falling in love or getting an ecig, where do you find a girl for $35 online?"""
2,"""My boyfriend told me that he used to smoke and I didn't want to be the reason why he began again, so I quit. It's been 6 months. I've struggled a lot, but he's worth it."
2,"However, if we ever break up, I have a feeling I'd probably buy a pack immediately. """
2,This is actually really cute and inspirational. I wish my partner would do the same :(
2,"""My boyfriend says he quit for me, but I didn't pressure him to. When I was 12, my mother died of lung cancer caused by a lifetime of smoking. It was hard for me to see my boyfriend smoke, but I never complained or told him he had to quit. After we'd been dating for about 6 months I finally got up the courage to say I was afraid of something happening to him. He said he had been waiting for me to say something about it. He threw out his cigarettes that night and hasn't smoked since. He said it was realizing he had someone in his life who he didn't want to hurt gave him the strength to quit. """
2,"""I started dating someone who didn't smoke and hated the taste, urging me to do the same. A year later I had successfully quit and she had started up :( I still don't know how or why that happened. Breaks my heart watching her spark up """
2,"""I quit for a girl also."
2,"I was trying to be healthy with what i ate and everything too, but really I just didn't want her to know that I hadn't quit after two years. Esp when trying to eat healthy and be a better person."
2,"I bought a pack when things got rough with her, both out of spite and to have a crutch, but they weren't the same and I knew I didn't want to start again. """
2,"""My mom got my dad to quit smoking by betting him that he couldn't. He finished the cigarette he was smoking and then quit cold turkey. My mom quit, too. Would be a pretty adorable story except they both started smoking again when they got divorced. """
2,"""I'm not in love, but same deal. I didn't want to smell or have awful breath around him because he was a pretty straight edge guy (with drinking being the exception). I never really felt addicted though, like I HAD to have one. It was when I was bored or needed to think."""
2,"""My bf is currently going through thid with me for the second time. The first, we had a pack-a-day smoker roommate and that made it impossible. I reassured him that if he was ready to quit it would be for him and I'd support him either way."
2,"He'll get there when he's ready, just like you were."""
2,"""Dude, don't have the one for """"stress"""".  It doesn't help you cope with stress.  Stop that."""
2,I wish that worked for my boyfriend. He's trying :( I never pressure him but it *really* bothers me in a lot of ways. I watched my grandfather die (and watched my grandmother watch him die) due to emphysema and it's something I never want to go through.
2,My husband quit because I told him when we met that I wouldn't date a smoker.
2,"""so that's kind of interesting. I fell in love with a girl who didn't smoke, but always begged me to quit. after 3 or so years with her I finally did (after many times explaining that her being so persistent didnt help matters) I quit. when we broke up, I immediately started chain smoking (probably mostly because she asked me not to and I was petty about it.) I finally quit for real when I actually got over her, which was around the time I realized I wanted to be awesome by my own account, not by anyone else's"""
2,"""Came here to say this. Problem is though, is that unlike some other people here, if we broke up I would probably go right back to it. Don't think that's going to happen though (no jinxies). """
2,"""That's sweet."
2,"The only time I've dated a chain smoker I got """"If you bug me about smoking, or try to get me to quit, I'll break up with you"""" very early on in the relationship :/"""
2,"""This exact reason is how I see myself quitting. Once I meet my girl I'm done. I've quit many times unsuccessfully before so I'm very confident I'll be able to do it. Until then.... I guess I'll just be another typical smoker, *shrugs*"""
2,"""I gotta buddy that's doing the same thing and I don't even think he knows it! We've been on him to quit for years but he just keeps on puffing. Now that he's not smoking near as much, we're all keeping quiet and hoping it sticks haha. """
2,"""I had a girl, that pressured me all the time and that just made me want to smoke more. Or even hide the fact I was smoking, that being said pressuring someone is not the way to go when you want someone to quit."""

2,Been hovering around 6-0mg nicotine for about 10 months now. I'm at the point where I can leave it alone all day and not really think about it.
2,"""This."
2,"Start off with a Blu e-cig that you can buy at 7-11 so you have no excuses like running out - you can get them whenever you have a craving. You'll quickly realize that they don't last very long and are very expensive, so immediately start looking into other options. Look online, or at your local tobacconist. Some people like no-hassle solutions like White Cloud or V2 e-cigs, where you just recharge the battery and replace the pre-filled cartridges when they run out. I don't. I would recommend a starter kit like an eGo or an eVod that lets you fill your own cartridges with a juice of your choice. I like the Vapor Zeus from Vapor4Life. When you're ready, you can then step up to mechanical mods, where you're recharging batteries, filling your own tanks, and rebuilding your own atomizers. The point is that it becomes less and less expensive, and you'll figure out how to get a quality vape that you really enjoy. The world of vaping and e-cigs can be very confusing - just keep doing your research and you'll learn it all in time."
2,The important thing is to just start down the path. Quit now. You'll be happy and proud that you did.
2,"Edit: Congrats, rottdog. And OP - the key is to keep trying until you find an e-cig that you like *better* than analogs. Good luck - you can do this."""
2,Just hit my one-year anniversary. =) Ecigs are the only things that worked after 15 years of smoking.
2,Electronic were my savior for quitting as well.  27 years of smoking and its been almost 3 years since my last cigarette.  A couple of months of electronic cigs(I had a nice ego setup) and I just burned out on it and never looked back.  Feels absolutely wonderful.  The first time I ran up my stairs and thought about the fact that I wasn't breathing heavily just brought the biggest smile to my face.
2,"""I never planned on quitting, I just wanted to try these things out. Ordered my first one from a website 3 years ago and about 6 months in finally said """"why am I still smoking analogues?""""."
2,"I like my nicotine though, sitting happy at 24mg/ml."""
2,Its been working so well for me. Haven't had a cigarette since new years day. I know it's not 3 years but it feels good

2,"""Agreed. Haven't had a cig in over a year."
2,"Some might say that you're not really quitting if you're using an electronic cigarette. Sure, from a semantics standpoint that's correct. From a health perspective, it couldn't be further from the truth."
2,"Also, I've weaned myself off nicotine over the past year and have myself controlled to the point where I don't really use my e-cig unless I'm drinking (in which case I vape like a mad-man). Cheating you say? I've seen far too many friends pick back up the habit during a get-together/binge...I'm simply being realistic with myself. """
2,"""These are just amazing. My sister, her husband, her mother-in-law, and my cousin all quit overnight using e-cigs. It was so effortless and they were all heavy smokers. Once they saw how well it worked for my sister, pretty much everyone in our immediate circle that smokes swapped over to the e-cig and they love it way more than they ever loved cigarettes. """
2,That's the route I'm slowly working towards
2,Got my first ecig I July and haven't had a cigarette since. Hopefully I'll also get down to zero nic eventually.

2,"I am a serial quitter. Smoke, quit, smoke, quit. I've quit cold turkey, used patches... When I started vaping, it was natural to break habits."
2,"I used cigarettes in conjunction with vaping at first, then when my pack as gone, I just stuck with vaping. As my taste buds returned and I got the sore throat and coughing, I started using it less and less - only as needed instead of socially. Those cravings faded, too. I carried it around with me unused for almost a year and only ditched it when I bought myself a new purse."""
2,I used the pen like vaporizer for six months. Starting at high nicotine level and stepping down every few weeks till I hit zero. From there a week latet it felt pointless.
2,"""In did the same thing.  I just dropped the nicotine content each time I ordered more juice.  After a month or two at 0 nicotine, I stopped vaping entirely.  It took about a year overall to kick smoking."""
2,I get shortness of breath after most hits on my vape. I was told I could be using too much nicotine.  I cut it down to 6 and still the same effect. I was also told some have a small reaction to the pg in the liquids so im going to order 100%vg and see if that helps. If not im going to have to try something new all together.
2,Same.  Am at 20mg nic now but I haven't picked up an actual cigarette since I got the unit.  The best part was just knowing how things actually smell and taste.
2,"""They are helping a lot in France, and there's a specialized store every corner (ok, like two or three in a small neighborhood). You reached no nicotine, it's great, congratulations!"""
2,I bought a good one but i havent found a single juice that is pleasant for more than the first puff. Horrible aftertaste or leaving my throat sore.
2,E-cig gets it done. But I wonder what health effects it has? Not sure if any study's or test have been done? With the FDA and so on.
2,I'm down to 16mg/ml. next bottle I'll probably go down to 10 or 12. Fun fact: nicotine contributes to atherosclerosis!
2,Where do you buy them without the nicotine? The only ones i've seen have the little cart in them.

2,5 months now for me @ 0mg.
2,Same here.  Only took me 3 weeks and then I was able to ditch it (the e cig) as well.  It ended up being way easier than I expected it to be.  My guess is that for me it was more a bad habit and less of a chemical addiction.  I smoked a pack a day for 15 years prior to quitting.
2,"""Same here but with weed, smoked it for 14 years and now I just use flavored ejuice without nicotine. It's not the same but it's better for my health"""
2,I quit chewing tobacco with e-cigs about 3 months ago. Started with the evod starter kit with high nicotine content. Just this week I got all the stuff to make my own liquid.

Many of us have even quit vaping completely, and only a couple have gone back to the coffin nails. I'm down to 6mg juice, and should be making the switch to nicotine-free juice in a couple weeks. I've been vaping since September 23, and am tobacco free since September 25."""
2,Is that completely healthy or are there still some slight adverse effects?
2,Are there any particular brands/makes of electronic cigarettes that stand out from the pack?
2,The electronic cig worked for me too! I started at the highest and then got ones with less and less nicotine. I wasn't even to the no nicotine when I literally forgot about smoking. Having a non smoker for support helps also.

2,My father quit when he saw me drag on a crayon...
2,"""I think my father quit for the same reason, although I was too young to know for sure."
2,I think what happened is one day when I was about 7-8 I decided to smoke like my dad did. He left them in the living room beside the astray. Only thing is I saw him walking up the street before I was done so I just put it out. He ended up seeing a half unsmoked cigarette put out in his astray.
2,"That's the last memory related to my father smoking that I have though. Since then I have probably had 5 cigarettes (I'm 28 now), just never had the desire but I can see how easy it is to begin."""
2,Exactly what happened to my grandfather. He saw my cousin who was seven at the time pick up one of his cigarettes and put it in his mouth. My grandfather snatched it up from him and took the pack and threw it away. Quit cold turkey just like that.
2,Similar for me. Wife was pregnant with our first child and the thought of something like that got me to quit. I would still cheat every once in a while when I went to the bars. Now that is not an issue for me since they banned smoking in bars.

2,"That's the *exact* same thing that happened to my brother. He threw them away that night and never smoked again."""
2,When the fear of loss becomes greater than the joy of smoking...you'll quit. All the stories on here will confirm. My wife quit. She wouldn't kiss me because I smoked. I quit the next day. I can't go my entire life without any lovin! Good luck to all those still struggling. It's been 7 years. I never even think about it.
2,Kids will do it. Mine was pregnancy. I quit and because of breastfeeding didn't pick it back up. Kids make u less selfish it seems.
2,"""i was afraid the top post here would be something along these lines."
2,it seems children (your own) are one of the few things worth while that make everything else seem trivially unimportant by comparison - they are important enough to give you the strength to quit a habit like smoking.
2,"second in line is probably a significant other that wishes you would stop smoking. and i doubt this is a strong enough incentive, either."
2,"so what would be a powerful enough driver for the rest of us who are single and have no kids? probably it's when your health simply demands it, and even then it would still be very hard to quit and probably too late already."""
2,"""I have a similar story, but from a child's perspective."
2,"When I was in elementary school, I was going through the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), and realized that what my mother had been doing could possibly kill her and it was hurting me too. So, my plan of action was to crush her cigarettes into mush and dump them in the trash every time I found her packs. Eventually, she gave up buying them and trying to hide them because she realized what I was doing was good for her, would save money, and she hasn't smoked since. It's been over twelve years."""
2,My parents didn't quit for me :( Now I feel bad.
2,"""In pharmacy school I used to run smoking cessation classes.  I had patients on NRT (nicotine replacement therapy), buproprion (Zyban), e-cigarettes (technically not a true quitting agent), and Chantix.  Some of my patients were ex-cocaine and heroin addicts which they claimed was easier to give up than smoking.  Out of this, the most success I had with getting people to quit was in pregnant women, or people with children going cold turkey.  The risk of harming your child is a powerful motivator."
2,"TL;DR: wanna quit smoking?  Start making babies """
2,"""Honestly, you're a great parent. My mom smokes to this day, despite me doing things like that throughout my childhood. I actually started smoking when I was 14, I would steal her cigarettes."
2,"Then when I was 21, my boyfriend found out he had cancer. He's cancer free now, so no worries! But the type of cancer he had was genetic. It happened at the chromosomal level, and he really didn't have a choice in the matter. By smoking,  I was making the choice to possibly put myself in the same position. I just couldn't justify doing that to him or myself, knowing the risks. """
2,"""Thank you. My father died of cancer when I was 23 (and my little brother was 16). It was heartbreaking. He was a heavy smoker and drinker up until I was born, but you've definitely cut down your chances of having your son lose his father. Word of advice - don't be paranoid, but be proactive about getting regular checkups, and getting things investigated quickly if you start having unusual symptoms."""

Well, she had the ashtray on the patio table and one of my littler cousins picked out a butt and went up to grandma smiling saying """"I can do it too!"""". Grandmother gasped threw her carton right in the trash along with all the ashtrays, said """"Grandma has been doing a bad thing"""" and never smoked again. """

He immediately got this overwhelming look of guilt over his face, then let out a sigh and begrudgingly slowed the car down, rolled his window down, and threw the beer as hard as he could across the road into the woods.

2,"When I finally quit, I felt so energized and happy. I felt like I got to quit, like it was a privilege. That weekend, I was holding cigarettes for my friends when they went in the house, shit like that, never taking a puff, everyone was amazed because I smoked SO much."
2,Hope this helps.
2,more details:
2,Made an account just for this.
2,Started smoking when I was 16. By 18 I was smoking about half a pack a day. By 19 about a pack a day.
2,"Sometimes I'd wake up and it felt like I was trapped in a nightmare I couldn't get out of. Smelled like shit, not attractive, more money than I should be spending, hate cigarette companies, no buzz except when first wake up and/ or drunk."
2,"Would impulsively try quitting. By impulsively, I mean would decide """"This friday, I'm going to quit."""" Or I'd destroy all my cigarettes at the end of the night and flush them down the toilet."
2,"This was a shitty cycle. Your mind plays tricks on you big time. I'd think """"Hmmm... live for the moment. What's the point of life if you don't enjoy it? You love smoking. Think about all those really good times you've had smoking."""" Then I'd smoke again and be super fucking miserable, which saps the will to quit, on and on."
2,"To those dicks that are like """"what, I thought you were quitting?"""" when someone fails to quit. Go fuck yourself. You pick up smoking and quit, then we'll talk. Anyone that's actually quit never do that shit. I understand it's hard watching a loved one kill themselves, and it's hard to know what to do, but just don't do that if possible please."
2,""""
2,"""As the only non smoker- my daughter's father and my mom and brother smoke, when my daughter picked up a pen and said """"look this is my cigarette"""" i went on a tirade. I found it so sad. I told her it was so bad, and that they were making bad decisions and that I never wanted to see her do that again. I hope she learned. """
2,When my son was born I swore them off too.  I didn't want to give up any of my time with him to such a fixable habit.  My parents also smoked and I  reminded myself about how embarrassing it was to go to school smelling like cigarettes every day.
2,"""I snorted Coca Cola from a straw when I was about 4 to show her I could do it too.  Short story: not the same as meth and my mom didn't stop."
2,"Coca Cola: not even once."""
2,My wife was pregnant; promised that this would never happen. I don't break promises.
2,"""When my 3 year old said the word 'cigarettes,' I switched to the vaporizer the next day.  In a few months I was using non-nicotine juice, then a few months later I was vape free.  I grew up around smokers.  Literally ever adult in my life as a child outside of school, besides my grandma, smoked.  Its basically the same for him on my side of the family and his father.  I was able to give it up while pregnant, when I found out even being around cigarettes would make me puke.  I didn't even think much about starting up again, but when my kid said that it hit me like a ton of bricks.  The best part is after vaping so long the smell bugs me.  Its the first time in my life outside of when I was pregnant that I even noticed the smell cigarettes have, because I'd been around it all my life.  I don't want that for my son."""
2,"""Even after that you still had to wait until the next day to quit.  Nicotine, man."""
2,"""I love how  you """"quit cold turkey the next day"""" and not the same day. """
2,"""Exactly this. There is no """"trick"""" to it, you just have to genuinely and completely WANT to stop. And it's tough, it's many small victories. My first was to resist every time I was in a store to buying a pack at the counter....they're RIGHT THERE. Just kept telling myself """"Nope. There's a reason you want to quit, remember that."""""""
2,I quit the day I found out I was pregnant. That was 3 years ago. Nothing like being responsible for the health and life of another being to make you put things into perspective.
2,"""That's almost exactly how it went for my dad. When my sister was born, he just quit cold turkey. No gum, no patches, not gradually, no nothing. He just didn't smoke anymore from one day to the next. """
2,"""My Dad quit when he was holding my brother as a baby, and accidentally burnt him."""
2,"""I had to Google what cold turkey meant (I'm Dutch). I quit smoking weed cold turkey, but I still smoke cigarettes. I will quit someday whenever I really feel like quitting, but for the moment I don't WANT to yet. """
2,"""My wife getting pregnant."
2,"I really just needed to truly WANT to quit.  If you go into quitting while expecting to put up a fight... you'll win the fight."""
2,"""Pretty much this, wanting to quit is the main thing. I've tried various things gum, e-cgis and the rest but the moment for me was it was either smoking or moving forward with my girlfriend.

2,"""For me it was also having a daughter. When she was with me, of course I wouldn't smoke. When I knew she'd be with me, I wouldn't smoke that day so I wouldn't smell like it."
2,"The hardest part was giving up smoking while I was driving. It was a habit I enjoyed most. But if I knew my daughter would be with me, i wouldn't smoke in my car two days before. Overtime, she was with me more and more, I smoked less and less until one day I noticed I wasn't doing it at all any more."
2,"I should add that I also wanted to quit. It made me self conscious at work. During meetings, during conversations with co-workers. Smelling like cigarette smoke sucks."""
2,"""I wish my husband did. Daughter is 2 mo old. I make a point every time he comes inside to he better wash his hands AND change his shirt. Sounds like being a bitch, but a newborn does not need to smell that!"""
2,"""Right on, brother. The first time my wife got pregnant we hesitated. We only slowed down the smoking. Then we lost the baby. Let me tell you that shit hurt. We cried for quite some time."
2,"The second time we got pregnant we walked outside and had our last cigarette. Now we have a perfect little one year old girl. I don't know if it was the smoking or nature taking it's course. One thing I can say is, fuck I'm happy right now."""
2,"""Same thing that did it for my dad. He smoked right up until around the time that my mom got pregnant with me, and then she told him that there was no way in hell he was going to smoke with me around, so he stopped. """
2,Do you live in Dallas by any chance?
2,"""Thats how my dad did it, it was in his head that life is about to get to a point where hes gonna let go of some habits. He cared , so he stopped instantly.  Never did smoke a thing,  except meat, for the past 26 years. Now hes 47, has a damm admirable charisma,  being hes a CDL driver (Class A & B , but mostly B vehicles) ."""
2,"""My wife getting pregnant did it for me too.  She was a smoker too, so I stopped to make it easier for her to stop.  It was the hardest but probably the best thing I've ever done."
2,"Also, I didn't want my kids to be raised in a house of smokers like I was."""
2,"""This is how I quit! Wife told me she was pregnant, So much was going through my mind that I figured, if my life is going to change, I might as well quit this shit and turn myself into someone my child can be proud of."""

2,"*get girl pregnant - you will stop smoking cigarettes*"""
2,"""yeah , let me tell this to my friend so he will quite smoking. """
2,I haven't smoked a cigarette in over a year. I was a pack a day smoker for around 15 years. I quit cold turkey using the book Alan Carr's easyway to stop smoking. Someone posted it to reddit late one night and I decided fuck it it can't hurt to read it. You are told to smoke at different points throughout the book and then have one last cigarette after you finish the whole book.  Well that last cigarette happened to coincide with the last in my pack and the next morning I just wasn't motivated to buy another pack and I haven't since.

2,"""Eight years ago, that was my story as well."""
2,"""My fiancee quit using this book after several years of failed attempts to quit. He only needed to read half the book before he stopped smoking, but finished it anyway. He is now one of the most obnoxious former smokers anyone could meet, and proud of it."""
2,"""Carr's book worked instantly for me too - 15yrs of heavy smoking.  Gave it to five or six of my friends.  They all quit, too."""
2,"""Pretty much exactly the same thing happened to me, about 2 years ago. I got it on amazon because I thought, why not? Previously I had quit for about a week cold turkey, but after a stressful night at work I picked it up again."
2,"The big difference I can see is that many people that quit using other methods are still sneaking cigarettes at times, especially when drinking. I remain repulsed by the very thought of smoking, and will (hopefully) remain so."""
2,"""Same for me, except I had around 6 smokes left in my pack when I finished the book. Breaking them up and pouring water over them was an amazingly freeing experience."""
2,Anybody have the link for it? Id love to read it myself.

I mean I felt good about everything I was reading, but this irrational fear that there's no way this is enough to get me to quit gripped. And there's the talk about the ritual at the end. The logic here is silly, I can recognize that, but at the same time I get this fear that this thing isn't _substantial_ enough to do what it advertises."

2,"""20 years smoking maybe 2 packs a day. 2 weeks 100% smoke free tomorrow. I had tried electronics several times over the years. You basically need to find a good mod and a juice you really like.

2,"People need to do themselves a favor and spend $30 on a Kanger Evod kit and get a couple different juices. Keep getting different juice until you find one you love. And every time you want to smoke, go outside and puff on that. Eventually you'll want to puff on the ecig, not a real cigarette. Then start puffing it inside. Once you actually enjoy it, you may want to upgrade to a better mod/kit, which I have done. I still haven't spent a ton of money, but I know its less than I would have spent on cigarettes. Now I can just get juice every couple weeks for a huge different in money."
2,I absolutely love a couple juices and I crave those now. I'm planning on tapering the nicotine down and eventually quitting juice altogether.

2,"""My wife and I quit in September after ~20 years in. Ecigs FTW!"
2,"It's expensive up front, and that hurt. But we figured out that with our starter kits we just paid what we would have spent on cigarettes for the month. Of course subsequent months are much, much cheaper. I use a little over 10ml of 18mg juice a week. That feels pricey at $9 a bottle, but since that's replacing $45-50 a carton for the same length of time it's a big win."
2,"Advice for those wanting to try it, start with the higher nicotine juices. We started at 24mg. I'm at 18mg now and looking to lower again soon. We tried once before this with weak gear and weaker juice (12mg) and it just didn't work. Suck it up and drop the money on a big cigar sized ecig. I know it seems like the little ones would be more familiar but trust me, they just aren't up to the task. You also end up spending more on refills."
2,"After a few weeks you will notice your habits shifting. Since you can smoke in places you couldn't before you will find different triggers, but you will lose some old ones."
2,"You will need to find a flavor you can live with. Personally I loathe the flavor of ALL the tobacco flavored ones. They all just taste nasty. I went menthol. I never smoked menthols, but the menthol flavors gave me a sense that I was doing something, but didn't taste bad (""""Smoothathol"""" is my favorite). Find a ecig store and try as many as you need to to find the one that works for you. It may be very different from your cigarette brand. It's simply a different experience than smoking."
2,"Honestly even if you never stop vaping this is better for you that smoking, and OMG so much better to live with. No standing in the cold/heat smoking, no rain in through the window in the car, you can smell things, the list goes on."
2,"**TL;DR: Vaping is great. Suck it up and buy the big kit. Use strong juice at first. Find a flavor you like.**"""

You'll find yourself thinking things like 'I've been smoke free for a week, I can reward myself with just one cigarette'. In my opinion, not listening to my own mind was the hardest part of quitting.

2,"But the important thing is to keep trying different methods until successful."""
2,Started at 16 pack every 2 days for 9 years. Moved to Minnesota . winter came. Fuck the cold
2,"""I had a similar experience: one day, after a desperate run to the nearby gas station to buy cigarettes, back at home, I suddenly realized how ridiculous this has gotten and just stopped smoking right there and then, ignoring the freshly bought pack and never buying more."
2,"The week after that was pretty rough, with intense tension headaches and anxiety, but then it all stopped. It just took determination and self-awareness - I doubt any other way would be effective for me. """
2,"""True for me. Started smoking in my teens, decided I needed to quit at 24. You really need the motivation, the rest will follow. One practical tip that helped me a lot: know that the (seemingly incontrollable) urge to just throw in the towel and smoke, disappears within 5 minutes or so. Let the urge pass, and reward yourself after - not with a cigeratte preferrably."
2,"The feeling of selfcontrol is infinately more pleasurable than the few minutes of sucking on a cigarette."""
2,"""Yep. I was too hungover one day to walk to the shop to buy smokes. Ended up going the day without one. Slept in the next day, went to work, didn't get a chance to get out to buy any, went home, was still hungover. Woke up the next day, realised I'd gone 2 days without a cigarette and thought it'd be dumb to go back. That was 3 years ago. Haven't had one since and that was after 20 years smoking."""
2,This. Firstly you have to really want to quit though. Once you get past the third day it's all mental.
2,"""I quit cold turkey also--definitely thin it's the best way. I also use a nicotine-free e-cigarette to avoid relapsing. I picked it up a few months after quitting when I wanted to go back."
2,"I really enjoy being able to puff on something when my friends have a smoke at a bar, etc. e-cig satisfies my habit craving, and tastes better than cigarettes ever did."
2,"I've had people say that's a backslide, but my lungs and I disagree."""
2,"""1 month into quitting cold turkey and I can get drunk with friends smoking all around me and not get the urge to have one. Sport helped for me, I started bouldering 6 months ago and noticed that my cardio was holding me back, that's what gave me the motivation to stop I think."""
2,I've just stopped.
2,"""I smoked for seven years, and the only method that worked for me was cold turkey. I tried the gum, patches, hypnosis; the lot. I smoke a cigar on my birthday each year, but other than that I haven't smoked since 2005."""
2,"""I """"quit"""" cold turkey. I didn't smoke for 2 months and by then, the addiction was gone. Even now, I occasionally smoke one or two when out drinking with buddies but I know I'll never go back and buy another pack for myself."

2,"""Cold Turkey it is.  I just stopped buying them.  That was it.  It was hard, and I slipped a little by borrowing from friends once in a while, but I was eventually clear and have been for 6 years."

2,"Keep it up! All of us that stopped! """
2,"""This is exactly it. I was a smoker for over a decade, and I tried many times to quit during that period. I never managed to, because I just didn't really want to. I knew that I should but I enjoyed smoking."
2,"Last summer, something just broke in me. I don't even know what the change was, just that suddenly I didn't want to smoke anymore. The cravings still sucked during the withdrawal period but even during the worst of it I had no desire to actually smoke. I'm six months later now and the cravings are mostly gone now."
2,"I strongly believe that people quit when they're ready to quit. No amount of pills or patches will help if you're not there, and if you are there you don't need them."""
2,I wonder if I could just apply this to food. I want to permanently be on smaller portion sizes. It's such a pain.
2,"""That's how my mother quit, cold turkey. It's been almost five years, now. She used to get really sick a few times every winter, to the point of being unable to get out of bed. Since she stopped smoking, she hasn't gotten sick like that once. Now she's feeling better than ever, and was able to take a more active job."""
2,I know a guy who quit cold turkey in his 60s after having smoked since a teenager. One day that was it. No more.
2,Same here. Just one day just quit and never looked back. I also think studies showed within 72 hours the nicotine in your body is already out and cravings should be reduced.
2,"""Honestly, I quit the same way! I had smoked for about 2 years steadily and noticed I was short of breath all the time, and at times just felt like crap.  I had to end it.  I decided my vice was the gas station.  Instead of going in to pay for petrol, I paid at the pump.  Not going inside helped immensely.  I just basically removed myself from being able to buy them. I quit in February and have only had a few with friends at the pub.  The last one I had I only smoked 1/4 of it and it tasted nasty!"""
2,"""Cold Turkey here as well."
2,"Smoked for 5 years. Tried everything myself as well, including electric cigs. I'm 4 months free and i'm a happy possum!"""
2,"""That's how my mum quit. Just gave up, that was about 9 years ago. """
2,"""I agree, cold turkey, but for me it took failing 3 or 4 times before I was able to quit. I always thought I could quit if I really wanted to, but was only after trying and failing 4 times that I realized it had me really bad, and that I couldn't quit. That extra push of in effect being told I can't is what helped me really say FUCK u tabacco and quit for real. Don't stop trying, but go hard for the goal when you do. For the first 2-3 months it really helps if you don't hang around the people you used to smoke with, that's the worst temptation of all. Just make the sacrifice, and tell them why. You'll be back but need a break from hanging out."
2,"Welcome clear lungs, the most amazing taste buds (you haven't eaten food since you started smoking I assure you), and your sense of smell. I can pick a wine in a blind taste test just by smelling it now. Once you've quit for long enough I swear you'll no longer crave a cig at all so no work resisting, and once it's been long enough still you wouldn't even be able to enjoy a puff were you to have one. Go for it people, it's awesome!!"""
2,"""I agree. Granted, I only smoked for 2 years but still... my roommates still both smoked so I always had the urge. For the first week or so, I had to ween myself off.. I would bum a cig or two a day until I didn't want/need them anymore."
2,"Nowadays, I socially smoke. I have a couple good friends that smoke and when they visit, I'll light up one with them for their sake, but I never have the urge to buy smokes anymore. 'Tis a great feeling."""
2,"""I did the same thing. Started smoking when I was 14, quit at 23. Smoked 2 packs a day for most of this period. Decided to stop when I got the flu and went 1 day without smoking. Cold turkey, almost a year ago. Man, the first week is bad, I don't think I slept for more than 2 hours and would think about smoking every 2 minutes. But it goes away, you end up spacing out how much you think about lighting a cigarette. Now I only think about it once or twice a month, usually when I see someone smoking and really enjoying it. Pro tip is: occupy yourself and understand that smoking has a lot to do with anxiety. It's a way of pretending to do something, of filling your time with an activity, be it waiting for the bus or after a nice meal. If you enjoy the actual moment, if you pay attention to yourself and your body, the ways your brain will try to trick you into smoking, all those things, you'll manage to stop. It's funny though, your brain will create the most absurd reasoning for you to have one cigarette - hey man, society ain't the boss of you, why live your life to be healthy, why not enjoy this nice moment with friends by gifting yourself a fine king sized Lucky Strike? - you'll get those moments. But it's useful to learn how much our brain rationalizes stupid choices and it will teach you to pay attention to it in other moments. When slacking off, when making general bad decisions, when you're being an asshole... Most of all, quitting cigarettes involves learning about impulse control and self control, that's why cold turkey is good, because the reward is instant gratification for not smoking. You can count the days, the weeks and the months and know you're winning! Best of luck to whoever is trying to quit and remember: just because you smoked one cigarette while drunk on a Saturday night, it's no reason to buy a pack on Monday morning! """
2,"""There is no question about it. Cold turkey is the way to go. All the different shit you can get to help you quit, is all made by companies out looking for money."""
2,"""Cold turkey here too."
2,"Decide you want to quit. Stop buying cigarettes."""
2,One day I decided not to smoke. At the end of the day I reasoned that if I could get through one day I could get through every day after that. End of story. I don't smoke anymore.

2,I quit cold turkey and it worked for me. It's been about 6 years or so and every once in awhile I'll cough and smell cigarette smoke. The reason I finally quit was the price was getting too high.
2,That is spot the fuck on. 6 years for me after going CT as my new years resolution
2,"""That's pretty much what I had to do.  Granted, I also had to stay away from anything associated with smoking.  Bars? Nope.  Coffee? Nope.  Friends (especially those that smoke)?  Nope.  Just a lot of time spent feeling shitty, lots of naps, and lots of general crankiness. """
2,"""Cold turkey is the only way to go.  If you need a crutch to quit smoking your head is not really where it needs to be to successfully quit."
2,"What finally did it for me was the cost.  Chicago had just raised taxes again on cigarettes so they cost $12/pack.  A $5000/year habit was a bit much so I just said """"fuck it"""" and quit.  If I wavered in my resolve I just thought about the money."
2,"In the end it was not all that hard.  I mean sure, I would jones for a smoke (still do on occasion) but I never flipped out over it and that is after 20+ years of smoking."

2,"At the time that I quit I was smoking 2 packs a day (Kent Golden Light Menthol 100's -- OMG I loved them so much), and there was no patch, no e-cig, no pills. We had the gum and hypnosis, and cold turkey. I chose the latter."
2,"I was a poor college student, living on pennies, when one day I was defrosting the refrigerator (that's how long ago) and saw the brand new carton of cigarettes I had just purchased for $10. (I know). TEN dollars. That was a huge amount of money for me then. Impulsively I took that carton of cigarettes -- brand new, unopened -- and threw it in the garbage with the rest of the old freezer detritus I was disposing of, and hauled it out to the curb."
2,"I did not have $10 to my name to flush down the toilet that way. It made a huge impression on me.

To truely quit you need to remove the psychological addiction as well as the physical addiction.

After 7 years of smoking a pack a day and dozens of failed attempts at quitting I finally figured it out.  Its going to sound stupid but if you read a book called """"The easy way to stop smoking"""" by Allen Carr and you finish the book you will quit smoking.  He basically talks you out of it.

However, if I chose to quit he would hold me to it. I slipped up a couple times at the beginning and some of the worst fights of our relationship ensued. It sucked, but it worked.

DO NOT buy more (avoiding the whole trip to the store for more is waaaay easier than staring at that cigarette and trying not to smoke it). Some people like to carry around the unopened pack, and that may be fine. But I acknowledged my addiction and had to deny myself access. No available cigarette will go unsmoked. I'd typically smoke em down to the filter, so no butts for me. But these May need to be purged prior to the final night/first day."
2,Second- have a reason to stay 'quit!' Develop an activity in which Lung-capacity is a benefit. There are plenty of times I 'get the urge' but enjoy being able to breathe even more. Having something stronger than the urge to smoke to hold on to when you're dying for that puff.

I was a 10+ year pack a day smoker and none of my friends thought I could ever quit. got the book a day after a failed attempt at quitting and I really quit about halfway through reading it (it actually encourages you keep smoking if you still are and to quit when and if you have come to the decision yourself) I did finish the book and proceeded to give a copy to about 6 friends mine who were also smokers. Happy to say 5 of the six are still now non smokers. the 6th has worse drug problems."
2,"The funny thing about reading all of the above posts is how everyone who talks about how great and important will power is in quitting also always mentions how they still miss smoking. Look at the people who quit by understanding that they never needed (what Alan Carr's book shows you) and they never mention or complain about missing smoking. I can 100% honestly tell you that I don't miss it or even really think about it at all after. It was somewhat hard for the first month but now smoking is just something that I realize I started because I was a dumb teenager and stopped because I realized I actually did not need to smoke in order to have fun, go drinking, deal with stress or any of the other things smokers condition themselves into believing that they need cigarettes for."

He wrote them a letter to thank them, and they ended up sending a film crew down and made him their spokesman for about a year. Look up Chantix Herb, and that's my old man. I haven't tried it myself, but that shit works. """
2,"""For me, it was the fact that I paid for Chantix and couldn't use it. I got through the first week fine, but when I got to the """"full dose"""" strength, I would feel nauseated within minutes after taking it, and feel absolutely awful for hours on end."
2,"But, I had already paid the $200 or whatever it was then, so I just forced myself to keep on with the quitting process, because I wasn't willing to throw away $200 like that.  Which is ironic, because I blew $200  every 3-4 months smoking about 2/3 pack a day.  """
2,"""This. I tried patches, gum, cold turkey, etc. All several times. Once on Chantix and I haven't smoked in 4 months. The longest stint before that was 3 weeks during my 25 year pack-a-day habit."""
2,Chantix worked great for me. I miss the cool dreams. No suicide attempt here.
2,"""Chantix for six months worked for me. 35 years smoking those damn things, quitting several times along the way. Been three years, never again. Besides a few strange dreams, no side effects for me."""
2,"""Yep. Champix in Canada. Had awesomely vivid dreams and I got a bit short tempered but it was the EASIEST way for me to quit. And I tried everything. Cold turkey, patches, gum, inhaler, lozenge, Allan Carr, Wellbutrin and finally quit on Champix."
2,It was so easy. I just started barely smoking and then threw out the remainder of the pack.
2,"Unfortunately, two years later I caved and had a drag after being badgered by co-workers who'd forgot I quit. Now I'm on ADD meds and can't take it. Looks like I'll have to do patches and then cold turkey while in Cuba. I loathe American smokes and I found I don't have cravings if they're all that's available."
2,"Convincing myself that I can NEVER have even a drag is the hard part."""
2,"""Chantix was a miracle drug for me. I had some of the most vivid dreams that were so real they were scary, but other than that I had no side effects. I have zero urges to smoke and it's been almost two years. It worked so well I scares me to think of what it did to my brain. """
2,"""Chantix made me angrier than I've ever been, constantly.   I tried it for a few weeks and I just couldn't continue with it.  """
2,"""Wellbutrin did it for me.  Three weeks of pills,  and 14 years later,still no cravings.  """
2,"""Pretty much the same for me. I decided I was tired of going to the doc every month coughing up blood. I took Chantix for three weeks and by the end of the first week I wasn't smoking a single one. By the end of the second week, I didn't even enjoy the smell of a nearby cigarette. After three weeks I just stopped taking the pills and moved on with my life. I still have cravings from time to time (Quit 5.5 years ago.) especially if I have a few beers, but I just have to remind myself that it isn't worth it."""
2,"""Same, Chantix.  After several failures using a variety of other methods (including cold turkey), it was surprisingly easy to quit with Chantix.  I also never took a pill right before bed so I pretty much missed out on the intense dreams.  """
2,"""I took Welbutrin. I kept smoking for the first week, and I kid you not after that week, cigarettes tasted disgusting and every time I smoked one I didn't know why I was doing it. (My brain wasn't getting the nicotine so I was smoking without the pleasurable feeling I was used to.)"
2,"Now a days I can be around people that smoke, or even smoke a cigarette myself but I still don't get that same feeling that kept me smoking for so many years."""
2,I tried Chantix and it destroyed my will to live.
2,"""I tried Chantix, but then dreamt of eating a dead baby fetus.....decided cold turkey was the way to go."""
2,"""Chantix is the only thing that worked for me. It took awhile, a few attempts while on and off of it.. but it worked. getting off the chantix is it's own weirdness, but not hard just weird. It's difficult to describe in vivid details, but with Chantix I slept awesome, had great dreams, and felt generally swell. but when I quit, my sleep got more restless (waking up occasionally, having a little bit more trouble falling asleep), and sometimes when waking I would a bit off, like something was wrong. That abated after a few months though."
2,"One strange thing I experienced when I first stopped smoking cigarettes on Chantix (though I don't think it is relevant to this).. I felt like I need a """"boost"""" every now and then.

2,"""I can't speak for myself, so I'll tell my dad's story. He smoked for most of his life, and had a heart attack. The doctor's advised him to quit, and he tried, he really did. Patches didn't work. Gum didn't work. So he always went back to smoking."
2,"Until he needed a heart bypass operation. He had a meeting with the surgeon who told him """"if you don't stop smoking completely in 3 months time I will not do the operation. If you don't have this operation you will not live to see your son grow up. You probably won't see Christmas."""""
2,"Worked a treat for him. As I recall, research suggests that gum, patches, etc. all feed the craving, and the most successful quitters were those who went cold turkey. I could probably find a source for that if necessary."""

2,"For me I always """"caved"""" because I was so use to using the cigarette as a way to take a 5 minute break from whatever pissed me off.  When I finally quit for good I had to use the patch.  I followed there system and it worked."
2,"Basically it let me focus on the habit and not the addiction.  Once the habit part was dealt with the going from 12mg/24 hours -> none was very easy. (I think its 12mg for the last step, I can't recall)."

2,"I honestly could see myself either finding another surgeon or go so mad that I just wouldn't have the operation."""
2,"""I am aiming for zero nicotine but if I ever go back to it after that, it will only ever be to ecigs. That is rarely the case with patches/gum, so you will need to wait for proper research before you can update your mental module accurately on this one."
2,"Different things work for different people but nicotine is about as harmful as caffeine for most (not such a good idea long-term for people with heart, kidney or liver disease, or diabetes). If you're going to worry about nicotine addiction you really need to worry about caffeine too and as for alcohol, it's off the scale of harm compared."
2,"ecigs break the MAOI addiction that you get with tobacco, and they provide an enjoyable alternative to smoking. If you don't get why smokers smoke then you won't get it anyway. But ecigs could wipe out tobacco altogether in a generation, and we should want that to happen. Hypothetical fears based on different sources of nicotine which smokers do not enjoy taking aren't a counter-argument."""
2,"""Glad that worked for him. Didn't work for my Dad, he just started smoking again after the bypass."""
2,"""I had to quit both coffee, and my 2-3 beer a day habit when I was exposed to some toxic chemicals at work. Eventually, the BP dropped, but the insane craving for those few beers drove me nuts. There was an AA group close by, free coffee, which I shouldn't have been drinking much of, and people whose life sucked much worse than mine when they had to quit."
2,"I suppose it was like that Fight Club thing. Think your life sucks? Check out these people! Thing was, I used to drink a whole whole hell of a lot more. That step from 9-12 beers a day to 2 or 3 was a hell of a lot easier that going to totally nothing, even if I got sick when I drank just one beer. Ug!"
2,"Anyway, better now, sort of. ;) Took the liver about 6-7 months to fix itself, a very grueling period of sobriety and hating life.

2,I quit in 2008 after smoking for 23 years. What did it for me was a huge price increase. Like $1.00 a pack. I got so **pissed off** that I was paying *so much money* to essentially kill myself that I was able to quit cold turkey.
2,Quit in 2004. By then a pack in Sweden was 7 dollars.

2,"""Alan Carr's easy way to quit smoking. Great book, read it once and have been quit for 4 years."""
2,[deleted]
2,Easy way to stop smoking by Allan Carr. I quit twice using this book and so did all my friends. Highly recommend it to any smoker.
2,"""It worked for my wife and I. I'm not sure how, but it took the stress out of it completely."""
2,"""I quit smoking about 9 million times before I was successful - that makes me an expert, right? My personal research (focused on former smokers with at least a year of non-smoking under their belts) led me to the solid conclusion that **cold turkey is the method that almost all successful non-smokers use** (95% or so if I remember my stats correctly). Do your own research, define what you think of as success in those searches."
2,Here are some things that I went through to help me wrapped up as advice:
2,"First, **get comfortable with the idea of being a non-smoker.** Spend some time imagining what it will be like to stop smoking. Daydream about it. Practice turning down cigarettes in your mind. Let it be what you think about in the shower and as you drift to sleep at night. If you meditate - meditate on breathing better, being able to run, having white teeth, being morally superior to your smoking friends, or whatever about being a non-smoker is attractive to you."
2,Then **commit to being a non-smoker**. Decide that you're going to become that daydream that you're having. That doesn't mean throwing down your pack and trying to see if your will or the drug is stronger. It means knowing balls to bones that this is what you're going to do.
2,During this time **start cutting out some places that you smoke**. For me I stopped smoking in my car. Then I stopped smoking inside while at home. Then I stopped smoking at work. This was all a process that I went through for months.
2,"**Decide on a date.** Think of it as your new birthday. On your new birthday get rid of all your smoking stuff. Give it away, throw it away, burn it if that means something to you. that means lighters, ash Trays, cigarettes."
2,**Avoid places where you went to smoke.** That means changes in your life awhile. Plan 6 months or a year. Smoking areas are off limits to you just like bars are off limits to an alcoholic.
2,"When you have those moments where you think you'll have to cave - pray if you're inclined, take a timeout, go to your car and scream for a minute, take a jog, code, eat celery, pick your nose - **do something, anything besides smoke.** The craving will pass."
2,"**Repeat the daydream in your head, often.** The withdrawal is only temporary. It's like having a bad case of the flu - It will suck, but you'll get over it."
2,Stay done. Realize that **you can't argue with addiction**. There is no reasonable amount of smoking. There isn't a peaceable middle ground between smoking and not. Stick to it.
2,"**If you slip up, so what?** Throw that pack away too. Go back to the daydream of being a non-smoker. One slip isn't failure - each time you've quit before has prepared you for this. Put your quitting shoes back on."
2,"**Look at the benefits of quitting.** Look them up, read about them, think about them, cherish them."
2,"I doubt you'll get this given the thousands of responses, but maybe it will help someone."
2,"Edit: words did and didn't happen."""
2,Quitting smoking is easy! I did it 20 times last year.
2,"""I worked as smoking cessation counselor back in the day.  Some things to keep in mind."
2,* Most people attempt to quit 7-9 times before being successful (defined as at least 6 months without smoking.  Having failed at quitting several times is actually good--it means you're on the right track of working out when and how to quit.
2,"* there's two aspects to smoking: behavioral and physical.  You can treat the physical with nicotine gum, patches, or gradually reducing your smoke intake before a quit day.  Behavioral also requires strategy--find some thing you can do when you want to smoke. Whenever and however you can change your habits is a big help."
2,"* in the end, it all comes down to gutting it out. There are some tips and tricks that make it a little easier, but it's 99% guts. """
2,"""Am I right in saying that even if you're ingesting nicotine, say with gum or patches, for those 6 months, you're still considered """"successful""""? I think that's the only reason """"studies"""" show that nicotine replacements work."""
2,How would one find a smoking cessation counselor?
2,"""After reading Allen carrs book and quitting easily without having to try and fail again and use patches or other nicotine replacements, I think these methods are vastly inferior to his. Why make it hard on yourself. The physical part is almost non existent. Its all in our heads. """
2,"""Which is exactly why vaping is so successful, since it replaces the behavioral aspect while also providing the physical aspect."""
2,"""It isn't just nicotine addiction that comes along with smoking, it's habits. Routines. I would have a cigarette before class, during breaks, and after class. I'd have a cigarette after a big meal, with my morning coffee, etc. Start breaking these habits. I would first stop smoking when I was going to/from class. Then gradually break more of these habits as you go along. I also started running to aid in the inevitable weight gain -- it's also gratifying when you can run for a half hour straight without dying from the lack of breath. I hope this helps! I honestly never thought I'd be able to quit and it's been over six months now. You can do it!"""
2,"""These kinds of actions helped me quit the last time. For me if was no more smoking in the car, and then no smoking until all of my work was done. This lead me to realize I viewed smoking as a reward. That's like rewarding yourself by having someone rub your face in asbestos."""
2,"""This is exactly what I did. Some people aren't able to go this route, but I found that slowly cutting out each smoking habit helped me immensely. I started by not smoking in my car, then not smoking at lunch, and eventually progressed to only smoking 1 cigarette a day. Running helps too! It feels great to progress and be able to breathe while working out."""
2,"""Also, MAOIs present in tobacco enhance nicotine addiction, too. So, that also comes with smoking."""
2,Did you ever end up gaining weight since you decided to run to combat it? This is one of the things I'm worried about. But I do love running!
2,"""I just passed my [1000th day without a cigarette](http://www.sigbanners.com/reddit/75.png). I couldn't have done it without vaping. Electronic cigarettes, when given enough power and enough nicotine (if it looks like a cigarette, it's probably too weak on both counts) give you a better 'smoke' than tobacco does, and actually smoking would be a step down on all counts."
2,"*edit: linky"""
2,"""Complete change of environment and habits. I quit my job. I doing so I had the chance to change my entire daily schedule. With no habitual smoking breaks, I dropped it without a problem. It was really just the habit, not the addiction for me. """

It wasn't the typical """"YOUR LUNGS WILL BE BLACK AND FALL APART IF YOU SMOKE"""" bit rather a real world example that hit very close to home.  This was a man that I viewed as a strong leader and now he was barely over 100 pounds and couldn't even lift his head on his own.  I stopped cold turkey that night and haven't looked back. I have a brother who still smokes and at his rate he won't live to see 60, which means he only has 25 years left with us.

2,"""Honestly, the idea of dying younger doesn't bother me. It's the idea of having an awful quality of life, maybe having a leg amputated or a lung removed, for 15 years before I die that bothers me."""
2,One word E-cig
2,When my desire to smoke a cigarette was less than driving out in the middle of a tropical storm to get another pack. Then I realized how much I didn't want a cigarette after the storm cleared.
2,"""I heard an interview with a medical researcher who had just released a paper claiming that if you stop smoking at 30 then your prospects of a long life are not significantly changed by the fact that you once smoked. I was 33 at the time and I realised that I had a chance to turn things around, and do it now before it was too late as I was already beyond the mark..."
2,"And then a few months later I met my wife to be who was totally anti-smoking. If I had smoked that day when we first met (yes, it was a real Hollywood like love at first sight moment!) she would not have paid me any attention. This removed any risk at all of me reverting to my smoking ways. Yes, I struggled with the want to smoke, but I had found something soooo much better, a woman that loved me and a prospect of a long life. Simples!"""
2,"""I just quit for the second time, and I'm excited to share my story!"
2,"Saturday will be the 3-week anniversary of the last time I had cigarette smoke in my lungs, I did it easily with e-cigs."
2,"January 9, 2014 my wife picks me up at work as usual (we are currently sharing one car) and she begins to tell me about her day, including that she had filled the gas tank.  I quickly look around for my cigarettes because she usually picks them up for me when she fuels up.  She sees me looking around and asks """"Aren't you going to go get one of those e-cigs you were talking about?"""""
2,"D'oh!  I had mentioned the idea of trying one in passing earlier in the week and didn't realize she would have taken the comment to heart.  Reluctantly, I gave in. """"Yeah, I guess..."""""
2,"So we drive to Vaporz, the nearest vape shop in town.  I knew I wanted a PV (personal vaporizer) over a typical e-cig that you could buy at every convenience store in town, simply because of the success/failure rate of both that I have personally seen from friends, acquaintances, and co-workers that have tried quitting using an electronic substitute."
2,"At the shop, I was greeted by an exuberant hipster-type guy who seemed way too chipper for the attempt at a major life change I was about to make.  After explaining my situation to him, he presented me with this starter kit:"
2,http://i.imgur.com/4FW3izn.jpg
2,"He then asked me how much I smoked.  Admittedly, it wasn't much comparatively to some people... about 1/3 pack a day.  He suggested medium-strength fluid (11mg Nicotine per ml) and asked what flavor I would like to go with my starter kit."
2,"Determined to not set myself up for failure, I asked for the Marlboro flavored fluid."
2,"When I got home that evening, I had a smoke before I went inside then proceeded to examine my new gadgets.  I filled the tanks on the PVs as he had instructed, attached the batteries, and started puffing.  """"Not too bad."""" I thought to myself, and continued to use it the remainder of the evening."
2,"The next morning was the real test.  Major trigger for me is just getting out of bed in the morning.  Nicotine starved, running out to the porch the first thing in the morning to get my fix has been part of my daily ritual for over a decade.  Still determined not to fail, and subsequently losing my previous night's investment (about $50), I fired up the PV and started sucking on it like... well, like something that sucks a lot."
2,I wasn't satisfied.
2,"I still had about 5 cigs left in my pack of American Spirits, so I slid one out, stepped outside, and lit up."
2,"There it was, the *rush*.  The feeling you get when you light that first cig up in the morning, the rush to the head, the burn in the throat, the satisfaction that you and your body just *craves*."
2,"I butt it out and go inside to a disappointed wife.  I explain to her that there are different nicotine levels in the fluids they sell at the vape shop and that I wanted to return for stronger juice.  She agreed, more eager than I am for me to quit smoking and quit stinking like smoke, ash, and tobacco."
2,"The happy hipster is there again, and I explain my dilemma.  The nicotine level is too low.  Also the Marlboro flavor has that weird, sweet aftertaste which is what steered me to American Spirits in the first place.  After a short discussion about the strength of the cigs I smoke vs. the amount I smoke, I leave the shop with three new bottles of juice.  Two bottles of Camel tobacco flavor and one bottle of cinnamon, all in 24mg strength."
2,"At home I empty out and reload my PVs, one with Camel and the other with cinnamon.  I tried the cinnamon one first, it hit my throat like a truck.  It actually *felt* like smoking.  The Camel tasted more like the cigs I'm used to then the old juice did, and didn't have quite as harsh of a """"throat hit""""."
2,"My solution? I mixed the two.  The end result tastes like Hot Tamale candy-flavored cig, which is great since I love cinnamon.  However, I knew the real test would be the next morning."
2,"The next day, sitting at my computer, I fire up the PV (for the most part, it's odorless so my wife approves my use indoors).  The drags are satisfying but didn't quite get as much of that rush as I had hoped."
2,"Again, I slip out one of the remaining 4 cigs I have, step outside, and light up."
2,"I'm discouraged and disgusted at this point. I know I won't be able to keep it up. I know I'll regress into smoking full-time. I keep puffing on the cig, waiting to the rush I know will come."
2,It doesn't.
2,???
2,"I realize as I'm standing on the porch, looking at my half-smoked cig, that I took my morning hits at my computer... *sitting down*.   Usually, my first smoke will make me dizzy, sometimes to the point of stumbling when I try to walk back inside.  Only after I sit for a bit and when my body is used to having the nicotine flowing around (usually just a minute or two) do I become stable again.  I know sitting with my PV greatly reduced that initial dizziness that I normally get when I'm standing on the porch.  I take my half-smoked cig and snuff it."
2,"Wife is sitting inside, wondering if I wasted more money buying the stronger juice.  She is ecstatic as I grab the remaining 3 1/2 cigs I have and crush them into the garbage can."
2,"I haven't smoked since, and I'm confident that I can vape without wanting to go back to cigarettes indefinitely."
2,-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2,"I also want to add that since I've started vaping, I've done some research into the matter and here are some key points that I've learned."
2,"1. Nicotine is *not* a carcinogen.  The 4000+ other chemicals in cigarette smoke is what causes lung cancer, not the nicotine. As a stimulant, nicotine in doses in the amount a regular PV delivers, is roughly the same risk as caffeine."
2,"2. Secondhand vapor from a PV has 1/10 the nicotine levels of secondhand cigarette smoke, 1/7th the particulate matter, and negligible trace amounts of anything else."
2,3. Vapor dissipates much faster than smoke and is virtually odorless.  I noticed an improvement of my ability to smell and taste after about 3-4 days of vaping.
2,"Additionally, I talked my dad into trying vaping.  I told him to go to a reputable brick-and-mortar (B&M) vape shop and talk to a salesperson so he can see and maybe even try different options.  I think it's better than trying to go it alone via mail-order.  He switched back and forth between cigs and vaping for a several days then quit cigs entirely.  He is about 1 1/2 weeks cigarette free as of today, from a 3 to 3 1/2 pack-a-day smoker."
2,"Hopefully, my story can be helpful and inspiring to you or someone else who reads this. This is why I took the time to write it all out."
2,[Edit: I also wanted to add that I opted for the starter kit with 2 PVs because I knew if I had downtime waiting for a battery to charge I would be climbing the walls before it was ready to be used again]
2,"**TL;DR:**  Not all e-cigs are created equal. A good vape shop and some common sense decision making can find a satisfying  alternative to smoking."""
2,Replying so I can find this again tomorrow.
2,"""Willpower. I had yet another month where I had still some month left at the end of my money and I said to myself: That's it. I quit. I'm so done with this shit. Never touched a cig again, now 2 months off them."""

2,"""How did you know you were having one? What brought it on?"
2,"I'd imagine you would need to be either predisposed or lead a very inactive lifestyle to bring that on, but it is good you quit."""
2,"""I started smoking at age 13 and stopped smoking at age 42.  I am 46 years old and haven't had one in 4 years.

2,"""Eventually, you're going to find that the most effective way to quit is to just stop."
2,"I never tried or bothered to pick a date for my quit. Part of me knew that I had to stop soon before any of the major health effects started taking place. (I was already getting bronchitis virtually every time I'd catch a cold; so that was kind of a warning sign...) Then one morning, I woke up and said to myself, """"Fuck it. Today is just as a good a day as any."""" I suppose that helped with any kind of anticipation towards a quit date. Some people like to try to reduce first. Frankly, I think that just starts the pain early before it even takes full force. Here. Let me just stab you in the legs a little bit before I cut them off with this rusty saw. I've always had something of an all or nothing mentality. If you're going to quit, don't bullshit yourself. Just stop. To anyone who is/was one to two pack a day smoker, you know well this concept seems easier said than done. Dig deep."
2,"I think the worse part of quitting was the concept of quitting more-so than just the cravings themselves. Before, my mind would calm down a bit knowing """"Hey. Just an hour or two and then you can get a smoke in to relax a bit."""" The realization would set in: """"You're never going to be able to smoke again."""" At that moment, my mind would start to freak out. After a few weeks of this, I was beginning to wonder if I was going to end up living out the rest of my life in a constant frustrated agony of good and bad days. Shouldn't this have subsided by now? The cravings don't feel like they've become lesser or weaker at all. Nothing has fuckign changed! How is this better?! All I think about is when next time I'll ever be able to grab a fucking smoke again. If this was my fucking option, maybe I was just better off smoking. Whoever said that the withdrawal only lasts three days needs to be beaten into a bloody pulp."
2,"Those first three weeks were probably the shittiest three weeks of my life; going through chemical and psychological withdrawals. For me, I felt high as hell those first two days. It wasn't a good high either. I'm guessing that was my body relearning how to release glucose on its own again without help. Stinger energy gels became a staple in my diet. I would have made Wilford Brimley cry. After that, it became the psychological craving battle. Frankly, it was hard to distinguish between chemical cravings and psychological ones. The chemical ones were more intense, but the psychological ones were more frequent. Any kind of stimulant only made the cravings more intense. Monster energy drinks became a big no-no. I'm on Concerta for ADHD, and HOLY FUCK did those ever multiply the cravings. Looking back now, I probably should have taken a vacation from those as well. They likely made my withdrawal substantially worse than what most people will ever experience. (If you're on Concerta or Ritalin and you smoke, you probably have some idea of what I'm talking about. Methylphenidate can [usually does] turbocharge any addictive tendencies you may have.)"
2,"You want to know when you realize you actually are an addict? When you're trying to quit and you see half of a lit cigarette on the ground that someone tossed away in the street, and picking it up for a few hauls seems like a decent and reasonable idea. It's odd too because you never really feel the moment when you're free. It could take a few days; realistically a few weeks; or possibly a few months. Everyone has a different clock. Then magically, one day you're going to wake up and realize """"Wow... I haven't had a nicotine craving in over a week."""" This eventually becomes, """"I don't remember the last time I had a craving."""" For a while, the only thing memorable was the infuriating madness of craving just one more burn. Hell, just a drag. One drag won't hurt, right? Yea. Lets fuck up three weeks of torture and start all over again. Seems like a fan-fucking-tastic idea."
2,"Freedom is a great thing. It's not a quick thing, but it does eventually come. That was always my biggest fear. You begin to notice that you're capable of feeling lucid and focused without getting a quick burn in to help you out before hand. Think of it like getting better from being sick. There's no sudden """"AH HA!"""" moment. It's a progression. Think back to when you were at your most miserable from something like a hangover or food poisoning. Now think about how you feel at this very moment. When you're feeling that awful, you want nothing more than to just feel NOT miserable. If you're not feeling sick and awful right now, you've won. You've achieved what you wanted some time ago. Take a moment to cherish that feeling. The concept is the same, only now you're directly responsible for the outcome. It's funny too, because victory requires the absence of doing anything."

2,"""I smoked a pack a day for 5 years. I quit by using Welbutrin. It made the effects of smoking negligible to me. I'd smoke but I didn't get a rush. Nothing at all. I went through withdrawals. I freaked out at work, yelling at a coworker. I was almost sent home for the day. I remember the withdrawals peaking on the third night. I was in a fetal position screaming into the carpet in my living room. Once I hit that hurdle, I kept on with the Welbutrin, but only for a couple weeks because I was warned that Welbutrin itself is addictive. Note that many people will tell you that Welbutrin is a bad drug, but I think they may be confusing its side effects with nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Also, Welbutrin gets a lot of bad press from people who are using it to treat their mental illness, and I don't trust their feedback. So yeah, welbutrin did it for me."
2,"Something to note is that once you do quit, you'll still want to smoke. Like all the time, at first. But if you can sit back and observe the addiction - the urge - for what it is and not act on it, you'll do fine. Next, note that you'll need to readjust your life. Like what do you do right after a meal now that you quit? What do you do when you're just standing around outdoors? (We had no smartphones when I quit) What I'm getting at is that you'll feel oddly uncomfortable with cigarette's absence, but you'll adjust."
2,"One last point. Not smoking makes you more attractive. Also, my wife tells me that when I smoked, I smelled not just like smoke, which is gross unto itself, but I also smelled like shit.

So when the inevitable day 30 came around and my one smoke turned into two packs the shortness of breath came back with a vengeance.

2,
2,"- You'll need about four days, so take two days off from work/school before or after the weekend."
2,- Do not drink alcohol on those days / Do not drink much (or at all) during the first few weeks of not smoking
2,"- Allow yourself to eat whatever you want on those first four days, so go and buy all your favorite snacks first."
2,- Smoke your last cigarette before going to bed and make sure that there are none left in your house. You'll wake up on day 1/4 and never smoke one again.
2,"- The best way to stop is to do things you usually don't do. Take walks, go jogging, drive somewhere (if you never smoked in your car), go swimming, work out. Eat and drink a lot."
2,
2,"That's basically all there is to it. It's really important that you plan this and take your time off from things for the first few days. If you try to go about your usual daily business but """"just without smoking"""" you will most likely fail. Remember, smoking is a habit. You are always smoking in the same situations, like waiting for the bus, having lunch break at work, etc. so you need as many new situations as possible for the transition."
2,
2,"Edit: I smoked for 16 years, two packs a day for the last few years, and quit that way."""
2,"""I smoked for 15 years. At the height of my addiction, I was smoking two packs a day. I tried quitting 6 times before I was finally successful and it was Nicoderm patches that finally got me through."
2,"Quitting is problematic in two ways: first you have the actual physical addiction. It's a pain in the ass. For me, trying to quit cold turkey (without a nicotine supplement) raised my anxiety levels and would ultimately lead to ridiculous justifications for smoking """"just one cigarette."""""
2,"The second problem is the mental addiction. For me (and everyone I know who has quit), this is by FAR the hardest aspect of quitting smoking. When you smoke as much as I did, cigarettes are part of your life. They aren't a thing that you do to relax or for fun (the social smoker excuse), they are a habit so integrally wound into your life that you will have one hell of a hard time breaking it. I had a few triggers that I learned to identify through my failed attempts at quitting smoking. 1) I wanted a cigarette right after every meal. I never found a good solution to this one, although the wave of public smoking bans helped keep me from smoking after meals at restaurants. 2) I like to join other smokers outside for smoke breaks. If you've never been a smoker or if you're just not socially awkward, you probably don't understand this one. But there really is something comforting about smoke break social time. 3) This was the hardest. I liked to smoke when I used my computer. Whether it be gaming or...other activities....I would chain smoke when I was at my computer. When I finally quit smoking, I shut my computer down, thoroughly cleaned my computer desk of all ashes and ash trays, and then covered it with a sheet. I didn't touch my computer for three weeks after that because I knew if I did, that mental addiction would kick in and make me more likely to relapse.  There were other triggers too, those are just the highlights. What you have to do is find ways to break your habits and squash those triggers. It will mean that you have to change other aspects of your life besides just giving up cigarettes. If you really want to quit though, you'll do it. It's worth it."
2,"I grew up in the south on a tobacco farm. Smoking is a tradition in my family (so is lung cancer). Over the last decade I have watched 90% of my surviving family try to quit smoking cold turkey with no assistance (patches, counselling, etc) Every single one of them has failed. Some of them have failed numerous times. The same can be said for most of my friends who have tried to quit cold turkey without assistance. In fact, I can remember only one friend who was successful, but he had only smoked about a half a pack a day for a year."
2,"My best advice for you is to seek some type of assistance. For me, the patches helped tremendously. They almost completely staved off the physical addiction. I was able to work on breaking the habit (the mental addiction) without the added anxiety of the physical addiction. If you decide to go with patches, be sure you follow the step down plan completely. Don't tell yourself that you can rush through it to save money. Spend a little extra now and save yourself some money in healthcare costs later. Step down gradually and give yourself time to adjust. Also, you may not want to wear the patches at night. They gave me fucked up dreams and often I found myself unable to sleep well. So i took the patch off at night and applied a fresh one first thing in the morning. Lastly, I know the patches may irritate your skin a bit. They do burn a bit when you first put them on. If you can, work through it. It's worth it."
2,"I also know many people who have gone through extensive counseling and have used medication to quit. Many of them have been successful as well. In fact, if I were quitting today, I would certainly explore that avenue. Smokefree.gov lists counseling with medication as one of the most effective means of smoking cessation (http://smokefree.gov/explore-quit-methods)."
2,"No matter what you decide to do, you have got to start telling yourself right now that you will quit. You don't """"want"""" to quit. You """"WILL"""" quit. And do not ever fool yourself into thinking that you can have just one cigarette. I don't care if you quit for 4 weeks and decide that one smoke isn't going to kill you. Once you've been addicted, one cigarette will lead to justifications that you can have one cigarette per week. Then it will be one every other day. Then one per day.  After ten years of being smoke free, I absolutely refuse to let myself have a single cigarette. I've wanted them. Even now I find myself craving them occasionally."
2,"So consider something to help with the physical addiction. Patches, medication, something. I'm not sure if I'd recommend e-cigs because then you don't really break the habit of having a cigarette in hand. I guess they are still slightly better than filling your lungs with smoke though. It's a fucking hard battle, my friend. It's worth it though. Good luck!"

2,"""I smoked for 16 years and just quit one year ago.  I know it is for good because I decided in my mind I was no longer a smoker.  Once you decide that way, smoking a cigarette makes you feel kind of guilty instead of relaxed and calmed."
2,"It also helped me to know that cigarette cravings are temporary.  They really are.  You can be sweating out an intense craving, then get a phone call and totally forget about it.  This is fairly unique to cigarettes.  As time goes by the craving will come less and less often.  After a month or so, you will notice cigarette smoke smells much different.  It smells really bad.  Instead of reminding you of smoking a cigarette, it will remind you of how bad cigarettes are, and how much they smell they leave in your hands, clothes, hair and breath.  How impossible it is to hide that smell.  I have a couple of friends that I cannot even ride in their car because the smoke smell is so bad."
2,"During the first month, give yourself lots of stuff to do.  I would go walk up to a convenience store and get a large 44oz Iced tea full of ice (summer).  Something to drink, and lots of ice to chew on afterward.  Also went through a ton of gum and chewed on stuff like toothpicks, straws, and basically anything I could get my hands on.  If you choose a patch or nicotine gum, I think this makes it more difficult because the withdrawal period is prolonged instead of """"getting over it"""" quickly.  At least in my experiences I found the gum just reminded me more of cigarettes and didn't give me enough nicotine to get the """"relaxation"""" part of a cigarette.  I recommend staying away from smoker friends, particularly if alcohol is involved for the first month. Throw out or give away ALL cigarettes and ashtrays.  Then tell any smoker friends you have you are quitting and to try to not smoke around you (all of my smoker friends were very supportive)."
2,"Finally, if you do not regularly go to the gym and workout I would recommend giving it a shot.  This is a great time for change, and surrounding yourself with healthy people is very empowering."
2,"If you are the type of person that is motivated by progress check out this [chart] (http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html).  Everything will get better I promise.

I had read about how it was so difficult to quit that I had already decided it was very hard; when I actually did it was easier than my preconceived notions.

2,"-I made sure they didn't fall within old routine habits, but the """"Lunch"""" smoke was hard.  Driving was hard as well, but my commute is really short."
2,"-Next, I started waiting as long as I could before I NEEDED a smoke.  I did that every single one I had so that it wasn't at all habitual, but more like an as-needed med.  I was very careful to not have any of them become a new routine."
2,"**First big milestone.  I think this is about 2 months in, give or take.  I really don't remember."
2,"-I then decided I would only have 1 per day, with an emergency backup smoke.  I worked in nicotine lozenges, and kept with the mindset of it being medication.  I would still wait as long as possible.  I was stern with myself, so that if I pussed out and had one at 10am, I would not second guess myself and even THINK that i can just have the 2nd one later.  It was really for when I started to get really uncomfortable, crabby, etc.  It had to be that way."
2,-I quickly moved to only having one emergency smoke available a day.
2,"-I started to purposefully think of smoking as nasty, and would try to put myself in a grouchy mood when smoking, focusing my angst on the smoke.  Seems lame, but it got me through."
2,"**Second big milestone was after two weeks of the lozenge/smoke and then just lozange, I could DEAL with it.  I think I ended up having .5 to 1 smoke a week.  Shortly after that I had surgery, so I COULDN'T smoke for a couple weeks.  The last* one I had was September 14th, 2007."
2,"**First big setback.  I had been on Roxicet, and it messed me up pretty good.  I then had a really hard time after I quit taking it, and was pretty depressed.  I had some bad luck with my car, getting stranded twice when I wasn't supposed to exert myself and yadda yadda.  So I smoked a 1/2 one here... and another one there...  This is why I gave an asterisk to my quit date.  I tried to make them very deliberate, but it's not easy when you just don't care.  Once i was out of my funk, that was that. I'd guess I had 2 to 4 smokes (each smoked twice) over two weeks."
2,"-Once I got my head back together, I realized I really didn't care for the stink on other at work.  I realized I could smell and taste things better.  I didn't feel like shit when I woke up in the mornings.  I started to REALLY feel better.  I had earlier, but not like this."
2,"**Third milestone - I quit DREAMING about smoking.  I didn't have one in my hand, """"dream me"""" would be bothered by others smoking.  If I DID have a smoke in my dream, I would wake up PISSED!  Then I'd realize it was just a dream, and be only mildly pissed."
2,"Now I NEVER dream about smoking.  I might have had one dream a couple years ago.  I had a kid a few years back, and there have been random weird moments when I thought, """"Man, I could go for a smoke.""""  I never did, and only actually considered it a couple times.  Thing is, I won't touch a cigar or anything.  Any slip can set me back years or get me smoking again.  That helps keep me in check."
2,"One unmentioned bonus somewhere in here is that the smoking policy at work changed.  You couldn't smoke on the grounds, and it's about a mile drive to get out.  That helped at some point, since my break smokes were simply not an option."

2,Vaping.
2,"""Little bit of background:"
2,"I had my first cigarette in 5th grade, had about 1 a week to be """"cool"""" up until 6th grade, then started smoking addictively in seventh grade. I got up to a pack a day by the summer following eighth grade. I kept that going until last year, which was my junior year. So I smoked for about 4 years adictively, 7 if you want to count my """"experimental"""" phase."
2,"First thing's first, don't expect it to be easy, and don't expect the urge to go away. My first time quitting was my sophomore year, didn't go well at all. I made it about 2 weeks in and I was mad because I was expecting the urge to want a cigarette to go away. That's when I found out that wanting to smoke sticks with you for life, it doesn't just magically go away, just like every other addiction. It gets a lot easier, but certain things will always make you have an extreme craving for a cigarette. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you can quit."
2,"Like I said, my first attempt to quit was failed due to frustration. My second failed attempt was at the end of my sophomore year. I made it about 3 months before summer started. In summer, I found myself getting REALLY bored. One of the things that make me want to smoke is getting REALLY bored, so eventually I broke. Turns out the """"Cold Turkey"""" approach just wasn't cutting it."
2,"At the end of my junior year my Mom bought me an e-cigarette (I was 17 at the time, she knew I smoked, and while she didn't like it she knew she wasn't going to be able to stop me, so she did the best she could to help me quit. It also helped that she was also a smoker at the time.) This worked absolute wonders for a few months, but every time I hung out with my pals (Who are all smokers), I'd end up bumming a few off of them."
2,"In the end, I bumped up my nicotine level. It's really trading one addiction for the other. Using 24 mg juice helped me fully quit, although the urge was still there, when I had it I would just bust out my e-cig and hit it constantly. I'm not here to preach about how amazing e-cigs are, because in the end they are still harmful (Putting foreign chemicals into your body), but they are MUCH less harmful than cigarettes. Not to mention a lot more convenient and cheaper (Although FDA taxes are coming very soon, so it will get much more expensive)"
2,"After I was able to fully give up the cigarettes for the e-cig, I devised a plan to slowly ween myself off the nicotine. Starting at 24 mg, I decided every 2 weeks I would drop down a level. So on my 3rd week I got 18 mg instead of 24. 2 weeks later, I got 16 instead of 18, so on and so forth. It's worked extremely well, and while I still crave a cigarette due to certain triggers, I can still overcome the urge."
2,"Mainly the key is to have the correct mind set. I read some article on the internet a while ago that after 3 days without a cigarette your physical addiction is gone. I'm not sure how accurate that is, but if it's true that means that you only have a mental addiction after 3 days. This means that any withdrawal symptoms you may be experiencing should go away. I personally didn't have any symptoms other than one hell of a cough, but that subsided rather quickly. The rest is up to you in order to keep under control."
2,"Next time you decide to quit, make sure you know that the urge won't go away. If you expect it to, when it comes back it will catch you off guard. It might take every bit of willpower in your body, but when the urge comes around, do your best to get your mind off of it. Try to avoid smokers for the first bit of time; they are essentially your biggest trigger at first. Know that quitting is a process, not an immediate thing. You won't wake up one day and be all """"I'M CUREDDDDDDDDDDD"""" and start dancing like you're some character from Mary Poppins. It simply won't happen, so don't expect it, and don't get discouraged when it doesn't."
2,"I know this was a really long post, but the issue hits home for me, and I really hope this helps. Good luck."""
2,"""I only smoked for around three years, but it was consistent enough. For the latter two years I was smoking a pack a day or thereabouts, but from time to time my habit lulled."
2,"I decided to quit when I woke up with a noticeable wheeze one morning a few days before NYE. It's been almost a month since I've smoked - cold turkey, because that's the only way I can break habits - and let me tell you, I'm on the verge of driving a schoolbus full of orphans off a bridge, that's how much I want to smoke.

2,After that weekend things got better slowly everyday.  After a couple weeks I barely felt anything.  After a couple years it feels like a distant memory.

2,"No, I don't mean """"Gee, I should really quit - it's horrendously bad for me, and expensive, and and and""""...  Those are **rationalisations**.  I mean that you actually *want* to do it - badly enough that you'd volunteer to walk into a biker bar dressed in the colours of an opposing club and pick a fight with the biggest dude there if that would help."
2,"Once you've got that down, there are a few things that will help:"
2,"* Pick a date on which to quit that means something to you; anniversary, birthday, end of financial year, or whatever."
2,* TELL everyone in advance that you are going to do it on that date.  Now you look like a wimp if you don't make a good effort.  Shame is a great motivator.
2,"* When the day comes, on the first second of that day if you're still awake, put your last butt out, screw up the packet, and throw that and your lighter/matches in the bin.  Preferably in front of witnesses.  By showing everyone else you mean it, you've also sent a message to your own subconcious."
2,* Do NOT use gum or patches.  These things simply maintain your nicotine addiction while letting your lungs clean - you might as well just switch to e-cigarettes.  You want to stop using then grow a pair and  fucking STOP!
2,"* Remember that every day, even at the height of your addiction, you have managed to go 8 hours without a smoke - you sleep.  That means that that craving you get every few minutes after a half hour is just your pussy brain being a whining bitch.  Tell it to STFU - you have better things to do than standing out in the rain sucking vaporous snake venom into your face."
2,"And two more things to keep in mind throughout, and afterwards:"
2,"1. It gets easier.  After a while, not only do you not want one, you can't even stand the smell of smoke any more."
2,"2. DO NOT think you're over it, and it's safe to have """"just one"""" at a party or something.  You aren't, and it isn't.  You're an alcoholic on the wagon."

2,"One day, while suffering through another cessation, it just dawned on me from out of the blue...I realized the reason I was having such a problem quitting: I was allowing myself to be consumed with the idea of quitting, to the point of constantly thinking about cigarettes. I was broadcasting the fact that I was quitting to my friends and family, with updates, pleas of encouragement, etc...I was constantly thinking about smoking by thinking about NOT smoking...ACTIVELY thinking about it always, until I broke down and smoked, to stop 'torturing' myself; I would beat myself up for cheating, then give up, not willing to further disappoint myself."
2,"One day, I just decided to stop. No broadcasting it to my loved ones/friends/Facebook. No looking for encouragement...no concentration on the process. I just stopped. Now, I did have the usual 'withdrawal' period, but I suffered it in silence, and surprisingly, it wasn't as bad this time, because I wouldn't allow myself to dwell on it. I took a few days off from work, and went to the Outer Banks/Virginia Beach area...I had never been, and figured a break from the norm would further get me away from my habit triggers. Plus, the excitement of seeing new places kept my mind off of it. A week later, I returned home, feeling refreshed and relaxed....and smoke-free."

But it didn't work. I always find myself consuming a few more sticks than what I intended and after some time I officially forgot I'm trying to quit and I'm back smoking a full pack a day again. I tried to quit four times before my fifth year of smoking, but all failed."
2,"Then a little over my fifth year into smoking, I just said to myself """"Fuck it, I don't like the feelings I get from smoking."""" I stopped cold turkey. The previous day I smoked more than half pack, the next day I didn't smoked any at all. Withdrawal symptoms were intense though. I feel like I'm losing my mind. """"Go to the store!"""" my mind tells me. After a few days, I gave up, and followed what my head is telling me. """"Go to the store,"""" it says so I went to the store. I was about to buy a pack when suddenly I realized I'm already several days smoke-free. I bought a softdrink instead."
2,"And that's how it's been. Whenever my mind tells me to go to the store, pressumably to buy cigarettes, I would go but I would buy a softdrink instead. This continued on for the next few months. Eventually I got an addiction for softdrinks and not the cigarettes. When I realized I no longer crave for even a stick of cigarette, it's huge sigh of relief. Yeah, I became a softdrink addict in the process but unlike with cigarettes, I found it easier to quit softdrinks."
2,"Today I'm smoke-free for more than a year now. Whenever I find myself in situations where I would smoke in the past, I'll go to the store and buy a different thing instead."

I continued to look up the changes in my body that would happen after a certain length of time without a cigarette.  For example, within twenty minutes after a cigarette, your pulse rate, temperature and blood pressure will have returned to normal.  This motivated me to keep going.  I had felt health problems coming on more often while I smoked so to know that my body was healing, helped me in successfully quitting."""
2,"""3 years without a cigarette here:"
2,"It was a change of my behavior.  I was deployed and smoked in a pattern.  When I came home, I didn't have the same patterns.  """
2,"""I am 35 years old and I started dipping when I was 11.  I quit about 18 months ago.  I quit several times before that, but I would only be able to go about 1-3 months at a time before I started again."
2,"This time, I feel like I have done it.  Believe it or not, helping a friend deal with alcoholism was eye opening for me.  My friend cannot handle Alcohol.  One drink spins into a week long black out bender.  Despite everyone pleading with him and several """"rock bottom"""" moments, he would always go right back to it.  In the end, he had to decide for himself that he COULDN'T drink.  Not a single sip."
2,I'm the same way with tobacco.  I like it.  I enjoy it.  But I don't want it anymore.  So my first step was making that decision.  My next step was sticking to that decision.  That part was the hard part.  I'll tell you my two steps and maybe they will help you...
2,"STEP 1 - Deciding I wanted to quit.  I always knew in the back of my mind that tobacco is like Russian Roulette.  The longer you play, the worse your odds get.  And I had always planned to quit at some point.  Now I have a family with two kids.  One day I had a sore in my lip that I didn't know what it was.  I started to think....""""Is this *it*?  ...Do I have mouth cancer?"""".  Then I started to think how very stupid I would feel if I had to look my wife and daughters in the eyes and tell them I wouldn't be around much longer because of a stupid habit.  I liked it, but was it worth it?  For me, it was not.  But I had to make that decision on my own.  I had to WANT to quit.  Every other time, I was quitting for other people."
2,"STEP 2 - Sticking to the decision.  Not a single time.....  I quickly realized that one dip turned into two.  Two turned into buying my own can.  Then it's off to the races.  I would convince myself that I could handle just one without starting back up.  And every single time, I was wrong.  So once, I came to the realization that I personally cannot handle dip...I was golden.  That's not to say I don't still have temptation.  But I just have to remember that I have that hard, fast rule.... Not a single time."
2,"BTW, for me personally this included all substitutes.  I tried pouches, I tried Snus, Shredded mint, Shredded beef jerky, even putting gum in my lip.  But it was always a slippery slope and even if they were tobacco free, all of them kept the habit alive."
2,"Now I'm 18 months in and going strong.  But just like they say in AA...you take it one day at a time.  Which basically means you have to stay on guard all the time, every day.  You can't ever consider yourself to have """"crossed the finish line"""" and assume that it's all behind you.  If you are like me, you are a tobacco addict.  And even if you don't use tobacco, you are still an addict.  Your body and brain will still respond the same way if you have tobacco after a 10 year absence.  So you have to stay vigilant."
2,"Also, as a footnote... I consider it a challenge.  I imagine it as me vs. the craving.  Can I persevere?  Can I be stronger than the temptation?  """"I won't let this fucker beat me.""""  So I hold strong.  Hope that helps."""
2,"""My daughter."
2,"I started at age 11, when my sister realized I wouldn't be able to tell on her if she got me to start doing it too.  We lived in a small town in Missouri, it was the mid-90's, and there were plenty of older teens & early 20-somethings around who were willing to buy them for us, in addition to that shady convenience store who would sell cigarettes to any little kid who said they were for Mom or Dad."
2,"I quit when I went to boarding school for the last couple years of high school, but started again as soon as I got back home & could actually buy them myself, legally.  I really liked cloves."
2,"I didn't smoke while I was pregnant, at 21 years old, but being around my kid's dad who still smoked, and having a """"smoking room"""" in the back of our house, was too much for me to handle & I started again a couple months after she was born."
2,"Tried to quit many times.  Quit cold turkey for a solid week, right before I was assaulted very badly by my daughter's dad.  He went to jail that night, and I discovered a pack of cloves (now banned in the US) in my luggage while packing to leave him."
2,"Several years later, my daughter started coughing.  It was winter & everyone was sick off & on, but this cough just wouldn't ever really go away.  For months, she coughed; sometimes not as bad & sometimes alarmingly bad.  I took her to the doctor several times, but there wasn't anything measurably wrong with her.  She wasn't sick, per se, but she had been recently, so that *might* explain it, kind-of.  Then, the doc had an epiphany.  The cigarette smoke.  She was reacting to it, on me, on my skin & clothes, the upholstery of the car.  I didn't smoke around my daughter, never inside, & not in the car with her.  But the residue coats everything.  The cough wasn't going to go away on its own; she would likely end up developing asthma as a result of the chronic exposure to tobacco smoke residue."
2,"That made up my mind for me.  I was no longer a smoker.  I took her home, went to the store & bought a bunch of industrial cleaning products. Scrubbed the inside of my car, washed all our clothes & bedding & coats & scarves & couch blankets.  I didn't smoke again, and her cough went away within a week.  That was 2 years ago."
2,"Tl;dr - Smoked from a young age, couldn't kick it until my habit was on the way to giving my child asthma.  Quit cold turkey the day the doctor told me to.  Two years strong."""
2,the girl I fancied found cigarettes to be revolting.
2,"""I smoked for 25 years..   The key is to quit fucking lying to yourself or making lame excuses and just stop smoking.  Yeah, sometimes it sucks, especially during the first month, but you got yourself into a shitty situation, now get yourself out."
2,"Deciding to actually quit worked best.  I got it in my mind that I'm no longer a smoker and stopped.  No bullshit about 'only if I drink' or 'only socially', or using e-cigarettes.  I stopped smoking (mostly) in certain places, like in the car, certain social situations, before work, etc.  This helped a little, but I found I'd just smoke more during the times I was allowed to smoke."
2,"So, cold turkey worked best.  I went back to smoking a few times during the first 4 months, but would accept the relapse and try again.  Counting days since my last smoke helped a bit - trying to beat my last record.  Then on my 4th fall I said, 'fuck this - no more'  and it's now been 14+ months."""

2,"""I set a date well into the future. I think I decided in December, and selected 4/1 (I know) as my quit date."
2,"Then I told everyone. I talked about it. A lot. I built up my social obligation to follow through. Meanwhile, I had time for it to start to feel real, to become integrated into my day-to-day life. All this time I smoked as much as I ever did, without worrying about it."
2,"On 3/31 I bought a pack, invited all my friends to my """"great smoke out"""", smoked myself silly. Walked home with my girlfriend at bartime, smoked the last one, and threw it out only half-done. Done."
2,"My problem was I'd always try to quit on a whim, but I had no investment in it, so as soon as I got a craving I'd say """"fuck it"""". No one would know that I'd failed, and I could tell myself that I wasn't all that serious about it in the first place. What really worked for me was creating a commitment device that would significantly raise the price of failure. Also give yourself something to do when the cravings hit - they general don't last that long, but having a plan in place for how to approach them is good; whether that's gum or whatever."

2,"Setting  a date allows you to prepare for the smoking cessation. This helps with the psychological aspect of the addiction.  You cannot just up and quit, you MUST prepare for it."

I've tried quitting in the past and always failed miserably within a couple days if not hours.  My job is also a huge trigger.  This time I did a couple things differently that I think have had a big impact on the success I've seen so far."
2,"My advice, ditch the e-cig.  If you want to do nicotine replacement go with patches and gum.  The real insidiousness of smoking is the ritualistic aspect of it.  So many day to day activities end up getting associated with smoking in our brains, things like waking up in the morning, or eating, or drinking coffee.  I think to have any real success you have to break those patterns and an e-cig is too similar to the real thing.  You hold it the same, the delivery system is the same.  It doesn't do anything to beak any of the established smoking patterns and if anything reinforces them.  With patches and gum you can keep your nicotine levels stable enough to mitigate most cravings and you're not perpetuating the smoking rituals."
2,[Don't tell anyone you're quitting](http://lifehacker.com/5921478/shhh-keeping-quiet-may-help-you-achieve-your-goals).  Seriously.  Pick one or two people to be your support system and only tell them.  I still haven't even told my mother yet and the only thing I could tell her that would make her any happier would be an announcement that she's going to be a grandmother.
2,"Don't make a big deal out of it.  By that I mean don't tie quitting to any kind of anniversary, or birthday, or any significant date.  Think about how many people succeed with New Years Resolutions and avoid that mentality.  Make it low key in your mind.  Don't think about how you can never smoke again forever, break it down to minutes if you have to."
2,When my patches showed up in my mailbox ([thanks Quit Line](https://www.quitnow.net)) I put one on and told myself I'd just see how it goes.

2,"If you're going to use gum chew it on a schedule.  Don't wait for a craving because you're just reinforcing the habit that way.  Do some push-ups, or walk around the block instead when you get a tough craving.  It's all about creating new patterns."
2,"7 days ago I ran out of patches.  I considered buying more and stepping them down (was using 21mg) but thought I'd try a day on gum only and evaluate from there.

2,"Smoked for 12 years (16-28).  I was a pack a day smoker, which would go up to three packs if I was out drinking.  I would smoke the last thing before I slept and before I did anything else in the morning.  Oh, and sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night to smoke.  I Was having racing heart, so I went to a cardiologist.  He told me I was using too much caffeine, nicotine, and that I needed to quit smoking.  My mom had smoked my entire childhood, and kept smoking through her MS diagnosis, multiple bouts of bronchitus, and brain aneurism.  I myself had smoked through bronchitus.  I knew I needed to stop, but had failed multiple times after initial success with the patch, so I took the doc's advice on how to do it."
2,"Every other day, I would smoke one less cigarette.  So day one, I had 20, day three I had 19, until I eventually got down to zero.  The value of this method is that I avoided withdrawal, and was hyper-conscious of every cigarette.  I became aware of how I used cigs to treat myself, to address boredom, to console myself, and for any other imaginable reason.  I also came to see that it really did none of those things.  The best thing it did for me was give me a chance to take a break sometimes.  Something I could do anyway without the smoke."
2,"Also, the difficulty of quitting (both psychologically, and the drawn-out process) made me never want to go through it again.  I think that's the problem with the patch.  Too easy.  If you go through the torment of quitting, you remember it and never want to have to face it again!"

2,Apparently they both bind to the same receptors. And it's cheap - a 240 count of 500mg tablets is available from GNC for $18.99 - I guess this is one of the reasons that the doctors and pharmaceutical companies don't push it because they can't make a big markup on it like they do with Nicorette and the patch.

2,"I was at a community college at the time, living at home, and my parents had finally given up on trying to get me to quit.

2,"There's really alot more to it though. The liquids you use need to be dependable and to your liking. If you have an e liquid that you THINK you like, find one you DO like. I stayed away from tobacco flavors in favor of the fruit/drink flavors which I think greatly helped me move on."
2,"The liquids also have a strength factor to them called PG and VG. certain percentages of each can determine the strength of each """"hit"""" and can help you move on from the tabacco too. For example, I smoked lights, so 50/50 or 60PG/40VG was as close as I came to simulating the light feeling. If you smoke regulars or methol, you may want to use higher VG for the better """"throat hit""""."
2,"Nicotine levels are of course important too. If you buy a E-Cig from a local gas station or wherever, they typically have 12mg per E-Cig which simulates the NIC levels of someone who smokes less than a pack a day.

She started using e-cigarettes a few years ago before they became ubiquitous in convenience stores and still costed $100+.

I purchased a kit from an exceptionally helpful local vapor shop.  Two tanks, two batteries, charger, enough heating elements to last a couple months.  With this kit I could use two flavors. One reminiscent of the brand I smoked, one just mint (± like mint).  That way I could ween myself off the tobacco taste, as well as the nicotine.  I was also able to have the vapor shop prepare the e liquid in diminishing strengths to gradually reduce my dependence there as well.  Started at 12mg/ml and dropped the dose by 2mg/ml each time I needed more liquid.  I was off cigarettes within 2 weeks and 8 months later don't vape anymore either.

It was a very bad case, with IV antibiotics, and that was when I first realized lung disease was no joke. It's not like having a broken bone where you can just """"rest it"""", you have to keep breathing 24x7. It hurt, excruciatingly. The worst was trying to sleep and waking in pain having to lift my body to roll over, the sudden exertion and laying on one side felt like a sword piercing through my side.

She told me how her dad died of lung cancer and would never date a smoker because she didn't want to go through that again. Understandable. She texted me and asked if I smoked. I looked at the lit cigarette in my hand decided finding out if this girl was worth it was better than slowly killing myself. I ground the half a cigarette out and texted her back to tell her I was quitting. I had my last cigarette a couple of days later. She and I then started dating and are still together.

Eventually I completely phased out cigarettes (although I still had cravings for a cigarette after meals and when drinking alcohol) and would just puff on an E-cig to get that nicotine fix my brain and body were craving for. From this point I was using medium-nicotine and switched to low-nicotine, then to no-nicotine liquids. Then one day I just didn't feel like puffing anymore."
2,This took a total of 6 months and I have been nicotine free for the past 4 months. I highly recommend one starts exercising during this time for 3 reasons: 1 is endorphins; 2 is so you can really feel how terrible your breathing is when you're smoking and exercising (and to also note the improvement over time); 3 is you may start to notice weight gain once you stop smoking.

Since that point, I decided I want to be the best I can be, mentally and physically. So I prepared myself for a lifestyle-paradigm shift. I exercise multiple times a week, I'm studying to become a doctor, I'm taking responsibility for my body and my actions. And recently I've begun no-fap. As a 24-year-old, I feel that biological development has brought me to the peak of my growth, and at this stage in life, it's up to me, my actions/decisions, to keep myself developing upward. Because from this point on, if you do not input energy into that upward curve that is you're early life, the curve will start going downhill."

2,"I'll use emotional eating as an example to simplify but smoking is no different, I can usually break emotional eating in one or two sessions however smoking does take a bit more work."
2,"Basically as a child, teen or at some point in our lives we seek out food to sooth us.  If we do this often enough the subconscious then associates a craving (ie chocolate) as an appropriate response to a trigger (overwhelment for example).  It then begins to fire off hunger cravings for that particular food when that emotion sets in.  This is a subconscious pattern that you don't know exists and you have no control in consciously changing on your own, similar to anxiety."
2,With the help of a practitioner that specializes in the subconscious (using NLP - neuro linguistic programming) you can very easily reprogram that behavior.  Before xmas I helped someone change their overeating when feeling overwhelmed to going to their office and writing (which was the new desired state). It took about 40 minutes total.

2,"""3 things: 1) Progressively limit your cigarette intake 2) Cut back on any drinking you already do 3) Start having sex as often as possible with a non-smoker"
2,The whole process will take you about one month to complete.
2,"1-  Let's say that you smoke a pack(20) a day. On the first day, buy your usual brand of smokes (do not buy lights if you don't already smoke those), open the pack and remove two cigs. Toss them in the trash, keep them in a box, whatever doesn't matter as long as you will not have easy access to them. Either the next day or two days form then when you buy another pack remove 4 cigs and discard them. Repeat the steps as the days progress buy removing two plus cigs per day until buy the end of the process you buy a pack only to smoke two cigarettes. (BONUS: It will occur to you that you just spent almost $7 pending on where you live for two GD cigs and you will wonder why you even smoke in the first place)"
2,2- This one is simple. Cut back on any alcohol consumption because as you are probably already aware of when you're drinking you're smoking. If you're drinking less then you're less likely to light up another smoke.
2,"3- Probably the most important. If you aren't already, start having sex with a non-smoker. Quitting smoking can really increase the amount of sex you are having and trust me nothing will get you denied faster then when your SO hates that you smell (and taste) like smoke. This can be mutually beneficial too. Get your partner in on providing an incentive not to smoke, I'm not saying trade sex for not smoking but rather that if both you and your SO are non-smokers sex will be much more enjoyable for both of you. (BONUS: It's a proven fact that smoking does hinder your sexual performance, long term smoking does cause the blood vessels in you body to shrink and shrinking blood vessels may lead to shrinking pecker.)"""

2,"Basically, for about four weeks before quitting I changed up my routines. No smoking in the car, no smoking right after a meal, no smoking right when I woke up. I'd put my cigarettes in the trunk of my car, after a meal I would wash all the dishes or finish whatever I was watching on TV before a smoke, etc. Then, one day I smoked my usual pack and the next day when I woke up, I put a patch on and I haven't smoked in 7 years. Once I had broken up those usual smoking habits and the patch took care of the actual physical craving for nicotine, it was easy. I thought I would never be able to quit, but really, it was one of the easiest things I've ever done."""

NOTE:  your competing response should be something you LIKE.

2,I set a date. Decided that was going to be the last day. I worked my way into quitting but limiting the amount I was allowed to have each day. I was at a pack a day. Then I limited myself to half a pack a day for 4 days. then it was 6 a day for 3 days. then 3 a day. then at the date. none. and thats that.
2,"""I tried only once, and I've been smoke free for about 4-5 years.  It's been long enough that I don't really keep track of anniversaries.  Here are several tricks that worked for me."
2,"1. **Set a quit date.** When I decided to quit, I didn't do it that day.  I did it a few weeks later.  This is a time-tested trick, because it helps you prepare yourself, and come to terms with saying goodbye to something that's felt like (but not really been) a friend for years."
2,"2. **Visualize cigarettes as a slave driver.** It really helped my motivation to quit, to *really* recognize that I was addicted to nicotine.  This meant paying attention to everything I did in the name of smoking that wasn't good for me; it included throwing away $6 every day, smoking even when my throat was hurting, and going out into the bitter cold when it was nice and warm inside.  I started to think of it cracking a whip at me, saying shit like """"What do you mean, it's cold outside?  Bitch, I *own* you.  *wha-pish!*"""""
2,"3. **Do it with a buddy.** I quit at the same time as my girlfriend.  It was her idea, really, and she'd been doing it for about 20 years, compared to 5-6 years for me.  Nobody wants to the pussy who quits quitting first."
2,"4. **Go on vacation when you quit, preferably as far away from society as you can get.** This is probably the biggest help, and works on many levels.  We smoke when we're stressed, and there are so many triggers to smoke in our daily lives; getting away from that reduces temptation.  We also turn into irritable assholes when we quit, and getting away from society means you don't take other people down with you when you're in your hole.  Finally, if you're camping in the middle of the woods, it's hopefully a long, long way to the nearest gas station.  They say cravings only last for a few minutes at a time when you get them, and if it takes you well over a few minutes to get to a pack, chances are good you'll talk yourself out of it by the time you get there."
2,"5. **Never, ever, EVER smoke again.** This may sound stupid, but a lot of people fail a quit attempt because they're not planning on quitting forever.  It's easier to think about quitting if, somewhere in the back of your mind, you're thinking about someday in the future where you haven't had a cigarette in three months, and say, """"hey, I quit! This means I can have a cigarette *every once in a while* but I won't keep smoking.""""  That's lying to yourself and exactly how you get back into the cycle.  It hurts a lot more to quit *properly*, but that's the only way you're going to do it.  NEVER. SMOKE. AGAIN."

2,I'm 100% serious. It's a simple technique that will get you through the hard shit.
2,"You're going to be a dick anyway because of withdrawal. So instead of fighting it and stressing yourself out more, *embrace it.*"
2,"There is some nuance to this that you'll have to navigate a bit. Obviously, you can't just crank up the dickitude to eleven and start peeing on the menu outside Jack In The Box. What you *can* do is relieve some stress by venting to some very supportive friends who can be amused to see an uncharacteristically aggressive you.^1"
2,"Also, you'll need some structure to avoid going insane. Let's face it, there are some terrifying consequences going at this without a plan. You don't want to become an asshole permanently, do you?"
2,So!
2,Step One: Tell your friends and co-workers that you're about to be an asshole.
2,"This is vital. They need to know what's up and why ahead of time so they can a) enjoy the show and b) be supportive. It's also important to approach this step very carefully. Don't just say """"I'm going to quit smoking and it's going to make me a raging tool so you're all going to have to deal with me."""""
2,Apologize preemptively instead.
2,"Example: """"Look, I am so sorry to do this to you guys but I've decided to quit smoking. It's something I'd like for myself. I really need your help on this because I'm afraid I'm going to be short with people and rude and obnoxious for a few days until the nicotine is out of my system and I want to say I'm sorry before it even happens. I promise I'll make it up to you when it's all over. I'll get you some lunch!"""""
2,"A couple points on step one. First, be sincere in your apology. Sincerity is important. Empathize with what these folks are about to go through. Put yourself in their position and imagine someone is telling you the same thing. Second: promises of small presents or food have to be fulfilled later so keep track of that shit. It's necessary to the program to get out of asshole phase as quickly as possible, not to mention it's the right thing to do."
2,Step Two: Give away your cigarettes.
2,"Don't throw them away, give them away to a smoker! It's silly to be wasteful. As soon as you've notified everybody you can think of that you're going to be a colossal fuck-head for a little while, stop with the cigarettes right then and there. Don't make a big deal about the last cigarette ever. Just stop. The sooner you get this shit over with, the better. Which means the sooner you stop, the sooner it will end."
2,Step Three: Be A Fucking Asshole.
2,"This is going to suck. You're not going to like how withdrawal feels. You're going to want to punch a baby. And that's okay! Not baby punching, don't do that, but don't punish yourself for thought-crime that you can't control. You're allowed to think about the punchibility of the faces of infants."
2,"Luckily, in Step One, you've shored up a lot of support with folks that know what you're going through, even if they're not smokers themselves. They know that it's making your uncomfortable and they know the manifestation of that discomfort."
2,"When you are in the company of these supportive heroes, remember to vent *to* them, not *at* them. That is to say, complain about whatever tiny things happen to be pushing you over the edge at the given moment but don't blame them or yell at them. Try to get them to understand, instead. They won't, but it's better this way."
2,"Example of correct assholishness: """"Jesus Fucking Christ why can't they make these goddamn motherfucking cups just a TINY BIT leakproof? LOOK AT THIS SHIT. I got drips on my desk like I'm a fucking toddler. FUCK."""""
2,"Example of incorrect assholishness: """"You guys switched my fucking cup, didn't you. I have enough shit to deal with right now and you fuckers gave me the leaky one. I know somebody did because I never had fucking drips on my fucking desk before fucking this fucking morning. Fuck you."""""
2,"Also, be in mind not to take out too much aggression on people not in your circle of heroes, so to speak. If you haven't let them in on your plan, you don't get to be a dick to them. You can talk about them later or scream in your car with the windows down but don't go ape-shit at the poor sales associate at WalMart because they don't have those seasonal poptarts you liked."
2,"Also, be aware of people trying to take advantage of you while you're in asshole phase. Some people are *real* assholes. Every day of their lives. And some of them never smoked a day in their life, that's just how they are. These people might try to provoke you or aggravate you into saying something stupid and then punish you for it. You can prepare for such people by avoiding them when possible and bitching about them later when you can't. Being aware of them is usually enough to neutralize their threat."
2,Step Four: The Comedown
2,"Okay! You're over the worst of it. It's been a few days to a week and now when you're being a dick, it's just you being a dick and not the chemical reactions inside you *making* you a dick. So you're going to find that you can stop being a dick more easily. Suddenly, you have a lot more control than you did before."
2,This is the point where it all makes sense.
2,"Unfortunately, the transition between the two states is murky and confusing. The control comes and goes. You can't quite figure out where you begin and the addiction ends for a day or so. And that's okay, too. Just keep plugging away and take out some stress by venting to your heroes same as usual until you're ready. When you feel like yourself again, you're going to think you're done."
2,You're going to be around a smoker and suddenly you're okay. Suddenly you don't need it. It's all good.
2,But you're not done yet.
2,Step Five: Keeping promises
2,"Buy your co-workers some pizzas. Give a gift-certificate to a particular person that you screamed to a little too loudly. Personalize these gifts. You weren't in a fugue state the whole time, you're going to remember it all. Apologize, apologize, apologize."
2,Make an effort to be conspicuously nice and kind and friendly. Let the world know it's over.
2,"And get yourself a little something, too."
2,Because you fucking did it.
2,"And now, maybe you have some special insight into the worst of your own behavior, a measuring stick by which your future actions can always be compared. You're going to have a handle on things better than most, I'd think. And you'll be better for it."
2,Good luck.
2,"^1. This plan doesn't work if you're already an asshole."""

I knew it was bad bc, well, science and facts, but I felt no consequences personally- yet. It didn't effect my health, I worked with & hung out with mostly smokers, and I just enjoyed smoking. After about 7-8 years of it, I started coughing every morning, experienced shortness of breath, and was around more non-smokers which made me more aware of how I smelled. Something I did to fit in socially was now ostracizing me. I started dating a non-smoker who never made me feel bad about smoking, but served as a reflection of how self-conscious I was about it myself, which I had never been shown until then. I was paranoid about how I smelled, tasted, looked smoking, aware of how out of breath I was just walking stairs. I realized I didn't enjoy it anymore. I hated it and hated myself for it. Once I experienced that level of self-loathing, cigarettes became the enemy and I quit cold turkey.

It was an easy change to go for coffee or get some water or even go do something else in another room.

2,"I think the reason why this was feasible for me was the other thing I mentioned, NA meetings. Staying on chantix for 6 months matters because it gets you accustomed to not smoking for an extended period of time, however I was able to use the tools I'd gained from staying away from other drugs and apply that to cigarettes. IE- Don't pick up the first one and you wont have the ones that follow. It's a simple concept, but for people who have been addicted to something, they know how it works. You have one, it turns out to be enjoyable and you think, okay I can do this once in awhile. It's more fun this way, once in awhile.

In this respect it is similar to cytisine and different from the nicotinic antagonist, bupropion, and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) like nicotine patches and nicotine gum.

Many insurance providers don't pay for Chantix but may pay for Wellbutrin, though if you decide to go with medication you need to be vigilant and watch for any personality or mood changes. If people around you say that you've been acting differently or if you feel different in an unpleasing way, you need to stop taking the medication IMMEDIATELY. Your prescribing doctor or pharmacist can give you clearer information than I, and I recommend that you consult with them rather than trusting to contents of this thread.

Initially, those battles fall one right after the other.  But with each day, week, month and year, those battles become fewer and further between.  I've lost that battle a few times.

I don't smoke every time I drink or I'm around smokers, but sometimes the mood strikes, and I partake."
2,"From what I gather, I'm unusual in that the actual habitual part was the harder thing to break than the chemical addition.  I rarely feel the absolute physical need for a smoke, but it would be nice to go stand outside for 10 minutes, and smoking was the thing that I'd do to pass the time when I did that.

At first, it was weird to go to a gas station without buying a pack, but I got used to it, and I found that it was much easier to talk myself out of having a cigarette if there were none around to smoke, so I was using my laziness to prevent my smoking.  If I had a pack around, I'd finish them, and then no more.  Really, I was only able to really quit for extended periods of time once I was no longer around smokers on a regular basis."
2,"So anyway, I realize I'm probably not a good case to emulate, but it works for me.  I'm sure I still do some level of damage with this level of smoking, but it must be less than smoking a pack a day, and it's a level I'm happy with. """

What I did almost every night was drink and play quitar by myself.. sounds sad but what I was doing was getting used to being drunk and playing music without cigs so the desire wasn't there as much when I was with friends.  First day or two it was hard, but quickly became easier.  Then when I started hanging out with friends I would just do small groups at first, I would avoid big parties.

At this time cigarettes were around 4-5 a pack (not sure how much they are now) but I knew there were lots of things I would rather spend $120-$150 a month on. One day, I woke up and I said to myself """"Im done. I'm not going to smoke today."""""
2,"The important thing to remember with something like this is to not look too far ahead. Don't focus on how you are going to get through the week without cigarettes. Focus on getting through the next hour, the rest of the day, then the next day."
2,"Another important thing (and you HAVE to commit to this) is that it is absolutely CRUCIAL that you remove yourself from any situation where you would want to smoke. For me, it was bars and drinking in general. I knew that drinking would absolutely trigger me to want to smoke and that I would definitely give in. So I also decided at that time that I would quit drinking. It was only supposed to be temporary but the health benefits were so great that I quit drinking altogether. I might have a glass of wine or champagne once or twice a year, but ultimately I no longer drink socially. You have to treat it like what it is: an addiction. Which means you should also remove yourself from any situation where others will be smoking (like friends that smoke or co-workers that smoke). Find a distraction or different vice. I used licorice, hard candy and/or coffee."
2,"The places that require the most discipline to not smoke are in the car while driving and after a big meal. You can't really remove yourself from those situations so those are the times when you have to call on your discipline to stop you from lighting up. I would make sure I always had my favorite CD's in the car (hey, it was the early '00s) and I would play all my favorite songs and sing along with them. It sounds stupid but it worked for me. It gave my mouth something to do other than smoking (insert dirty joke here)."
2,"The HARDEST part is getting through the first week. But by the end of your second week you will begin to see the cravings decrease. In my opinion, the biggest factors in quitting smoking are determination (you have to really want it) and discipline. Your mind is very powerful. You can do this! Good luck!"

2,"""I simply quit buying them. Smoked for 15 years, decided one morning I didn't want to do it anymore. I believe you have to actively quit.

No help, no whining or excuses. I just stopped. I think it works so well because if you can get through the hell of those first few weeks without smoking, you: 1. Don't want to ever go through that again, and 2. Know that you are capable of succeeding on your own. It makes a big difference. My motivation for the last few times I quit was not wanting to touch my kids with my gross smoke-hands, and having a reason that really mattered to me was important, too.

2,"""First you have to decide you actually want to quit. once i made the choice for myself, (not because my husband was telling me to, or because my parents were on my ass), i stocked up on sunflower seeds and toothpicks. Sunflower seeds helped for when i was outside or in my car. otherwise, just keeping a toothpick in my mouth helped calm the urges. the chemical addiction is gone after 3 days, the rest is all mental. You got this. """
2,"""Willpower first of all, followed by a replacement """"ritual"""" really helped me. The cravings are really tough the first couple of days but eventually pass, just force yourself to do something else everytime you have a craving, whether it's a little gesture, which is what I replaced it with, along with repeating a mantra in my mind everytime I got a craving."
2,"I'm coming up on 5 years w/out a cigarette and can say the cravings mostly pass, although there will ALWAYS be times, especially when stressed, when I want one. """
2,"""Cold turkey worked best for me, I used toothpicks the time before last and stayed off em for 28 months. """
2,"""I got pregnant. When I found out, I immediately halved the amount I was smoking. It took me about 3 weeks to be completely smoke free. I wished I could have quit cold turkey, but finding out I was pregnant was crazy stressful, and when I'm stressed I smoke."
2,"It my not be feasable for you to get pregnant, but it worked for me!"""
2,"""It really was just having the utmost desire to quit."
2,"To get that desire I had to go through a lot. First I grew up with my father as a smoker, and I hated it. Then in my teens he dated a woman who was a smoker, I hated it too. She had even quit once (but started smoking in front of me again on my birthday I was pissed)."
2,"Of course later in my teen years, peer pressure, desire to be cool, following in my parents footsteps, etc. I started smoking. I got pretty heavy into it and was a pack a day guy within a couple of years. I tried to quit many many times but really didn't have enough motivation to go through with it."
2,"Then I watched my father die of cancer. It was heartbreaking, and the memory of sitting next to him in his bedroom as he took his final breath haunts me to this day. But even that wasn't enough."
2,"What finally got it to stick was deciding to have a kid ... I didn't want her to grow up and watch me die the same way. So I got the patch and 2 weeks later I ditched that. I haven't been a smoker since (I relapsed once for a night a few months later but thats it). Its ultimately my desire to want to set a good standard for my daughter that keeps me off of it. I still get the cravings and its been 12 years since I quit. """
2,"""I smoked weed everytime I wanted to smoke a cigarette. Not to get high...just to smoke. I would smoke 5-10 joints a day. After a couple weeks, I got sick of being high all the time. 2 years into quitting now. Wouldnt even call myself a smoker anymore, and I don't smoke weed anymore either!!!"""
2,"""Chantix was my savior. Tried several times without and just couldn't do it. After about a week of taking it the 'buzz' you get goes away and cigs taste HORRIBLE. You also are cutting back during the week because you don't have that pressure as often or as strong. So then you stop. It will suck for a couple of days, you will be grumpy, you will have CRAZY VIVID dreams. These dreams can be bad if you have bad dreams anyway, I fortunately, do not have that problem."
2,"For me at about a month or so in the pills started making me nauseous, this happens to a lot of people, but I just started cutting the pills in half and that let me taper off of them."
2,"The first time I did this I went about three years without. Then made the mistake of smoking one night when drunk. Then started back within the next month. Did the cycle again and now haven't smoked in a couple of years. The urges still exist but when I get them and they are bad I tell my self that if I smoke one, then I will smoke 10,000 and it just isn't worth it."""
2,"""First, you need to be yourself totally sick of smoking and have this incessant desire to quit. You must be totally convinced in the head that smoking is disgusting and there's absolutely NO good reason you should smoke another cigarette in your life."
2,"Once you get there, just quit cold turkey. Man up and ride out the urges the first few weeks."""
2,"""Social pressure. None of my friends smoke. I work in the health care field. None of my colleagues smoke. The ones that did, quit. When I go outside to smoke a cigarette, I get bored. That's it, really. """
2,"""Sunflower seeds.  But then I had to use cigarettes to kick my seeds addiction."
2,But in all seriousness cold turkey worked for me.  You just need to be strong as shit.  Working retail jobs don't help either.

2,My uncles death from lung cancer (lifetime smoker).
2,it's you vs yourself in this situation.  who will come out on top?
2,What worked for me (second attempt) was quitting cold turkey but with an actual reason to quit. The reason was my willpower on bad days. I also set out to develop a new way to cope with stress since that was when I felt most dependant on cigarettes. I would remove myself from any stressful situation at the first opportunity and take a walk for a couple of minutes. Good luck!
2,"""Pregnancy. Had to quit cold turkey, totally worked out."""
2,"""Quite simple, actually."
2,"I got sick of being out of breath, smelling, and doing something I knew was shit for my overall well being. So I quit. No goals, deals, gimmicks or games."
2,"Its all willpower and mental strength. I didn't need """"gum"""" or """"lollipops"""" to offset the cravings. It was quite simple, actually. I feel those who say its so hard don't really have the desire to quit, they just think they do."

2,"""When I quit, it was two months after I got to watch my grandfather die of lung cancer, and I decided that's not the way I want to go.  For me the memory of his last few weeks really helped me through the trying times.  I used an e-cig as a crutch for about a week, moved to the nicotine-free cartridges, and really, kept drinking a ton of water.  I was never so hydrated.  Cigarette cravings seemed to decrease after slamming 20 oz of cold water.  Doing non-smoking activities (go to the movies, bowling, keep your hands and mind occupied).  One of my friends gave me a stress ball that I kept in my coat pocket that I used while walking around outside, when I would usually be smoking.  Driving was difficult, we don't realize the rituals we set for ourselves until we try to change them.  Once again, water and LOUD music seemed to get me over this hump.  But mostly, I really really really wanted it.  There's no magic bullet.  It's going to suck, and it's going to suck a lot.  But having that motivation is what grinds you through.  For me it was not wanting my kids to go through what my mom and uncles went through with their dad, that slow decline, that agonizing end.  But it could be anything.  Money you save.  Your general health.  Lower insurance rates.  As long as that's stronger than the temporary desire to light up, you'll get through this.  Signed, ex-smoker of 16 years, tobacco free for three."""
2,I was put on wellbutrin for mild depression.  The pills didn't help my mood....but they made me never want to smoke. It actually looked gross to me after I started.  I'm still smoke free. Hooray!
2,A family member of mine was diagnosed with lung cancer and the day that happened was the day I quit cold turkey and haven't had any problems since.  Its been 2 years and I feel fine.
2,"""I went cold turkey and just refused to allow myself to take even one puff.  Don't tell yourself """"I'll just have one puff"""" or """"I'll just have one cigarette."""". That's your addiction playing tricks on you, next thing you know you bought a pack and are back to your normal level of smoking."
2,"What also helped was starting the quit when I was sick and smoking would have made me feel worse.  When I felt better I thought """"Well, I just went two days without smoking, might as well keep it going""""."
2,"Good luck."""
2,"""For me, I quit using the Nicorette inhaler.  Any brand inhaler will work.  What REALLY helped me was ignoring the filter 90% of the time.  They say you go through 2-3 a day when you smoke 1/2 - 1 pack a day, but I went through maybe 3 a week.  I would inhale on it knowing that there was no nicotine left in the filter, but the hand-to-mouth gesture was enough of a reminder to trick my brain into thinking I wasn't jonesing for nicotine."
2,"I recommend people to find a reason to quit as well, rather than just """"yeah I should quit"""".  My reason was that my girlfriend HATED it, plus I was becoming a Resident Assistant for my dorms and I didn't want to be the only RA who smoked."""
2,"""I used Chantix. The dreams were weird but fun, though towards the end I noticed I was a little more on edge than normal. I  quit for a year but relapsed due to a stressful situation and basically allowing myself to restart. I did Chantix again and have stayed away ever since. It also helps knowing (and if it's not true I still prefer ignorance)  that insurance will only pay twice in a lifetime for it. Knowing I can't get it again is a powerful deterrent. """
2,"""Quit 75 days ago. What helped me was an e-cig with a small amount of nicotine in the juice. Used it for about two weeks, smoking less and less every day until I didn't need it anymore. You can get juice with no nicotine in it, which helps with the habit and feeling of smoking. Also, being serious about quitting helps. All of my failed attempts in the past were from not really wanting to quit but feeling like I should. """

2,I was put on wellbutrin for mild depression.  The pills didn't help my mood....but they made me never want to smoke. It actually looked gross to me after I started.  I'm still smoke free. Hooray!
2,"""I quit smoking a year ago. What worked for me was cold turkey, find the reason you want to quit and stick at it. I was a pack a day smoker for 15 years."
2,"I had tried to quit smoking several times over the years and was always tripped up by """"Sure one won't hurt"""" or """"I'll only smoke at weekends"""" or """"I'll only smoke when I'm drinking"""" or """"I'll only when I'm in company"""". There's no such thing. You just got to stick at it."
2,"When I quit I read advice on the /r/stopsmoking sub, someone said that as Nicotine is carried in the blood, you need to clean your blood as soon as possible. How you do this is eat loads of fiber and anti-oxidents (blueberries, pineapple), and basically have the greatest bowel movements of your life for 2 weeks."
2,What also helped me was making fists with your toes everytime you want a cig.
2,"Be warned though, I may be a year in, but there isn't a day goes by without me still thinking I'd love a cigarette. I was at a party last week and of course, all the smokers are outside laughing and having fun, I was stuck inside with a bore. I went out to join the smokers, I didn't have a cigarette but I really wanted one."""
2,"""Having my father died, I was in my early twenties and when my father died due to lung cancer it convinced everyone in my family who smoked that we should quit or we'll end up the same way."""
2,"""I quit twice. The first time was because I said I would, and so I did. It lasted about three months, and when I got the opportunity to start up again I did. I thought at the time I would just have a smoke or two and no big deal but pretty soon I was back on the horse, looking for my stetson."
2,"The second time, I just did it. I didn't even know it was going to happen on that day. It was at the point where I was embarrassed to admit to people I met that I smoked. I wanted to quit and I was just trying to figure out when and where to do it. One day I woke up, and I was like """"I think I'm done."""" I threw away my leftover cigarettes and didn't buy any more."
2,"That was over 15 years ago now. I still dream, every now and again, about how I have an occasional smoke, or how I pick up the habit for a couple weeks at a time then quit all over again. I don't dare."
2,I think what made it easier for me was that I simply did not go places where smoking was a part of the social fabric of things. Early on I really missed the break it gave me -- 10 minutes every couple hours hanging out with the other smokers. These days I don't miss it so much.
2,"Cold turkey wasn't easy, but it was easier than anything else I tried. The second time I tried it, I knew what I was in for, and I just never let my resolve waver."""
2,"""honestly, stop trying to replace it with anything."
2,"I did not go 100% cold turkey, i used a patch for a week or two."
2,"But i had friends who tried to quit around the same time and they're still smoking, and i quit 13 years ago."
2,The mistakes i saw them make:
2,"Trying to go out and party while quitting, the first few weeks will be hard so don't put yourself in situations where you love to smoke. I just worked a lot."
2,taking the patch off to 'just have one'. Seriously?
2,Trying to quit right before we went on vacation. I had this one friend who would attempt to quit right before we would go on a yearly two week road trip when college ended. That was doomed to always fail and cause him stress.
2,To quit...you just have to quit. Just don't do it!
2,The crappy feeling will go away. The daily roller coaster of 'i feel great' to 'i feel like crap' will be replaced with...'i feel fine'.
2,"My advice is harsh because i do not have an addictive nature, so it's like when you ask someone how to do something that they have been doing for a long time, """"I don't know, you just do it""""."
2,"Truth is, the only way to quit...is to quit. To stop smoking."
2,"These e-cigs and stuff are nice but honestly i feel like you're just leaning off one crutch for another. Stand up and do it..in this case don't do it."""
2,"""So many things combined for the perfect storm, really. It was right after new years, my girlfriend had just quit, I had been leaning towards it for awhile but needed an extra push. I went out to breakfast one morning, decided I would shave my head. Hadn't shaved my head since I was in middle school. From that haircut, I never smoked a cigarette again. The first few weeks are the hardest, but now, it feels like I just never smoked, I almost never THINK about smoking, and that's the biggest thing."
2,"In your case, I would say replace it with something else. Something similar but not bad for you, I used toothpicks. They cover the oral fixation pretty well. Also use the patch, it sounds silly, but you do actually get a serious buzz the first few times, and you get that nicotine rush. I never tried the e-cigs as a quitting method, but in my observations, I've seen people just go back and forth between them and there's not enough mental separation from the e-cig to a regular cig, so people regress too easily. Toothpicks, go out for a toothpick and cell phone break."
2,""""
2,I've battled with smoking tobacco for many years. I gave up smoking completely two years ago and haven't had one since. All I did was stop. No pills; no new habit. Just stopped.
2,"""Who gives a shit how you quit, just quit. I used Chantix and it was the only thing that really helped me and I tried everything (the gum, patches, etc). It's been nearly five years since I quit and I haven't relapsed once. This is after 15+ years of smoking and Skoal. Biggest piece of advice I can give is do not think for a moment that you can """"just have one"""". That is the biggest mistake I think people make. I took the medicine for 2 months (to the dude who has been on it for 6 years WTF?!?!)"""
2,"""I had just recovered from pneumonia for the 3rd time in a year.  The third time was so crippling that I was actually afraid I was going to die.  I remember when I first got sick that third time that I was thinking, ugh, I have to quit smoking until I'm better or it's going to take forever to get over it.  Then as each day passed and I kept getting worse and worse my thought process shifted from quitting until I was better to quitting for good or I would NEVER get better."
2,"It really scared me that I thought I was going to die and as a Mom I couldn't stand the thought of leaving my kid and having him be sad and  angry at me for letting myself die over a pack and a half a day cigarette habit.  It really sobered me to realize that, realistically, I was picking my cigarettes over him.  So, that was that.  I never picked up another cigarette after I recovered from that pneumonia and it's been officially 873 days.  I've not smoked 26,212 cigarettes and I've saved $6555.00 (thanks Quit.net for the daily reminder).  :)"""
